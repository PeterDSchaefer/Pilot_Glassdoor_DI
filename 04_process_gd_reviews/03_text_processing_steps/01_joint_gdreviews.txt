Advice: None
Pros: Very nice experience of working at Apple.

Cons: No cons that I can mention.
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible, good pay, good environment

Cons: Moving to IT support was awful. Micromanaging (was called in for walking around for 1-2 min every hour because you're expected to be sitting and taking calls your ENTIRE shift) and irate customers gave me anxiety to the point of daily anxiety attacks before my shift. When I reached out for help or to be moved to a chat role I was basically told I was SOL. Moving to IT and being given completely different responsibilities from the job I actually applied for decreased not just my morale but all my coworkers to the point where most of us quit because it was no longer worth it
Advice: Stop micromanaging and actually provide mental health support to ALL employees, not just your valuable engineers and designers. Bragging during regional meetings about not having to lay anyone off isn't the flex you think it is when half the team leaves voluntarily due to the poor conditions.

Advice: None
Pros: People care here! Lots of growth

Cons: Hours are very long unfortunately
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay for apple company

Cons: Limited growth for part time employees. They seem to reserve most advancement for full time employees committed to Apple for the foreseeable future.
Advice: Roles that allow for vertical growth would be really appreciated by the people not in full time roles.
Pros: Working at Apple is quite the experience. The energy is undeniable, the people at the retail level where I work are some of the best I've ever met. Everybody is so different but everyone possesses the same quality that they truly want to help. I've never been denied genuine assistance and they have maintained a proactive and safety first approach to COVID which I appreciate every day. 



I'm a part time employee while also being a full time student. They are tremendously supportive with college schedules and as long as your availability meets the needs of the business, the company is more than flexible. Apple knows I will not be with them beyond the next year or two but they continue to push me to accomplish all I can and invite me to be my true, best self every day. It's a terrific experience and if you get the opportunity I recommend giving it a shot.

Cons: Too many to list honestly.

Advice: None
Pros: Abilitiy and education to instill comfort within doing repairs on your own. you do have someone holding your hand. they provide you with training to gain proper confidence for any repair necessary.

Cons: Old vs New mentality. Very clear hierarchy according to tenure. There are few real problems but people complain about the smallest things. Gossip culture, difficult work-life balance. People seem to hate their lives. After months of thinking about it, a few other newbies agreed that it felt like high school. Possibly specific to the Austin office. Very little focus on maintaining a positive culture with depth. Shallow realtionships.
Advice: Challenge your own management and fight for things that will enrich the culture and create more connections with the teams. Free food/ events aren't cutting it.
Pros: versatile workspace (you can work all over the building, wherever you have access to), awesome lunch venue, excellent benefits, devices provided, understanding management

Cons: Difficult to move up. Always given vague feedback as to why you weren't promoted. There isn't a work/life balance. You're held accountable for other employee's mistakes. No weekends off. Always short staffed. Budgets for store use are very low which means you sometimes can't even get a new shirt.
Advice: Take care of your staff. They work hard, even when burnt out.
Pros: Health / Medical benefits are good

Cons: long hours with challenging work
Advice: None
Pros: Nice environment and good people

Cons: No guarantees of permanent employment after working for 4-5 months, recommendations to other stores are difficult to secure, difficult to communicate with store leaders after work hours due to insulation of communications (for good reason)
Advice: The hiring team is amazing, they really do pick the most "human" people (for lack of a better word in the retail sense) and it shows. I hear though that the quality differs from store to store, but the team at Victoria Gardens was a pleasure to work with. Getting back in after being let go feels like getting kicked out of heaven though.

Advice: None
Pros: Great pay and benefits, employee discount

Cons: no growth no advancement opportunities
Advice: give more pay when more work is done because there's no incentive to work as hard as possible when colleagues can get by slacking doing minimal work
Pros: get to meet some really nice people

Cons: The interview systems of situational-based experiences was honestly stupid. They would rate your answer based on an experience that you had and a lot fo people just learned how to play the game and answer the question (sometimes with something that didn't even happen to them) and they would get promoted over someone that actually deserved the job.
Advice: When I worked there my manager wouldn't allow me to go for different roles, even make lateral moves. I was a top seller at the store and had amazing sales stats. I wasn't allowed to get another leaders permission to apply and they had to do what he wanted for me because he was "my manager." But that really just meant he spent 30 minutes once every 8 weeks in a conversation with me, that made no sense at all.
Pros: Great pay, great benefits, especially for part-timers. I received healthcare and stock options!

Cons: Apple pushes metrics very heavily. So much that it affects the quality of customer service advisors can provide to customers.

Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits for all levels

Cons: I can’t really think of any
Advice: I don’t have any advice
Pros: You get an iPhone so

Cons: Schedule is brutal. Have to use vacation days sometimes just to get weekends off. Some favoritism/accommodations made for employees if they complain about their schedule enough which makes it harder and harder for everyone else just to get time off on the weekends or earlier shifts. Hard to see a long term career in retail management when schedule is so hard to get regular time off with kids or partner.
Advice: Please please please get rid of the Lead job and instead hire more managers. Or, assign the same priveleges to leads on top of comp (such as ability to work remote/vpn provisioning). Its hard to grow and network when the only time you are able to do this is in the store when you can access email/systems, etc, where you are expected to spend much of your time customer facing.

Advice: None
Pros: stable company no layoffs till now

Cons: Two Companies. One Name.



Apple Retail is treated as a separate company even though it's not.

Leadership is concerned with profit, sales, and metrics.



The people don't matter even after the creation of the the "People" organization. Granted - in Apple Retail the leader of Retail is the People department - because that's where most of the employees are.

I'm sure life in Apple Corporate is hunky dory.



Cons for Benefits?

If you needed a vacation in the Retail arena? Boom - we ain't got time for that.

Local Leadership- Oh you don't like to sell things? Let's promote you to customer.
Advice: None
Pros: Pros on Benefits? Most benefits were outstanding. If you wanted a discount on a product? Boom - 25% off one item per grouping. If you wanted to adopt? Excellent, here's some money for that. If you had a transplant? Excellent, have some money for that. If you had health issues? Excellent, here's some time off for that.

Cons: None it’s all real nice
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing company to work for with a-lot of benefits and great work life balance

Cons: Team culture is totally opposite to company culture. Very toxic team environment, never encouraged for cross training and change of responsibility.

People around you working on same things for more than 5 years. If you ask for change in responsibility or cross training manager would decline. Manager expect you to work on same thing every day. You would have no motivation lack of new responsibilities and challenges. 

Very micro managing by manager feels like you are working in store as an hourly employee so you have to answer for every minutes you worked on which task. You need to take permission from your manager for 1:1 with their managers.

You have to include your manager as an optional in all meetings you schedules with your stakeholders so your manager keep an eye on you.
Advice: Please do not make anyone as a manager if person does not qualify for manager without lack of leadership quality or vision. 

No matter how intelligent your employees are without good manager you will not see great result.

Cons: -Stressful - this is a metrics and customer survey-driven role. You will need to assist customers as quickly as possible while ensuring the Apple experience remains intact for the customer. 



-Facade - this is in the minority, but some folks from more senior roles are more interested in keeping appearances and advancement than assisting you. Again this is in the minority, but enough to mention.



-Resources - this company does a fantastic job of pumping out resources to their workers to help with everything from career advancement to personal well-being. However, the resources are spread out over dozens of different sites that could benefit from some considerable consolidation.
Advice: None

Advice: Just be yourself and be friendly. None of the management hates you nor wants to bash on you doing something wrong. They'll help you with everything that you need, all you have to do is ask.
Pros: With the amount of customers that come into the store, you're able to broaden your communication skills by using what you've learned throughout your training and applying to real situations. You learn about different devices that are either recent or new.

Cons: Not many of any at all maybe my 10K Securities book that makes it hard to understand what 2 trillion in cash and 16 billion in company stock has to do with when I get paid. I keep getting transferred to the teachers department?
Advice: Maybe that has something to do with me only after being one of the smartest people in technology whether getting paid does matter only there is little game involved especially working for myself and someone sometimes.

Pros: Good work culture. Hours are on demand

Cons: Wages are nowhere near covering the cost of living.
Higher management does not listen to employees. 
Food insecurity following low wages.
Management sells the vision of our roles being important and impacting people all over the world, yet expects us to live on feeling proud of our work, when it is money, not pride, that pays our bills.
Everyone is soon to be forced back to the office destroying any modicum of having real work/life balance.
CEO and his sycophants pride themselves in breaking barriers yet do not see that their employees are unhappy, that remote work helps in productivity, and would ultimately save the company money.
Advice: Remove Cook and his followers, replace them with someone who actually puts employees needs before investors, after all, it’s employees who create the value, not investors.

Pros: High standard ethics. Doing right by the customer and growth opportunities.

Cons: Can be tiring, wear out employees quickly
Advice: None
Pros: Great company, expects a lot from you

Cons: Compensation is a sore point for every single person on my team and for everyone I talk to on other teams. Business claims to pay the competitive market rate but as people leave in droves we learn they find much higher pay for similar roles across the board elsewhere in the same city. More and more outsourcing taking place to save on paying employees a living wage. A recent “generous” attempt to raise wages and appease people managed to go lower than total inflation this year so was effectively a pay decrease in terms of purchasing power for most people. 

HR plus the outsourced business that does all the paperwork seems to be designed to help Apple rather than the employee. Heard dozens of sad and frustrating first hand experiences from direct co workers about being ignored or made to fill out complex paperwork to het help. I’ve witnessed a few (but not all) managers being confrontational and unprofessional. The public image is far removed from the extremely negative vibe in office exacerbated by the snails pace that the business has in addressing any of this, often with people forgetting all about things before a resolution . 

Offices are colorless, lifeless, dystopian grey/white/silver with a splash of “art” of a phone or computer product here and there, so it makes a fairly miserable place to spend time in. Outside is much nicer but the heat is too much to be out there a lot and there is very limited shade for outdoor seating.

Inflexibility on work from home feels silly after doing it well for 2 years. No real rhyme or reason why some people get to work at home and others to not on the same team.
Advice: Treat employees like humans (not disposable robots), support them, and pay the real market rate. Have better ways to share feedback often from employee and really listen. Overhaul the office culture from top to bottom.
Pros: The stock plan is excellent and the campus services are top notch - medical / dental / gym / vision all on site. Restaurant used to serve great food at reasonable prices and might do again one day (was very reduced post-covid). 401 k match also solid. Facilities are modern and easy to navigate. Leave generous for US companies even if it’s a bit behind some direct competitors.

Pros: Learned a lot Good management Good team Good environment

Advice: None
Pros: - Personable Staff - Learning Opportunities - Supportive Management

Cons: Very under staffed compared to demand of customers.
Advice: Help out and don't stand there when they get behind.
Pros: Good Benefits for the employees

Cons: -Overall direction of new leadership and management. Prioritization of metrics and statistics. Although these stats were always important (they are factored in to determine pay increases), I've noticed newer leadership change how they treat different employees over small changes or minor trends in sales metrics (Applecare,trade-in, accessories,connected).

-Work-life balance is not well for a full-time role. Hours are long and can be tedious, working long is expected and rewarded. For college students, I would've recommended a part time role, but even then the schedule inconsistency and still high commitment would only be for those who can effectively balance the two as equal. I was burnt out and ready for something new after about 2-1/2 years, many will stay for years, some decades.

-You are taught that the Apple experience is about doing what's right for the customer, within the boundaries of what's possible for the company. Often, even a straightforward and legitimate solution (the one our service guide recommends) involves jumping through many hoops to get the customer,leadership,and system to all agree. As a starting specialist, you are the professional hoops jumper, especially at the genius bar.

-Consistent issues with in-store software and hardware, internal tools and services going down, loss of written notes and repair details. Service blackouts are usually minutes but can sometimes last for hours. Daily re-write ups of unsaved repairs or broken repair chains. Extreme lack of production due to these problems, usually amplified by the higher amount of customers we saw at our smaller and less employed store.

Slight anti-union attitude, but no outright call against them. We saw other large stores in cities unionize, I know some of my fellow employees weren't opposed to the idea given the dissent from work-life balance.
Advice: -New management is treating many employees differently, doing favors for them or their customers, or prioritizing them for promotions based on sales statistics. This is something that was trending worse before I left. 

-Solutions are becoming more restrictive, higher cost, almost no room to work with customers and leadership. Often, we are just button pushers on an ipad.

-Recent high turnover at our GB and larger stores unionizing are proof apple retail has changed significantly since reopening post-lockdown.
Pros: -You will work with some fantastic and creative professionals, everyone is kind and very welcoming. The company culture is good, although it can be a bit corny or repetitive at times.

-Excellent benefits and free/discounted Apple services, products etc. Great coverage for insurance and family options available, lots of little company perks. Good stock options, RSUs, occasional bonuses. 

-Competitive/higher than average starting wages for retail space.

-Room to really grow and work your way up in the retail space. Getting promoted/role change is hard work but would pay off well for those looking to lead their team. Many options available for those looking for a career experience at the corporate level after being successful in your current role.

-Great loyalty to and from their employees, although sometimes this means we just 'do whatever corporate thinks we should'. During store closures amid the pandemic apple had all of us work our full hours remotely on collaboration and individual and group projects, great to see them take care of us like that compared to many other retail spaces.

-Genuine joy from helping others often at no cost (depending on hardware/software issue) and repairing trust in Apple's products and services. A personal passion of mine.

-Some new minor benefits and lower schedule requirements for employees coming soon (mostly in response to work life balance issues, see below).

Cons: I believe the leadership team is not organized on the retail level. Communication was lacking.
Advice: Communication within the leadership team on the store level is lacking, which does not instill trust.

- Proper raises were only ever considered after losing 2/3 of our team in under a year
- Being a giant corporation, resolutions to issues come at a trickle
Advice: Management should treat their staff with more (or, in some cases, any) respect. Employees have been told over and over that they aren’t good enough for leadership opportunities unless they move to other stores. Managers are continually demeaning to employees, using gaslighting tactics to try and squeeze anything extra from people eager to prove themselves and move up in a company most of us were excited and hopeful to work for. The least offensive trait I see from management on a regular basis is just laziness; constantly shoving employee needs onto other managers, or refusing to do overrides because we are supposed to be watching how many we do. Respect will go so much further than condescension.

I had to leave the company due to time off policy being changed for part time workers. I had a long trip that I notified management about years before it happened to avoid surprises –– yet, when the policy changed, I didn't find out about it until my time off requests were denied. Even then, I didn't get a straight answer about whether or not I could have the time off and my job when I come back until it was about too late, and then I was fed up.
Advice: Researching and communicating policy for your employees is extremely important in time-sensitive situations.
Pros: Benefits include good healthcare, incentives for health and wellness, free virtual counseling, stock options. Yearly raises were timely. Good company if you like being social. If you are a full time employee, there are programs to start you working at corporate if you wish, and more than a few of my fellow employees began corporate careers through this program.

Cons: i had not find them
Advice: non
Pros: everything was very very good

Cons: Micromanagement is definitely a major con
Advice: Trust your employees
Pros: Discounted product is a benefit

Cons: Non that come on mind with this company
Advice: None
Pros: Environment Culture Friendly Mentors Great experience

Cons: Politics within the buildings are annoying. If you aren't faking it until you make it, you will not get far. You need to absorb everything that management says in order to be considered for a promotion. If you don't, they will overlook you every time. For an atmosphere that emphasizes feedback, the same feedback that you dish out will come back to haunt you down the line.
Advice: It's very hard to work for a company that preaches diversity and inclusion, but having stores with "token" black managers. In a management team of 7-8, there's no reason for there to be one black person on the Leadership team.
Pros: This was a wonderful company to work for when I was looking for a job fresh out of college. The stock options are amazing and the health insurance is amazing. The pay is above normal for retail.

Cons: No cons to note at this time.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company with tons of opportunities for an engineer.

Cons: Although I worked on some interesting projects during my time there, the development timelines were so long that I didn't feel like I got a chance to see any of my design changes implemented into the vehicles. Outside of that, the Michigan cold is definitely a con if you're not from Michigan. Otherwise no real cons.
Advice: None
Pros: I was hired into the TRACK rotational program and my first job was in the CAE group. The leadership was supportive and helped me figure out my career objectives. They also allowed me to work on challenging and high-exposure projects.

Cons: Training and Development: While there are training programs available, some employees feel they are not sufficient or relevant to their career progression.

Work-Life Balance: Although there are flexible work arrangements, some employees still struggle with maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

Resource Allocation: There can be issues with the allocation of resources, with some departments feeling underfunded or understaffed.

Cultural Consistency: The company’s culture can vary significantly between departments and locations, leading to inconsistencies in the employee experience.
Advice: None
Pros: General Motros offers competitive salaries and comprehensive benefits packages

Cons: Senior leadership has been passing down edicts without data to back up the decisions 
We have been through 4 reorgs in the past year
We were forced to return to office while the leadership continued to be filled with fully remote positions
No clear company direction
We were told that we needed to save 2 billion dollars by reducing the workforce and cutting other costs. They said they couldn't afford the Union's demands. Then, as soon as the deal with the union was signed, they announced a $10 billion stock buyback. 
It has become clear that corporate values and company policies only apply to the workforce.
I personally do not like living in southeast Michigan. It's expensive, it's far from any outdoor activities. 

If I have to work for a company that won't include the workforce in decisions and will generally mistreat their workforce, I would at least like to live in a place I enjoy.

Most internal positions that we can apply for are only open to lateral moves, becoming very hard to get any sort of promotion.
Recent raises have not kept up with inflation at all
Advice: Back up your decisions with data. Don't lie to us. If it is just a command, then say that, don't lie and redirect.
Pros: I like my direct managers and coworkers
The pay and benefits are good

Cons: -was on a team where we were changing project every two weeks for a period of 6 months to a year. That meant we learned a lot but were masters of nothing. 
- whole building was laid off after being told there were no more layoffs. So current upper management is not very trustworthy.
- not flexible about remote work
Advice: None
Pros: -got hands on experience on a lot of different technology (Java/springboot angular react etc)
-great people all willing to help 
-if you’re interested in a different career choice they are willing to work with you to find you a spot on a different team that matches your interests
-great benefits and decent bonuses 
-work life balance was excellent 
*this is from the college entry level perspective

Cons: Pay isn't up to level it should be. Depending on team your in your growth and promotions are decided not based on your work. Your work load greatly varies depending on your team. Leadership chases newest coolest trends instead of working on core product and bettering that. California Leadership treats rest of the company as less than them.
Advice: GM should stop chasing and getting apple laid of people they release code to prod once in year.  It doesn't really compare.  You can create bad company at anytime. Just remember the reason people come to GM for reason leverage those instead of swimming with same way.  Long term it will help GM.
Pros: work on devices that people take there families in instead of hold them in there hands. Tech is cool and interesting.

Advice: None
Pros: Work from home good pay

Cons: Chaos management or leadership brought by SLT since end of 2022,
And the forced back to office policy caused center or site couldn't provide enough cubes to fit everyone which means you have to share cubes or use hotel cubes when you back to office. While the policy required 3 days back and 2 days remote still seems working fine but if 5 days back office I can guarantee not a center will have enough workplace for everyone to sit down.
Advice: Direct report basically what I experienced are super nice people, even upper to some senior manager and director level.
But things changed when leadership level up to SLT, GM colleagues knows well recent times.
Pros: Good work life balance
At average or bit higher salary at local area, fair though not very high compare to Bay area, WA, etc;
Besides, direct report basically have good support and co-workers are super friendly and willing to help and listen.
Also provided many resources for self-learning and training programs as well.

Cons: Practical top level competitive decision making
Advice: None
Pros: Good working environment to work

Cons: Complex corporate culture with a lot of bureaucratic hurdles.
Advice: None
Pros: Good experience with managers and good benefits.

Cons: My latter 2 years on the other hand were terrible. Upper management was constantly pressuring our managers to make us work faster all while threatening layoffs and lying about the state of the company. The latter half of my service at GM I did not feel valued at all as an employee and if the same culture persists I would never recommend anyone work there.
Advice: Be more transparent and stop lying about whether layoffs are happening. Value the human beings who are working so hard for your benefit.
Pros: My first year at GM was pretty chill and I was working on interesting projects and was given a lot of room to learn.

Cons: Local union sucks
Management doesn’t care
Hard physical work
Advice: None
Pros: Union benefits are great. Once out of temp status pay is good

Cons: Deadlines are always hard to meet
Advice: None

Cons: Toxic work environment with stack ranking seniors vs new hires

Advice: None
Pros: The work life balance is prioritized in many of the marketing functions. Also, being a larger company, there’s tons of resources during strategy development. You never have to feel like it’s all on you.

Advice: None
Pros: Great place to learn new things as a new graduate

Cons: no cons i can say about
Advice: None
Pros: great company to work for

Cons: Pay increases didn’t keep up with economy. New hires were starting with more than experienced folks. Closed down the AZ site, laying off a lot of people.
Advice: Know your loyal employees worth. Help them grow (including salary). Don’t be a “yes man”  just to make yourself look good.
Pros: Benefits. PTO. Paid holidays. Work environment was chill. Colleagues were great.

Cons: Promotions for most require patience and a big project success.
Advice: Pay attention to communication from direct reports as much as that from your leadership.
Pros: Stable employer through the good times and bad. The company respects employees, highly values safety, and works hard to be a desirable workplace.

Cons: I do not have any Cons.
Advice: I do not have any advice here.
Pros: I really enjoy working at General Motors! The people are great and the work environment and the opportunities are good as well!

Cons: Can be very difficult starting here with no experience as your fate relies solely upon the luck of which team you get placed and how familiar they are with people new in the field
Advice: Learn how to treat people that have no experience in their field. Also for senior management, more transparency would reduce work anxiety by a lot.
Pros: Perfect place to work for experienced people within their field, generally very relaxed environment where you set the precedent for how hard your work will be.

Cons: Not enough benefits compared to software industry
Advice: None
Pros: a great place to work

Cons: So far everything is good
Advice: None
Pros: Good Benefits, Great work-life balance, Hybrid.

Cons: none at this time right now
Advice: None
Pros: Work life Balance
Good Pay for the area

Cons: Roles can be extremely siloed. Becoming an SME in your own area of the business often tunnels the utility you can provide and removes the potential for new skills to be developed. Your skills become less and less transferable if you don't prioritize your own professional development on the business side of the company.
Advice: Reversing the commitments made in recent years such as keeping annual salary raises consistent with inflation and allowing for permanent work from home solutions has created a sense of distrust with senior leadership.
Pros: GM's benefits package, salary commitments, and level of responsibility granted to new employees is unmatched. Especially for students with undecided futures and general business degrees, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to take on managing my own sector of the business in many other companies.

Cons: Senior leadership is inconsistent and outright lies sometimes. Lower pay than other places
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is good. Lots of teams to switch between over time

Cons: No work/life balance. The culture here is horrible. They come up with a new way to lay ppl off every 6 weeks. Everyday at work is like clocking in at the Hunger Games. Avoid this place if possible. Find an employer that actually values you as an employee.
Advice: Why bother? They don't care.
Pros: In this current job market, it's better than being unemployed.

Cons: EV transition has been a disaster.
Advice: None
Pros: Great Pay and solid leadership.

Cons: GM is a more old school company with old school values. They do not hold up to the infrastructure, code quality, or amenities that many software engineers have come to expect. They want to rebrand themselves as a tech company but are a bit lost in how to make that happen.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay (for the area), little to no overtime required (depending on your role), getting to work in a field that is actually newly emerging with lots of potential (EVs), plenty of different areas to work in.

Cons: Dog eat dog culture. Stacked ranking, Mandatory “underperfoeming” ranking of employees
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay, hybrid office requirement

Cons: I don't feel elevated by the talent there. There are some very talented people, but it feels like most of the people are there because they couldn't find any other jobs, and it shows. Additionally, there aren't many growth opportunities.
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, great work life balance.

Cons: “Return to work” policy with no exceptions eliminates or extremely limits opportunities for staying with the company or career growth there if you aren’t near a major office. Attempts at diversity feel performative because they aren’t backed up in practice.
Advice: Actually listen to and follow feedback
Pros: Solid pay and benefits. Good opportunities for growth if you want that but also plenty of roles you can stay in longer term. Good work life balance in most roles.

Cons: You might not get the role you are most interested in
Advice: None
Pros: It is a great way to understand the whole company

Cons: “Return to work” policy with no exceptions eliminates or extremely limits opportunities for staying with the company or career growth there if you aren’t near a major office. Attempts at diversity feel performative because they aren’t backed up in practice.

Cons: You might not get the role you are most interested in
Advice: None
Pros: It is a great way to understand the whole company

Cons: Slow moving and not enough employees
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work on new software

Cons: GM's senior leadership team (SLT) has gone back on their word several times over the past year.

A year and a half ago they said "work appropriately" (which allowed employees and their direct managers to choose when work at home or in office was needed) was here to stay. However, just a few months later, they started requiring us to be in office three days a week. Now, starting January, they are also mandating which of those three days we have to be in office. To make it worse, my whole team is in a different location, so I now have to come in office just to be on Teams calls all day...

Also, there have been multiple times this year the SLT said there would be no layoffs and then proceeded to do layoffs a month or two later. One of these layoffs included closing an entire IT center in Arizona with +900 people.

Through this all, SLT has not acted on feedback from employees or addressed our concerns. Work things the way they are, I would strongly recommend looking somewhere else for a job.
Advice: Listen to employee feedback and let us be where we actually do our best work.
Pros: It really depends on the direct managers you get. If you have good managers then work life balance can be really good and they advocate for you when it comes time for promotions at the end of the year.

The 401k match is also really good and health insurance doesn't cost to much.

Cons: in office working, lack of communication, not strong team

Advice: None
Pros: Laid back environment

Great for resume

Cons: Stressful environment a lot of blame game leadership has no emotional intelligence and not all but a lot of your staff can be difficult to work with depending on the shift and culture at that Plant.
Advice: Stop working your people to death… fix the management vs union mentality. Speak to people better! Include a vehicle in the salary package (like you do for level 8 shift leaders) for group leaders after 18months of service.
Pros: Great pay! You learn a lot and really get to utilize your problem-solving skills if that’s something you enjoy.

Cons: None that I can think of

Cons: Constant re-orgs
Industry that is flailing around trying things (i guess every industry that isn't Generative AI or HW related to Generative AI is flailing right now)
Despite all the rolling layoffs and cuts, there are *still* a core group of people that are just not open to change.
Advice: I don't have a Harvard, or Wharton MBA, and I never worked for a "tech company" as a data scientist or a senior leader ... so why would management listen to anything I say lol? I can't juice the stock price, or magically change the "global competitive landscape and the headwinds we face". I am just here to be as useful as possible till I am inevitably laid off.

- Zero work life balance
- Working 6-7 days a week every week without say and if you don’t come in, you’re fired 
- Have to cover your counterparts when they take PTO in addition to the 70-80 hour work weeks
Advice: Maybe promote individuals who actually do their job instead of working towards being “the most diverse country in America” lol
Pros: Great if you want to work 80+ hours a week and have it be forced lol (non-union employee as a salary supervisor)

-the only requirement for working in vehicle assembly is a pulse, so buyers beware. I'm telling everyone i know to never buy anything manufactured by GM ever,

Advice: None
Pros: Really an amazing place to work at thus far. Great teammates and the leaders I’ve had to work with, created a healthy space to work.

Cons: The only con I can think of is the org changes. Teams swap every couple of months, so just get used to meeting new people. This could also be considered a benefit for making connections.

1) Community: Most engineer here are very friendly and want to help for newbies such as I,

Pros: GM has competitive compensation and benefits. As a large complex company there are opportunities for diverse experiences and specializations.

Cons: Management is mainly a bunch of former sales people and accountants.

The software in the company is literally the worst I've ever seen.

Management doesn't actually understand how modern software development works and just chases fads and plays buzzword bingo. Why? Because they don't actually know what they're doing.

Due to how bad GM is, it's difficult to leave because most companies don't want to hire ex-GM. Terrible rep.
Advice: The senior leadership at GM needs to be replaced and middle management needs to be thoroughly reduced. Too many chiefs and not enough workers.

Advice: None
Pros: Very Personalable work environment and High Mentorship Culture

Cons: The downsides of GM is that it, like most companies, is always changing. Salespeople stay in roles from 6 months to 2 years maximum. Direction from Detroit were always done from their perspective, not realizing that a smaller office has different needs. It was challenging to stay within company guidelines when those guidelines were drawn from farther away.
Advice: The concept of simplification and doing more with less should apply to the people managing, not those DOING.  Having to do one job is enough, being asked to take on 3 different positions is too much.
Pros: Working at GM is like a huge chaotic family reunion; some things are amazing and other times contentious. If you are passionate about cars it is amazing to see the latest innovations and be a part of it. The small office atmosphere for the Sales branches had a feel of a cooperative small office.

Advice: None
Pros: Great pay, good room for advancement!

Cons: So many meetings to attend
Advice: None
Pros: Great work place. Great pay

Cons: I happened to land in a not so great org in IT and had some really horrible managers during my time there. One especially would bully her team members until enough of a pattern was established that people started reporting her to HR. She seemed to be friends with a higher up manager and only got moved around until she finally left the company to wreak havoc elsewhere. I also had an developer friend on a different team that got bullied out until she quit. The automotive industry tends to have layoffs pretty often even in good times, and very often during the year that UAW contracts need to be renegotiated. The performance review structure has changed recently to include more feedback from your manager every quarter. I would say GM is a better option for business backgrounds than software developers. And college hires tend to get promoted more than individual contributors due to their raise structure. I feel my skills stagnated during my time there, but some have done well, YMMV. And those I know who have left, usually make more $$$ elsewhere.
Advice: Assume goodness, what a crock.
Pros: It's a very good company for those just starting out in their careers since they tend to hire a lot of new college graduates and cater to their training and development. Depending on what area you get into, and your management, your experience can vary widely. They do have a very generous parental/family leave policy, just implemented in the past few years. They also have a very generous tuition reimbursement program. Once established, there are opportunities to apply for international assignments.

Advice: It was said during the end of year speech, at GM motorsports  "We are a family and the foundation of a family is built on trust" During the interview I was told lies about this position. Thus my "relationship", with my new family was founded on lies. Management should be proud they have created such a "knives in back", extremes politics and potentially life wrecking environment for employees. You need to change the unethical people in leadership of GM motorsports software. Lastly, it also very telling of how this team is managed when you are on your 7th PO/PM in 3 years....

Cons: Senior Leadership has been trying to hire in the right person to change the trajectory of the company on the IT and strategy side. They hired a strategy guy - a few reorgs, but no noticeable changes. They hired a digital product guy from pixar - a few reorgs, no noticeable changes. Now they hire an Apple guy who so far has only been working to bring in people he knows from silicon valley. He appears to not really have a plan other than using this experience as an internship to learn from Mary Barra. Expected result - a few reorgs, no noticeable changes.
Advice: With a company as old and storied as GM you cannot hire a visionary to dramatically change everything. They are met with too much resistance - often from within the C Suite itself. Inertia is real and when you try to fabricate change faster than the organization can absorb it you usually degrade the culture with few if any measurable improvements to the bottom line. If you want rapid change - spin things off like Cruise and Brightdrop. Let those things incubate outside of the womb that is still really just trying to build cars and put them on dealer lots. Otherwise the collateral damage of trying to inject change could actually erode the core, and sacrifice the culture that has been hard won over the past decade.

With that vagueness, many don't have a good goal post to work towards and seem to languish while a few work way to hard to push the product through the machine.
Advice: Invest in your technical leaders more and silicone valley less.
Pros: Some really cutting edge stuff to work on with room to collaborate and invent.  Rewarding in positions I have had to be close to the final product and drive what you worked on.  There are some really smart people here, and if you align with them there is a lot to learn.

Cons: Like any large company, there are some frustrations when it comes to big initiatives being rolled out. The pendulum can swing widely from one direction to another.
Advice: Suggestion would be to hold managers, execs, and sr. execs more accountable.  If a large initiative, program, etc. is not successful, make sure the feedback gets to them and if not corrected, promote up and comers who are more nimble and can get the job done.
Pros: GM has some of the best people to learn from. Everyone is extremely helpful and wants you to be successful. There are also numerous career opportunities and different parts of the business that you can learn and you're encouraged to do so.

Cons: Very in depth knowledge you must learn
Advice: None
Pros: Fantastic team to work with

Cons: 1.People leaders within the SW space need to be reduced to enable rapid collaboration.They just get in the way of workflow more than helping, coming up with processes for the sake of it. The few that try to collaborate at the working level get easily flustered but having said this there is no doubt there is year over year changes in people leaders that is going in the right direction. 2.In house SW development quality is very poor to put it nicely. 3.Infotainment design and execution is several years behind competitors , needs a complete overhaul fastest option of it being paying suppliers for the next few years to get closer to competition than trying to do it ourselves

This is the single biggest reason for things not falling apart 2.Decent pay ,a good benefits package. 3.A lot of new employees replacing old hands that left are doing well to cover them when provided with the right guidance and the freedom to go about their way to get work done. 4.Mary and the executive leadership are doing their best and to march towards business goals.Its Good to see executives genuinely try.

Pros: Some coworkers at gm make it easier to stay.

Cons: GM is plagued by too much mid-management creating fiefdoms and uncooperative behaviors. The executive level mgmt has vision but can't seem to carry it out and decommits too early. Their products are middling and poorly conceived with lots of obvious mistakes making it through production.
Advice: GM needs a complete reboot (unfortunately the bankruptcy didn't achieve enough). The culture is poisoned and despite layoffs and early retirement offers there are still far too many people getting in the way rather than adding to the cause.
Pros: Great compensation keeps people around for long careers. Lots of potential, huge market of captive consumers begging them for new products.

Cons: slow moving large company with all the issues that come along with that
Advice: None
Pros: generous bonus structure and benefits packages.

Cons: Job insecurity: during a lay-off round, sleep is a four letter word Labor is a a commodity: You're on your own. Don't get comfortable with the chair you sit in. You'll move before it's warm. Sometimes you'll move as a team, other times you'll move on your own. High expectations: Expectations aren't always expressed. You have to learn through the grapevines and they mess with your work-life balance. Example: if they give you a cell phone (pretty much standard now) it's expected to be on you pretty much 24/7 and it's not for private use. I used it as such anyway though, because I'm not going to carry around two phones. Another one: at a level 7 you're pretty much expected to work all the time. Not doing that precludes you from moving up the ladder, because it's a rat race. I recommend it, because in comparison to other US employers, GM is pretty good.
Advice: Barra has done great work, but management needs to come off their high horse and start to live what they preach about the GM family. That should be more than saving cash-back points for oil changes and accessories.

Pros: it's a great team in the body shop area and the work is very engaging and hands on

Cons: The SR system has gotten a lot better, but a lot of the work can be a series of requests and approvals you have to account for in planning. Something you cant really get away from in a company this big, but its always a risk in planning. Leadership is all over the place about layoffs and layoffs. Most the employees think its sketchy. Only main con is compensation for those who do more than others. I get inflation is a thing now so you have to hire new college hires and experienced hires for more, but those who have been here through the thick and thin are also impacted by inflation. New college hires coming in close to level 7s in terms of salary is a slap in the face when you dont plan on giving us any sort of adjustment.
Advice: None
Pros: Started here out of college and worked my way up to a mid-senior level 7. I think your experience here is mainly impacted on where you land in terms of space/org and manager. I personally loved my experience and the opportunity to grow where you are or move laterally is there. My managers have always been supportive and cared about how I was. Just depends if you decided to outshine others or not. Also an easy place to coast if you are looking for something of that nature. Work life balance has always been awesome. Management has always been flexible for me. Unless you are a slacker, annual raises were always 3-4% maybe more. Bonuses are up and down, but last few years have been good. PTO and Holidays are awesome because of the factory shut downs.

Cons: Fast paced, a lot of programs to manage at once
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay and benefits, I appreciate the flexibility of my day to day.

Cons: - Pay is lower than essentially every tech company, GM will claim they want a tech presence but will always be a corporate car company first. By this I mean at a certain point the only way to make career progress is to go management route and climb through endless ranks of management. - GM invests a lot into new hires and as a result has a lot of turnover after 2 years (New hires have to pay back relocation) - Not a lot of senior talent here.
Advice: Attracting and retaining senior talent would provide financial rewards in both the sort and long run. More technical leadership leads to higher reliability / efficiency and less buggy code bases. Its more expensive to rebuild a system several times than to build a system with the experience of forsight.
Pros: - As a senior you are able to hop on more impactful teams since there is a lack of senior talent. - Job security used to be more certain but after layoffs this pro may have shifted. - Work life balance varies, a lot of college new hires like to work weekends and work late to prove themselves but this culture is not expected. It really just depends on the team.

Cons: None, GM is not a perfect place, but they are working very hard to become one.
Advice: None to share at this time.

Cons: -Extremely stressful work environment. Everything is done last minute, no one knows who is responsible for what, and everyone is over-worked. Everything is thrown together and assigned to you at the very last minute, despite management knowing about projects months ahead of time. Pure chaos.

 

 -High turnover rate means that people are shoved into roles and there is a lack of continuity. New tasks outside of your responsibility will be assigned to you without even asking. It's hard to keep up with who is in charge of what because it changes so often.

 

 -Insufficient, disorganized, and informal training of new hires. You must constantly hunt people down to try get trained on programs and processes that are essential for you to do your job effectively. It is hard to find people willing to show you things. Management tells you to just figure it out because that's what they had to do.

 

 -Management is not open to constructive comments about process improvement. When you question the processes in place, they will tell you that "that's just how things are" and gaslight you for questioning them.

 

 -The work culture is very fictitious. They will talk about inclusion and diversity. They will send e-mails about mental health. But in reality, they promote only a certain type of people, and the high-stress work environment and lack of any structure make it difficult to maintain your mental health.

 

 -There is very little teamwork. It's every man for themselves. 

 

 -Unreasonable workload. You will be expected to juggle upwards of 20 projects at a time. Management loses track of what you are working on, so they will just assign more and more. They will not ask you if you can take on new projects, they will just forward them to you. You will receive so many big complicated projects with extremely tight deadlines that you will have a panic attack each time you get a new e-mail from certain people.

 

 -Lack of job security: the company is infamous for hiring people on contract. They want to test you out. They will string you along with the vague idea that you will eventually be hired on permanently. You will receive no health benefits and you will be excluded from additional perks such as public transit allowances. You will feel like you are not a true employee, but instead, a lower class within the workplace.

 

 -Zero transparency with staff. Management makes many "strategic" choices behind closed doors. There is always a lot of whispering and secret conversations. Everything always felt very sneaky.
Advice: -Provide formal and standardized training, tools, and resources to your employees upon hire.

 

 -Senior managers need to closely monitor middle management to ensure that their staff is happy and well-equipped with proper resources and knowledge.

 

 -Be transparent with your employees.

 

 -Recognize the hard work of your employees and thank them regularly.

 

 -Truly listen to your employee's concerns and work with them to find a solution. Do not just tell them to "figure it out" or that "that's just the way things are here".

 

 -Ensure that workloads are reasonable.
Pros: -Summer Fridays = finishing at 12:30 every Friday in summer

Cons: People at L'Oréal need to fit a certain mold :show-off, tell the boss he is great even if you think the opposite, laugh to jokes that are not funny and use the same expressions as everyone just like sheep, try to look just like every other employee in the company. If you do not fit that mold and if you express critical thinking towards that mold, beware : you will be pointed out as... weird.

You are told during your internship that if you have an excellent evaluation in the end, you will get hired. That is a big fat lie to squeeze the juice out of you at a low price (interns are paid much less than employees of course). The people who get hired at L'Oréal are not the best but the ones who perfectly fit the mold described in the 1st paragraph. And they say they are all about diversity...

Instead of hiring, L'Oréal relies on (cheap) interns. They are asked to take important responsabilities and commit fully to their job, but are not informed of major decisions (that they need to know to do their job correctly).
Advice: You won't get anything good out of your employees if they don't have the power to criticize.

Be honest with your interns from the start : they choose to come to L'Oréal because you promise to hire them if they deliver excellent work. If you can't keep that promise (and know you won't), I don't know what to say about your ethics.
Pros: Good salary, products for free

Leadership and responsabilites on projects

Advice: a) Be more inclusive and walk your talk with regards being diverse and inclusive. b) Respect people's work-life balance and not make people work 60 hours per week with no overtime payment..

Cons: Bad Management that covers each other when they do wrong things. What you see, is not what it is. Never judge the book by its cover. Management are can able to take leave without applying on the system and drown the employee at work. Worksmart suppose to be once a week but was violated to take several times without people knowing. Management are able to watch drama and throw all the works to employee and credit themselves. Best is you can actually get your position if you have connection or ‘bribery’. Efforts will be credited to those who are not working. Is a good place for management level but bad place for employees. The turnover rate is super high that there is overlapping things not done or follow up by the previous employees. Guess how unhappy that the ex employee is. Most of all flavourism take place and drown the work to the unflavored ones which cost unstable feeling. Only good feedback are allow to show and hides the bad ones. If you could accept bad feedback there will be many who will willing to write over here. No one wants to leave for a good company but they leave because of bad managements. If you need to survive in L’Oreal you need to learn to be fake and be a ‘Yes’ man.

Cons: If you want to learn the art of politics this is the place.

It’s full of people with big egos especially management at the top. If you’re not French or French speaking/understanding at least, your chances of climbing up is pretty much zero.

During meetings French management Are incredibly rude. We had a big meeting once and junior staff were explaining things and the bosses suddenly talked to each other in french and then laughed and said we made a decision and it’s bla bla. I mean how rude and condisending?



Who you know in the company and if you’re likeable also matters hugely. When you start out in the company your pretty much are expected to schmooze and build fake relationships. If you’re good enough at playing the game, you’ll go up.



Decisions can change in an instant and all your hard work is wasted without an explanation.



They also force you to come back to office even during the COVID outbreak saying it’s the culture of L’Oréal and you can build connections better bla bla. But the reality was that work was going on perfectly fine and things were getting done.

HR is pretty useless in this company and I feel a lack of humanity and empathy.

Advice: None
Pros: Entrepreneurship and freedom within your job responsibilities

Cons: Too many HR layers yet everything is contracted to different companies

So many people recruiting, not done locally to meet mgt needs of the facility

Wellness benefits--hard to participate, too many caveats

Expectations to be in early/stay late 

Over 40 yrs old,  no room for advancement

Horrible IT systems because of our business processes 

Any challenge to an idea is regarded as 'actively disengaged' so employees must just smile and agree to the company line.
Advice: Come and see how complicated and exception laden process is.  See what it takes to create, receive and close a purchase order,  track information or just try to get a printer at closer to your desk! 



If you wonder why it takes so long to (fill in the blank to what you want), start looking at the details on why it takes so long.  Remember, 

*you lack standardized business processes

*if you do have standardized business process, pretty much every situation is an exception to the    process

*each division does things differently and everyone has good reasons why we can't

*we have to always meet with everyone 3x's and publish meeting notes before we can officially formulate a plan to expedite your request

*we have to have some more mandatory team training so we all can learn to get along



I don't know what has happened to L'Oreal in the last 4 or 5 years. This is not the same company I remember.
Pros: Company Store benefits

Medical benefits superior and relatively low cost

At local level, mgt does try to create a positive culture and show appreciation

Cons: The higher up you go, the more politics. Some teams (especially in the headquarters) are not country-centric and too much of the same profile - almost 80% of a function's committee can be all French, who have not been outside of Europe for their careers.  Harder for Asians it seems to have the same career track until a certain point in their career, then it becomes all Europeans in the post. Ethics is a campaign, but I am not sure it is embodied by everyone - especially by some leaders. Average compensation and benefits, nothing exciting.
Advice: Diversity in leadership - please commit to this and not just give the answer "we are still developing leaders in these zones." In bigger countries, the notion of being seen as an individual who can make an impact is lost - I felt this more when I worked in smaller teams.
Pros: Responsibility at a young age, and it's true that there's a lot of possibilities - you just have to remain focused on how you want to grow. Good international career in selected fields (in other functions, there may be lots of competition hence the notion that it's harder to go international). Able to handle projects that have an impact - it's true what they say, it's sometimes all up to you how you want to shape your job role and what kind of projects you want to have as your legacy. Work life balance has improved. Very strong L'Oreal culture passed on from older generations.

Cons: While you know you have Job security, if you're black that's all you have.

I work in their retail sector at one of the malls in South Africa, growth is limited, there are extreme limitations for a black/African to get a promotion if one has aspirations to work at the head offices. In the years I've spent working for them, I have observed that non-black individuals such as Indians and Whites no matter how less qualified they may be get opportunities compared to blacks, Black people are usually kept in the same position for years with no growth, like every other corporate you have to train the unqualified seniors that join the team. During this pandemic policies that apply to staff at HQ do not seem to apply at the retail level, HR is run by managers. safety precautions such as masks are not provided while HQ staff work from home and the go to the extent of pregnant retail staff keep going to work in high-risk zones. They would rather delegate responsibilities of a role that needs to be filled to existing staff than to hire or promote someone. Working hours are sometimes unrealistic especially in a pandemic when they don't consider the curfew. The management style is "Fear and intimidation" and they can go to the extent of making working conditions so difficult that they eventually resign. It's extremely toxic



As you read this you might think this is another rant about race but this is the truth. When you ignore all the other factors stated, I enjoy my job but the moment Interact with HQ management it takes the fun and drains everyone in the team.

Advice: None
Pros: Big company, bonus, global company, good environment, pride

Cons: 1. Hard to sell comparing other competitor Make-up Brand in industry.

2. Their Sales Manager of Shu Uemura is VERY RUDE and NON-CARING at all for the staffs! She only concerned about the sales target and can simply ignore your Annual Leave request (For example, "If you didn't hit your sales target this month/overhit your sales target, I won't approve your annual leave" - Even the Counter Manager approved it.

3. Too expensive! Other brands like M.A.C, Bobbi Brown are cheaper than Shu Uemura but with stunning result too.

4. The style and creativity side is not there, since is the Japanese Make-up Brand why all staff must wear an uniform but not do their own style to attract customer? (For example, M.A.C or Bobbi Brown dress whatever they like as long as is black, with stylish hair too - it makes you look professional and look like Stylist/Make-up Artist, comparing Shu Uemura it looks so far boring.)
Advice: 1. Change your attitude and be caring to your staff! Sales is a must but that doesn't mean you can use that to blackmail your staff by not giving them annual leave.

2. Bring your brand high profile! Shu Uemura is lack of promotion and PR.

3. Change the style! Let people see and get attract by your brand or your Stylist/Make-up Artist.

4. Negotiate your price! Everyone can found a similiar product with better value.

Advice: None
Pros: Good culture and people are ok good

Cons: Not a place to work if you are looking to develop a career... 

Takes forever for a promotion (general speaking)

Many "Senior" level positions have been eliminated - leaves nothing to work towards

Management less than competent and very old school - afraid to think outside the box

Communication is sub par for a company this size and age

Raise is pretty much non existent and bonus is "profit sharing" and not based o performance

Top down corporate culture

Culture not conducive to someone that is forward thinking, risk taker, innovator (outside of R&D and product development) 

Education Assistance is dependent on what manager thinks of you - if they don't like you forget about getting assistance

Narrow minded - have been told by many people on many levels that marketing is hard to get into and they only take Ivy league or top 25 business school graduates

Diversity they rave about is not apparent - 

and the list goes on... if you want a career - don't work here...
Advice: Take a survey of your employees and find out who is truly happy and how effective management really is... Work on developing loyalty to employee - recognize and develop talent when you have it - implement continuous training and education for management -
Pros: Benefits are great - company store option, free goods, good bags on holidays and events, philanthropy and humanitarian work - some of the people are really nice- holiday schedule and summer hours that run from mid May to mid September

Cons: Not a con per se, but it is fast-paced (as with all FMCGs).

Also, in such a big company with more than 20 brands, there is still a tendency for some to operate in silo.
Advice: Keep doing what you're doing, as long as the company keeps its vision and its heart for consumers and employees, the results will definitely show
Pros: As someone passionate in the role and the industry, I love that the work is challenging and fulfilling - you will learn new things, drive projects, develop your skills in the ever-changing landscape, and have a chance to make an impact. 



Beyond that, the company is genuine in its desire to constantly provide good environment and care for employees. 

I had heard negative things before joining the company, but after being here for some time, I think that is a thing of the past. 

The management has changed, the culture has evolved, there is a real effort to drive employee engagement, and the benefits such as flexibility to work-from-home sweeten the experience. 

I also greatly appreciate that the company is socially and environmentally conscious.

Cons: not many cons to write about
Advice: None
Pros: great people and an awesome brand

Cons: As opposed to what I thought before coming into the company L'Oréal is run separately for their four business units (Luxury, Professional, Active Cosmetics & Consumer). They have a strange culture that doesn't allow them to fully leverage on the company's name. They like having things run the L'Oréal way and are not open to any new ideas or changes that threatens this.



Teamwork doesn't exist if you are a newcomer to the company. You will find yourself dealing with people that have many years in the company and who don't like "strangers" with weird ideas. 



No open culture to talk about problems within teams. If you say something is wrong in a meeting you'll get buried. The culture of the company is to cover your back first and then point towards someone else to blame.



REALLY , REALLY, REALLY DISORGANIZED company. This is one thing Loreal is very proud of because they love to say they are a cellular company as opossed to a process driven company such as the American ones. They hate being told that it urges to have a process and basically everything comes down to just telling the ones you like on your team what you are going to do and the rest of the people doesn´t matter. 



GOSSIP EVERYWHERE



Really bad HR team



COUNTLESS HOURS OF WORK, FORGET ABOUT WORKLIFE BALANCE. 



CONSTANTLY REDOING THINGS. ENDLESS LOOP OF NOT GETTING THING DONE AND REPLANING AGAIN, AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH NO TIME TO EXECUTE.
Advice: Be open to change and have a more welcoming environment. If you want to succeed in this era, you can no longer behave like a dinosaur.
Pros: Employee discount to buy products.

Cons: Not very nice to foreign workers by not allowing them to work from their home country during Covid quarantine
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits and nice office.

A lot of training

Cons: extremely catty work environment, no work-life balanace.
Advice: None
Pros: you get to try products.

Cons: L'Oréal Denmark is by far the worst employer I  ever faced. I would not recommend this company to anybody.



- Absurdly long working hours. I routinely worked 9-20. On peak times it was even worse (late night & weekend work).



- No recognition for your hard work: managers rotate country/department frequently, and their only concern is to as much performance as possible during their assignment, with complete disregard of employees job satisfaction



- Strong blame culture: managers are put under very high pressure from HQ, and instead of trying to collaborate in order to solve issues, they look for somebody to blame so that they don't get in trouble



- Salary is relatively low, especially in consideration of the high workload



- HR is utterly useless and unprofessional: many co-workers of mine were feeling miserable because of the poor working conditions. HR and Managers provided no support whatsoever, leading them to feel even more hopeless



- Total lack of structure and process thinking: lots of non-value adding and boring tasks that have to be done only to please HQ in Paris



- The high turnover rate is indicative of the level of dissatisfaction that many employees exhibit
Advice: Treat your employees like human beings and not like robots that are sitting there just to produce. Having people who feel valued and considered would benefit the company in the long term.



Working hours are too high. People burn out soon and leave the company, taking away their experience and know-how. I believe it is in the interest of the firm to prevent this.
Pros: Young and international work environment. 

This is primarily due to the fact that locals (danish speakers) can find better jobs in other firms

Cons: Some responsibilities should be conducted by agencies instead of the role's owner

Advice: None
Pros: Possibilities to propose innovative projects
Great team competency in IT and Business

Cons: Old fashioned processes, French culture
Advice: None
Pros: Interesting brands, fast paced culture

Cons: - Most reviews on Glassdoor have been forced to be written by the HR. I was asked to write one personally earlier too. 



- Half our campus didn’t apply because they were turned off by the attitude and sarcastic and mean nature of the HR 



- If you approach the HR for any issue while working there, the blame will be put on you and you’ll be reprimanded



- Interview was filled with sarcastic jibes and personal remarks 



- Small office 



- Very different work timings, work and ‘chill’ atmosphere from what HR claimed on campus
Advice: Be what you claim to be or don’t claim to be something else. Please don’t be so rude and sarcastic to students publicly for no reason. Your HR represents your company outside your office, please choose one who doesn’t ruin your company’s image. Our entire college has a very low opinion of your company simply because of how the HR behaved with the students. 



Your company is great. Your campus HR is not. And that ruins everything.
Pros: Well the people are pretty like minded. So if you are a certain type of person, you won’t get a more like minded bunch anywhere else. 



Very open minded people with few restrictions on clothing etc. it’s very freeing.

Cons: Same objectives with a good vibe at work

Pros: Digital, Beauty, Ecom, Global, 360 Marketing

Cons: Bad company culture and senior management. Not a cohesive environment to work in.
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits and product allowances. Good bonuses.

Cons: It's just a pity you can't rate zero stars...

They develop L'Oreal interns and grads that ultimately move up very quickly resulting in people in high profile roles that don't have any experience of working elsewhere, and know no better than the norm which is an awful, toxic culture and rubbish short term turnover strategy. 

Development within the company is based on who you know and networking, and not at all on your skills or accomplishments. 

Hours are 9-5 but comments will be made multiple times if you don't work above these, it's all about working hard at L'Oreall, and not smart. People stay until 8pm watching Match of the Day on their screens to be seen to be staying late, and being promoted as a result. Who has time to compete with that? It's 2020 God damn.

"Feedback" is massively encouraged through trainings but I've never met a worse bunch in giving it, and receiving it. HR are absolutely nowhere to be seen, apart from with management, which is a red flag in itself.
Advice: Focus on sell out strategies and rework targets to drive this, which will ultimately drive the sell in; short term pain for long term gain etc.

Last but not least, stop plugging important issues like work life balance, ethics etc until the company makes a change, it is massively disingenuous and a lot has to change before celebrating /plugging these issues is remotely acceptable.
Pros: Free products, occasional charity and staff sales. Nice canteen and the company that run it make an exceptional effort to provide variety which doesnt go unnoticed.

Cons: weak communications among people and full time hours of service
Advice: None
Pros: good environment and teamwork and good products

Cons: Increment and promotion is very less
Advice: None

Cons: they are not fair in terms of salaries and promotions especially their out of the US factories.
Advice: None
Pros: you get to have almost 50-90% discount on their products

Cons: Very hierarchical 

Low- Paid, number one complaint from all the colleagues in my team of 8 people - versus other FMCG

Bad working / life balance despite all the good efforts from HR

Heavier workload in supply chain than other departments - you ll finish at 8 pm very often and later on days of monthly transmission or KPIs reporting 

No time for analysis as operational workload is so high, many SKUs to manage, reports and inefficient processes (but it gets better)

Under- staffed

Stressful working environment 

You need to be determined, persistent and fight for your rights or you will be eaten alive

Networking counts - other divisions, departments  or other subsidiaries: you need to find time to socialize and tie lies 

Change of management every 3 years as per L'oreal policy which disrupts the flow
Advice: More staff and people's rotation in order to decrease such high turnover
Pros: People are passionate about the brands, talented and friendly 

Staff sales every 2 months on all the products (about 4000 SKUs) 

Annual Incentive trip to amazing destinations 

Very good school:  processes, reporting but you need to catch fast and learn to work on stress management and priorities 

Friendly corporate culture: launch events, annual results, citizen's day, farewell etc...

Incentive to take time on working hours for social responsible activities in the community organized by the company 

Possibilities to move to another department, division or subsidiary if good ties and recommendation from your manager

Cons: Low salary

No extras at all
Advice: None
Pros: People, interst, processes, success, like a family

Cons: Not enough level of average salary
Advice: None
Pros: Best company in the world

Cons: incentives are low need to improve
Advice: offer good incentive please
Pros: Offer good salary and expenses

Cons: - Roles to upgrade into are limited.
Advice: None
Pros: - Work environment is very positive.

Cons: Caliber of talent is not so high specially across Mid Levels & Juniors however a lot of work is being put to elevate the talent level across the organisation.
Advice: None
Pros: I joined L'Oreal in Beirut 2 month back in a Mid Level Managerial Position. I had worked previously in 2 other multinational FMCG companies for more than 8 years.



Prior and during my joining period, the L'Oreal HR team have made my recruitment and on-boarding very smooth, pleasant and fast. My On-Boarding plan was prepared for me prior to joining, as of my first week I had completed most of my inductions and met/ interacted with all supporting functions . 

The HR department also shared with me a clear overview on the company and welcomed me with a gift bag as a welcoming gesture. 



I quickly felt part of the team and part of the mission to turnaround my division.



My Manager, who was newly assigned to her role, was supportive and made sure to enable me when I needed and empowered me along the way.



Overall, the culture is nice, a lot of young people. I mostly interacted with my division, in which I believe the culture is quite great.



Benefits and salaries are adequate compared to multinationals in Lebanon, however in reward and recognition they are quiet generous.



A lot of support on Learning and Development from the L&D team , HR and leadership team.

Cons: The culture is really bad. People scream and curse to each other on meetings and one have no autonomy, even in higher roles such as directors, as you need to do as you're told so. People work from 8h to 23h and that seems normal and expected. If you are a fresh undergrad and really competitive, it can be a great fit. However, if you have family, especially kids, it can be really tough. I suffered psychological harassment from direct management and when searched for help, HR said this person had already made it several times before, but when confronted last time, she said she was going to change. HR confessed having no authority to do anything. So I left and even so, had to hear that "I was going to lose the job of my dreams and I would regret for the rest of my life, and they wouldn't accept me back when I come running asking for my job again". I didn't.
Advice: None
Pros: Besides the great brands and lovely products, the people there is trying their best to thrive on a fast paced company with no guidelines, no clear processes and mostly top-down policy. There is a lot of benefits, such as extra paid time off, free courses and free products (although in my country there's no way to buy what you want with discount. Forget about it!).

Cons: Very high paced environment, requires being on top of the work all the time.

Advice: None
Pros: The remuneration and atmosphere is really good

Cons: hight performance expectation, low support to achieve this
Advice: None
Pros: benefits, good environment to work

Cons: Workload is heavy, and working over the weekend is quite common. 

Rapid career advancement becomes a double edged sword, as once mid level management role is reached, the organisation generally lacks role models for senior management role models to learn after. 

Processes are manual and time consuming, alot of time is wasted on paperwork

Limited structure in place, a newcomer need to make alot of effort to learn the ropes

As everyone is much occupied, on the job mentoring by senior colleagues are uncommon

Expatriation is uncommon, and even if there is, opportunities are usually given to Marketing personnel first
Advice: Seriously consider how to keep your talents that worked in the company for more than 3 years.
Pros: Possible rapid career advancement, very good for young executives who want to climb the coporate ladder fast. 

Adequate training given to individual, about 72 hours per year on average? And the quality of training is usually satisfactory

Fair company benefits, especially transport allowance for sales staff, and medical claim coverage

The organisation treasures instinct & creativity. Autonomy at your job is usually a given

Company gives real responsibilites to new comers quickly, all staff will "get into the action" within 1st month on the job

Communication from top down is usually transparent 

As the environment is tough, bonding between colleagues are usually good and last for a long time

Cons: Very fast paced around product launches. Office politics a must to work your way around issues. Guidance is vague many times, must be able to 'figure it out'. A tough culture for newbies, takes a while getting used to, getting the means to do your job, knowing who does what. Standards of execution are not set straight to entire teams, it's a company that allows each employee to fill objectives in the way they see fit - this has it's pros and cons. High employee rotation. Recognition is achieved by not only doing excellent work, but also by being able to show it off in the right way.
Advice: Clearer guidance and more proximity to all levels of the organization. Stronger compensation.
Pros: L'Oreal is the big entrance to the cosmetics industry. Gives knowledge and insight, allows you to work as the market leader with the retailers. Informal and fun corporate culture. Provides opportunity of responsabilty and execution to anyone - there is much to be done and job descriptions are vague. Extending one's influence is up to you. A great start to a career, after a few years at L'Oreal you are an asset to many companies. A passionate industry to work in, innovative. Allows exposure to top management and to influencing directly the results of a product launch very soon in one's career.

Cons: - Malaysia HR managers in long tenure are too political and can sometimes seem unethical in behaviour and remarks. 
- A lot of people agenda needs to be driven by business leaders on their own will poor support from HR. No clear intent on people agenda. Which results in turnover of people. 
- Work scope can overlap at times which creates unnecessary complications. 
- Long hours but it is individual choice due to flexible working style and not forced by company
Advice: - Look into stronger HR leaders as many other markets in region have advanced
- Continue driving transparency in managing situations. 
- Ensure right and proper roll out of new culture project
Pros: - Dynamic business - beauty is ever growing and fuelled by innovation and advancement of digital space - which the company is leveraging well on. 
- Open culture - matrix structure which means individuals don't need to push for visibility. 
- Stable industry and business. Constantly growing ahead of industry pace for the past few years. Lots of potential in Malaysia market. 
- Great Brands and vision - very clear ambition by group and local in terms of business. 
- Great career progression if performance and potential. Inspiring to see peers exported to other markets as well as exposure received. 
- Lots of room to drive and bring changes. Senior management on business side always open to new ideas.

Great benefits 

Growth program is excellent

Cons: huge amount of workload and bad worklife balance
Advice: None
Pros: Enthusiastic team and very collaborative

Cons: Very closed in some aspects
Advice: None
Pros: Opportunities to go international with lots of privileges

Cons: Long hours for full time employees, especially in Marketing.  I see people working very late into the evening, even weekends, with no overtime whatsoever.  Lots of people get stressed out when International people come for visits.  The cafeteria charged high prices for some of the food items.  Lots of gossiping inter-departmental which I did not like much.  Promotions did not always seem to be based on performance as office politics do play a part in the whole ordeal.  Lots of turnovers in the company as those who have worked 2 or 3 years can now get better jobs with higher pay.
Advice: Rid of office politics and offer more productive feedback.
Pros: Discounts on products; inside coffee house; plasma TV to watch games during World Cup, clean/fashionable work environment, great open space.... LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!! Right in the middle of StCatherine and University, it is probably the best location in my humble opinion for a company to have.  On top of the Eaton Center, and within walking distance of all amenities, I could not ask for more.  During the summer, it is very nice as you can get out of the office and go for a nice leisurely stroll downtown and still be back for work in the afternoon.  Very nice view from the office as well.

Cons: This king of job could be paid
Advice: None
Pros: Various tasks that you choose yourself



Constant feedback



Learning opportunities

Cons: High pressure work environment and long days.
Advice: None
Pros: Fast learning curve, a lot of responsibility for junior employees and opportunities to develop.

Cons: messy internal operation , no clear roadmap and direction can make you feel unsure and confuse, weak sales network & over-depend on marketing to deliver results , lack clear & long term vision & big pisture perspective , do not synergize & pool resources efficiently between division / brands / channel , do not emphasis effiency at organization & personal level ,  poor fanancial reporting accuracy , weak supply chain management , poor internal communication , promotions criterias questionable , demoralized work force , do not bring 'play hard' culture to actual working , people lack solid industry experience , too much app;e-polishing culture , has some weird & rigid processes
Advice: be more agressive, serious and fast in addressing weakness
Pros: strong international brands that are widely recognixed , exposure to european company to motivate you to learn about new culture & language , staff purhase , ocassional freebies treat , good health benefit , recognize need for change , open culture ,  high standards in brand communication , strong technology & R&D behind products , representation in many business sectors within cosmetic & beauty hence a true expert , young & energitic hence you could say less politic depends on how you see it , opportunity to develop career in different divisions which could mean a richer work experience ,  fast promotion

Cons: not very good in decision making
Advice: in many things such as decision making
Pros: very big stucture in many countries

Cons: poor work environment poor management high work load
Advice: None
Pros: nice aesthetics. freebies training opportunities

Cons: 1.) I wouldn't call it a con but you must be willing to work hard - it is not an einvorment that is friendly to people who aren't willing to put in their fair share.
Advice: None
Pros: 1.) Responsibiliy - whether it be doing analysis for crucial meetings, or managing my own projects, the level of discretion given to even junior levels is impressive. I have found myself creating assets for pivotal internal/external meetings, and also managing several of my own projects.



2.) Work-environment - as long as you are willing to work hard, it is a very rewarding environment to work. It is very much work hard / play hard and this has helped anchor my lifestyle to being energetic. The people are extremely friendly and welcoming. An environement that really is design to make new employees thrive.



3.) Career progression - The fast moving environment transcends to career movement, which means that your career can be boosted very quickly. It also provides many opportunities to begin your career abroad or in a development role. 



4.) Variety - There are so many different roles/jobs/people/benefits that it isn't possible to get bored. I have been working for over half a year, and I haven't looked at the clock once!

Cons: Manual processes during day to day
Advice: None
Pros: Great autonomy to make decisions

Cons: - They work you like a slave, work life balance is terrible and the management always asks for more than you but never acknowledges your efforts (for them it's normal that you work so late), no gratification for your work

- No support from management

- HR are useless and not helpful

- Not international at all (Switzerland is a very small market with very limited budget, can be quite frustrating during international meetings when you see what other markets can do)

- Burnouts are very common (at least once a month)

- Extremely high turnover

- 0 benefits or perks (apart from free products)

- Very low salary for swiss standards

- Low career opportunities: you will change brands very quickly and they will change your title but come a certain point you won't be able to have such a high position as they are limited in number
Advice: Hire more staff as all teams are understaffed, care more about the team's well being, don't put so much pressure (it's just a jar of cream at the end of the day), if you want to overwork your teams then you should reward them with a higher salary or perks
Pros: Everybody is young (25-30ish), good atmosphere, colleagues get along, free products, you get to make strategic decisions

Cons: - VERY organic, no structure whatsoever they like to call it "Organizational Chaos" and pretty proud of it. This company is for you if you are resilient, and can adapt to changes. This might be too much after a couple of years. 

- Highly competitive and it's hard to find work/life balance.

- Toxic work culture. Work culture is oriented to confrontation. If you don't like to be challenged and like to defend your ideas it might not be the place for you (I did like that)

- Nobody will tell you what and how to do something. You need to be highly proactive and get your way through people

- Above pay rate of the rest of multinationals. Other companies pay better.
Advice: The company has more than 100 years, and it needs structure in order to people not to be burnout. The amount of workload and the little pay makes your employees leads to a 100% assurance of a burnout.
Pros: - Work with amazing and iconic brands. If you are into cosmetics, you might enjoy it a lot. 

- Great company to learn about marketing. I can say this is the best company if you want to work and learn in Marketing. However, it's a really hands-on job. Very holistic job

- Easy to grow within the company (as long as you show results)

- A young organization, therefore I found long-lasting friendships

Cons: crazy hours and stressful environment
Advice: None
Pros: good opportunity to grow your carrier

Cons: High workload and stress
No solutions to reducing this
Making teams leaner and adding no headcount
High targets and limited resources
Many people having work related mental health breakdowns
Advice: None
Pros: Good brand on CV
Free/discounted beauty products

Cons: French culture 

Long hours

Volatile 

Tough culture 

Networking
Advice: None
Pros: Ambitious 

Flexible 

Horizontal 

Proactive 

Nice people

Cons: low salary and low work-life balance
Advice: None
Pros: good environment and lovely workers

Cons: WLB is a myth, unfair treatment, lie to get your numbers, destroy relationships
Advice: None
Pros: Office location

Good name on cv

Cons: presure on Qtr endings &amp; lots push
Advice: care for understanding ground reality
Pros: good working culture , free to work

Cons: - Management and director team who are not open to new ideas

- Very under resourced team

- Long hours... not unusual to do a 60 hour week, and it is somewhat expected to cover the workload

- A high number of interns and graduate scheme individuals - whilst this is great for them to learn working life, the reality is that you have a lot of inexperienced people who are involved in some business critical tasks

- Extremely cut-throat - weekly sales and marketing meetings would tend to have someone leaving at the end in tears (not even joking)

- Rare for all to get their full bonus. Always seemed like an extra hoop to jump through whether you had hit your objectives or not

- Low salary for the location... to have NAMs on circa 40k and SNAMs on 50k does not pay to stay
Advice: Realise that the work hard-play hard expectation does get tiresome after a while. A lot of good, talented people leave within 2 years or so because they've just had enough. Put more staff into your teams and let people enjoy a life outside of work and you will get a lot more from your teams.
Pros: - Vast range of brands

- Product discounts (50% off via the staff shop)

- Young, energetic team

- Relatively central office (Hammersmith)

- Given a lot of responsibility early on

Cons: Growth rate is very slow
Advice: None
Pros: I have learned a lot
International environment

Cons: You are not told of current openings. Salaries are not posted.
Advice: None
Pros: Growth Potential in most markets.

Cons: very nice people and environment
Advice: None
Pros: I am excited to work in loreal

Cons: Not many processes in place
Advice: None
Pros: Good people and culture ☺️

Cons: Demand by season. Central work environment
Advice: None
Pros: Good compensation. Good salary. Time

Cons: The CIO had no CIO experience.  The value or lack of value that he places on supporting teams with IT is felt.  He determines his monthly direction on what Gartner publishes.  Therefore there is little direction.  The budget you are allocated is a joke, yet they expect you to make a difference.  You have to explain every single penny and there is little money for new ideas...unless you are of course in the area of IT which he feels is valuable.  He believes he is into team building when the truth is he has little time for anyone.  Department communication is non existent and you have no idea what other parts of IT are working on.  If you are looking for an opportunity to learn and grow...this is not the place to do it.  IT is not highly regarded and up until June of 2011 IT was not part of senior management strategic committee.   If someone in your department leaves the CIO takes the headcount and moves it to the part of IT he feels is more valuable.
Advice: get rid of some of the senior people that are bringing the company down.  360 on Senior Management in HR and IT
Pros: industry

exciting products

Senior Management of some brands are very intelligent

If you are from Europe there is a lot of room for movement and for growth....if you are from the US,,,,,basically forget about it.

Frederic Roze is an efficiency expert, just concerned about cutting costs.

Cons: Kinda sucks one word two words
Advice: None
Pros: I get paid with money

Cons: male dominant energy in my domain
Advice: None
Pros: growth is available at the start

Cons: work schedule is pretty hectic
Advice: None
Pros: work environment is really nice

Cons: many procedures, complicated environment, stress
Advice: None
Pros: ethical company , people management and salary

Cons: Not so great on mapping processes, handovers, and hiring the best person for the job. Manager's skills vary a lot, so depending on which team you are at it can be great or not so much. They still don't have 360 reviews, which could help the company to find out how their managers perform. Be prepared for a lot of overtime, rather a hectic day time and never-ending changes. The HR team is not what can be expected from the company at that level. Quite a lot of people getting stressed out and sick.
Advice: Managed by example, be aware of stress levels at your teams and do something about it instead of talking about it. Less talking more action. Implement 360 to see how your managers are performing.
Pros: Great international and friendly environment. The best company if you like working in teams and have lots of professional colleagues. Work equipment and workplace top of the range. Very modern and new tech from building to equipment to leading style. Plenty of place for carrier and personal development which is a steep learning curve. It is a fast-changing company which is both good and bad.

Cons: Part of our culture is that we rely more people and personal networks than systems and process. This can create a feeling that things are not always smooth or defined. It is not considered a bad thing for the organization, as it has worked for more than 100 years, but it is not always easy for newcomers to understand. You have to be someone that wants to work in ambiguity and constant change.
Advice: None
Pros: My favorite part of the L'Oreal culture is the never-ending quest to create and innovate. No matter what your job is, you will be expected to find new and better ways to work and to challenge the old way of thinking. Leadership is more accessible than most companies of similar size, and top managers encourage junior staff to disagree with them and create an opportunity for debate - this is how we get our best ideas! One of the perks is that you will never need to buy any beauty or grooming products (at least not a full price). There always seems to be free goods or you can shop in the L'Oreal company stores.

Cons: Unsustainable work environment that won't survive the shifts in expectations coming from millennials. 

After almost 10 years at the company I feel like I have seen it all at L'Oréal. Even though I left the company grateful I also left it exhausted. I have experienced being harassed, bullied and awarded all in one day and that is not a unique situation, its expected.
Advice: Hire, promote and train leaders that can do more than manage their operational tasks at hand. Promote the ones who actually lead, develop talent sustainably and empower. You can only rely on the excuse of "the French work style" for so long. What is the real reason your turnover amongst newly hired is so high? 

Develop next generation leaders instead of just marketeers and you will be invincible.
Pros: The most fun I have ever had at a job. Expect to spend your day laughing in the best possible company. Great challenges to overcome and every day is different. 10 years, 3 countries and 5 positions later - this company taught me everything I know about sales, marketing and digital. Best thing? If you have an amazing idea you will always be allowed to develop it.

Cons: While in some companies management trainees have their own projects, a lot of departments where you get your rotations treat you as a free labor to do the most boring work. Many managers don't understand that you are paid twice as much as a basic intern, and it would be more useful for the company and the trainee to give more interesting projects with some responsibility. So my advice is to ask upfront for a specific project (as it will help you gain management experience), and avoid routine work which people just try to get rid of (it doesn't teach you anything and doesn't bring any value) or try to share it, otherwise your motivation will dissapear very soon.

It seems also that headcount in some departments is not right at all - some people work till 9-10 p.m. very often, while others always leave at 6 p.m. (not because they are more efficient)
Advice: Develop a specific program for each trainee with projects they can be solely responsible for. Tell managers that it's a waste of resources to give a lot of routine work to management trainees (they are paid sometimes more than junior brand managers and more than most "specialist" positions)
Pros: A lot of nice people, no dress code, free lunch

Cons: 1. The internship is real hard work, especially when you're in the sales team. It'll drive you crazy to fulfill the sales target. 

2. You get a lot pressure if you want to be outstanding within the team. So you get emotional every now and then. 

3. They do have great culture, but they're not open for mistakes, you can't have any excuse if you don't get your job done.
Advice: When I was working there, I didn't get any mentor around me, I made mistakes and I fixed them. The HQ didn't really care about each of its employees that much.
Pros: 1. If you're a current college student in China, especially a junior one, it'd be a great opportunity for you to apply for Summer Intern at L'Oreal Group. It challenges you a lot no matter which department you'd work for. And it'll help a lot for the later interview process of their Management Trainee Program. 

2. Great HR team, really professional, they advise you and help you prepare everything. 

3. Once you get involved in their Management Trainee Program, you'll have smooth career advancement if you do work hard. And the working environment is great, you'll see your peers are all professional and outstanding.

Cons: - overtly aggressive corporate culture. Always a sense of urgency 
- work life balance is non-existant
- Not introvert friendly, must be over the top and fake to fit in. Sheep-like atmosphere.
- paid for 40 hrs however the workload of my collègues and I require 60-65 hours per week
- good for people under 30 only. Not family friendly as this company simply does not respect having a life outside of loreal 
- company leaves a ridiculous amount of responsibility on junior level employees with little to no support from upper levels or mentors. They then pass it of as “entrepreneurial”
- Half of the company  consists of expats from France who have nothing here and have nothing better to do than work 13 hrs a day
- departments work in silos
- more time spent in meetings that working on your desk
Advice: Your corporate culture is toxic and flawed and if not fixed employment will be a continuous revolving door.
Pros: - competitive salary 
- good Benefits
- good school (get to reinvent the wheel for many projects and processes)
- good brand on your CV
- flex hours, work from home, and summer hours
- Not micro managed and left to make decisions that impact the business.

Cons: Micro management

Need to speak French

Lack of innovation unless you work in Paris

No strategic value unless you are a senior manager in Paris

Some people have been promoted simply as they have been there a long time even if they lack any common sense and judgement

They never think you'll leave

Some senior managers will not even recognise junior people's exsistence

The CEO thinks this therefore you think this
Advice: Look for the young bright sparks and promote them accordingly not purely on time accrued  

Take on management consultants, they are expensive but they will make you more efficient

All countries do not operate the same, a product may work in one place and not in another, local staff need to be able to speak up

Senior management from Paris need to hit reality, dare to speak to some junior people and ask them honestly what they think not just the people trying to impress you to get your jobs.
Pros: Responsibility for a project

The girls

The name of your resume

Potential to progress quickly due to high turnover of staff

Cons: Politics

Lack of effective systems and technology

Lack of headcount - there are too few people to achieve the objectives set for the business by Paris

Workload and expectations are huge

Lack of process and an air of confusion about who is responsible for what which is disguised as flexibility and creativity

Graduate and intern recruitment is huge which sometimes gives an overriding feeling of immaturity and lack of experience.

Pay is much lower than market average
Advice: Increase headcount and give people the opportunity to excel at what they do. Currently, people are too busy trying to cram in the basics to reveal their true flair.

Invest in systems that work and spend money on making them appropriate for the business. Currently, a business process that works is being altered and adapted to suit the system.

Diversity needs to be considered more, from a politically correct standpoint, but also from the perspective of the 'type' of person being employed. Everyone is very similar in terms of their approach and personality.
Pros: Great brands that people are genuinely passionate about

Great events and parties - emphasis on fun

Lots of responsibility for those who want it

Lovely staff shop and freebies

People are constantly open to change and new ways of doing things

Cons: -very stressful environment

-too busy to train new employees

-people are not so welcoming, too much backstabbing and gossiping

-life revolves around work, don't expect a personal life

-high turnover, can't keep employees 

-HR lies to new recruits, promises them of a dream job

-Most workers are young, because they are mostly fresh from university or have little experience, still naive, but they soon realize the L'Oreality and leave.  A new set of young naive recruits enter and another set of overworked tired workers leave...this cycle never ends.
Advice: Hire more people, the problem is that people leave due to high stress because there's not enough personnel.  You will always have people leaving if you don't listen to their needs.  Everyone is swamped with work. Stop focusing on production for a moment and try focusing on the real  and bigger problem: employees well-being.  If you ask every single employee if they are satisfied, they will tell you they hate this place.  You only realize how brutal L'Oréal is once you get to work there, otherwise, it seems like the ideal place, bunch of bullcrap.
Pros: -Good starting salary

-discount on products

-unlimited overtime

Cons: -Long hours; you will often have to work long hours. This can be a positive or a negative, as if you enjoy your job then there are always new and orginal tasks to be done. However, if you are not accustomed to longer hours, then I can imagine it being an inconvenience.
Advice: -Provide more training courses to interns.
Pros: -Responsibility; from your first week there shall be a considerable amount of responsibility handed to you, allowing an individual to make a significant difference within the business from an early stage

-Atmosphere; the work atmosphere in the office is warm and lively, everyone in the office are very approachable and more than happy to help

-Challenges; if you want to take on a new and exciting challenge, teams are very open to giving you project opportunities that shall help you develop in the direction you are interested in

-never the same; every day is different in the office, when you walk into the office, you can predict about 30% of your day, the rest is often new and exciting challenges that will ensure you are never bored

Cons: You are only as good as your last presentation. Your managers and HR are constantly judging you and putting you in categories- Fast track? Poor performer? Be prepared to play politics...hard. If you don’t want to play the game-get out. Bravo you’ve been promoted to a new division. Not really. Now you have to re-prove yourself all over again. I’ve heard it over and over again - everyone is replaceable. Nope you aren’t special.  Sorry. Transparency is not king. Everything is hush hush. Rumours are constantly flying.
Advice: For some reason you are able to recruit some pretty amazing people. Treat them that way. You are spending so much energy trying to recruit new talent, what about trying to retain your old talent? No one should be allowed to belittle their employees but I have seen managers do it time and time again. Unfortunately they are still there. Their employees aren’t. Hmmm??
Pros: The people that work here for the most part (barring HR and top management) are great! You have the opportunity to work on some pretty cool projects. Location of office is amazing and very central.

Cons: -no work / life balance 

-v long hours 

-political, if you are not in the 'clique' you will not progress well in this company

-no transparency on salary bands, you have to fight for increase at every opportunity given

-if they want you to leave they make this obvious - via unwarranted capability process or just limiting your progression so you feel you have no choice but to leave

-high pressure which leads to a very stressful environment 

-large workload but small teams due to limited headcount

-meeting charters not respected, not unusual to have a meeting commence at 6pm

-there is a need to permanently cover your back by cc'ing all into e-mails or following up any phone calls with a written e-mail

-as an employee you do not feel valued, you feel replaceable
Advice: 1. Your employees are your assets- remember that.

2. GM's -you need to manage your egos.

3. Before pointing a finger of blame at an employee, look at the assets/resources they are given to do their job.
Pros: -Discounted products

-looks great on CV

-good opportunities to learn

-can move into international roles

Cons: Too much favouritism and hate politics. More attention is paid to your image rather than what you bring forth to the table. It's like working in a chawl filled with dumb fashionistas.
Advice: Cut down on your extravagant expenditures. France must get a hold on employees and mancomm's leave structures and attendance. Install finger swyping. Ppl work for two days in a week and get paid for five and still have leave balance at the end of the year. Get accountability in order. There is too much favouritism and undercut in employing vendors, consultants etc which is a known industry fact. All business is routed through vendors who give a cut to the management and everyone knows that. It's just a given. You will survive well here only if you are dishonest or good looking. Unfortunately, that's the kind of employees the HR seeks and prefers to tame. Mr. Agon, you're not only running  Loreal globally, but also running the homes of your India Mancomm, which don't run on their salaries but on your company's expenses. Personal expenses are billed to company and shown as company expenditures. HR is well aware but won't do anything. Till the time the entire Mancomm and senior management is not reshuffled or refurbished, this company will not report the profits it's capable of reporting.
Pros: Good work life balance and discounts on products.

Cons: - Progression is fixed - no faster than two years

- The company is still extremely digitally illiterate and slow on the uptake of digital

- Lack of processes, so it's chaotic, inefficient, and unproductive

- Employee welfare is not a priority for HR, neither does the culture focus on this. Everyone eats at their desks way too much, concerns about working hours are dismissed, there is very little appreciation for what you do

- Marketers are really more project managers who implement diktats handed to them from the central Paris office with no meaningful creative or strategic input

- Culture is competitive, not collaborative

- Cliquey 

- If you don't fit their overly prescriptive mold (extroverted, into sport, drinking and going out to bars and clubs every waking moment, lack of intellectual interests), you will not fit in or last
Advice: Define what the culture is, look after employees, fix inefficiencies, get up to speed with how marketing is now done, allow individuality to flourish
Pros: - The morning walk as you approach the building with the L'Oréal logo above gives you that five seconds of glam you so crave.

Cons: - highly demanding with long hours due to lack of process and meeting inefficiency.

- strong culture can be very hard to adopt when coming from other companies. micromanagement from top executives down to the smallest execution details.

- short term and internal decision making process can get in the way of long term gains.

- interpersonal leadership skills dont always determine who gets promoted.
Advice: - take specific, measurable actions behind existing programs to improve work/life balance so that teams see quick wins of it.

- reward managers with team leadership skills: broaden manager's evaluation criteria beyond business results, making teams take an active role in the evaluation of their managers with an impact on their current and future career moves.
Pros: - fast learning curve, very dynamic and changing environment that fosters challenging how things are done (faire et refaire pour mieux faire) with the means and resources to make ideas happen. 

- focus on results, not process.

- young, international teams who are passionate about the beauty industry and forging strong networking relationships with their coworkers. 

fast paced careers with international and very flexible paths.

- increasing focus on social/environmental/ethical impact at all levels of the company, strongly promoted by top management.

Cons: Team, manager, environment, daily tasks
Advice: None
Pros: A very good annual salary

Cons: &gt; No Handover, No Notes, No Support

&gt; HR have their heads in the clouds about the state of not only the business, but also the state of their own department.

&gt; Either non-existent or not very robust commercial controls/checks/balances

&gt; I was lied to in order to get someone to accept the role that I accepted - i should have known it would be a nightmare based on all of the experiences of colleagues and friends of mine that have either worked there or been exposed to its culture
Advice: Stop resting on your laurels, good product alone isnt going to keep L'Oreal alive - not only are you losing good talent but will find it difficult to attract and retain good talent if you dont look inwards at what you could and should fix within the business. Also need to look at the knowledge levels of people in the business that advise clients and professionals on your product - I have been made aware of numerous occasions where "Technical Support" tell people on the phone that "they are the last to know". Fix this, as Salons and professionals are moving away from your product now because you cannot support them. No Sales = No Business.
Pros: None whatsoever - this was an absolute waste of my time.

Cons: - Long working hours. Most of sales do a 10 hour day as a minimum and this is only getting longer (I usually start at 8/8:30am and finish at 7pm), meaning I'm too tired most nights to socialise and switch off. Sales contracts are 35 hours per week...

- Management are very slow to make decisions and often seem to be looking out for themselves by wanting a large amount of information. This can mean that we annoy the retailers and miss opportunities

- More concerned with market share than profit

- Low pay for the market (between £5k and £10k less compared to our competitors), no overtime or days in lieu for all the extra hours

- Little collaborative approach to issues or problems. Those in sales are expected to come up with the answers individually and then present to management, but then of course they're slow to act

- L'Oreal is a very 'lean' company = not enough people to make all the work = sales teams work long hours
Advice: None
Pros: + Job moves happen frequently due to people leaving so there's always something new to get stuck into

+ Agile working means that you can work out of the office once in a while

+ Lots of NPD and new initiatives to keep you busy

+ Ambitious individuals

Cons: 1) 0 work-life balance (meaning you will be expected to work evenings, weekends, holidays, etc...) 

2) HR policy is as follows: a) hire new grads, b) pay them low salaries and work them 60 hour/week, c) they'll stick around anyway because they want the experience and they fell for the "OMG I work at L'Oreal how cool", d) once they've burned out or found normal paying or normal hour jobs elsewhere they'll leave, e) replace them with the next new grad, f) repeat. Different story with management though, I hear they invest in their managers.
Advice: Wow, where do I begin....

a) Hire more people! Maybe than your turnover rate won't be astronomically high! You're loosing money retraining new hires all the time anyway!

b) Pay new grads a decent salary, I know they're easily replaceable, but they're also the backbone of your organization, so invest in your non-management employees.
Pros: 1) good learning opportunity.

2) it's a well known company so it does look good on your resume, but no better or worse than any other well known company.

3) everyone is so overworked and bitter that, ironically, it makes for good conversation and lots of good laughs with the people that you work with.

Cons: I originally started working for another L'oreal brand, which I loved, and am going to write a separate review for. When they decided to merge our brands together, it came with new management, who were complete bullies. They claimed to care about your mental health, and how you're finding it, but in the next breath would belittle you, threaten and bully you. Within the span of an hour, I was told I had no talent, that I was never a makeup artist, and would only benefit from small, unknown brands outside of L'oreal. The way the company treated staff who weren't management was disgusting. Two members of staff were signed off with stress in one month due to the way this brand treats people. I truly loved L'oreal when I started working for them, but never again would I consider working for this despicable company.
Advice: Actually care about your employees. Don't pretend to in attempts to save face. Stop letting in store management take advantage (Going home early, Taking Lieu time they never accrued, getting other employees to do their job for them, ETC). The bullying towards younger staff is appalling, considering they will be the future of your brand. Also, keep your promises of progression
Pros: Staff Shop

Allocation (If you ever got all of it)

Cons: Long hours - but this is improving with strategies like summer working hours (finishing at 3pm on Fridays)

If you don't enjoy a highly changeable and fast moving environment - L'Oreal may not be a good choice as an employer - you need to love change and be very flexible

Communication is really important - you cannot rely on emails to build relationships - you have to build networks to get the best results
Advice: Sometimes expectations are so high that managers can forget to show appreciation of effort put in.  What would be considered a 'great' performance in other companies is often only considered a 'good' performance at L'Oreal.
Pros: Meritocratic environment - if you are a great performer your career will fly

'Can-do' attitude - very solutions focused

Networked environment - you can get decisions made very quickly

Exciting environment - hundreds of launches every year

Not proceedural - you have a lot of room to make decisions and stretch the boundaries of your role

Passionate people - creates an inspiring environment

Cons: Who really wants to work get overloaded with little recognition. All evaluations will tell you how great you are but you salary you remain the same for as long as they can keep it that way. All teams are always understaffed.
Advice: Get a better HR team. 

Most of the managers are really young and do not have a clue about managing.

If there is a department where every employee is working 20 extra hours for the past 10 weeks, it means that they are understaffed! No need to wait 2 years to get to this conclusion!

Make the decision process faster. I understanding it is a big company, but sometimes it is better to choose a path, even if it is not the best one rather than not choose at all.

Marketing must have freedom, but they also must know what they should do.

Operations needs processes. All freedom must have limits.
Pros: Great place to learn. L´Oréal is a company that encourages employees to do their best and be owners of their projects. I never thought that I would have so much freedom to do my work.

Cons: -Lack of direction & leadership will wear you down- be warned.

-Very strange culture across particular divisions- high focus on 'boys club' & overseas people are often bought into the country rather than promoting from within or local talent options.

-Very long hours with lack of reward or recognition for people's contribution- a lot of talk around fixing this but highly unlikely until they change the management in particular divisions. Note- summer hours don't cut it for what you actually sacrifice. 

-Do not ever expect to get a correct report- never before have experienced such a poorly run operation for a global leader.

-Poor financial controls although so much focus is on this there is little or no idea what is going on in the business.

-Living in the stone ages with technology. 

-No clear KPI's everyone has their own agenda.

-You will do things 100 times over without having clear direction on what was actually required to begin with.

-No training or education at all for employees.

-Bullying style of management.

-No team culture very divided
Advice: Read the above & listen to the feedback in the industry- this says it all.
Pros: Products are great this is the only key feature of this company

Cons: A lot of working hours +50/week. Everyone is from the same generation and no real experienced people around to look up for. No real over your career as they have a path for you and even if you may voice a certain interest in a certain position they will not grant it to you if they have another idea for you. THERE IS NO FAIRNESS IN HOW POSITION ARE GRANTED.
Advice: The arrogance of L'Oréal HR on how they take control of someone's career or think what is best for you needs to change if they want to keep good people with competencies. They have to be more transparent and more fair in the way they give promotions. They need to have a more representative mix of people, not only young, but more experienced people.
Pros: You gain a lot of experience in a very short period of time. Collegues are young, fun and have a great positive energy. There are a lot of opportunities always available within the comapnies.

Cons: You cannot go half way. You have to be strongly involved and work enough to succeed. 

Do not wait for People to tell you what to do. You would be disappoint. Be daring and make proposals. Take risks. 

Be ready to get feedbacks positive & negative & learn from them. 

There is a constant quest for Excellence that means you have to be ready to always learn & train, to do projects, undo them, to redo them better.
Advice: Great New Behaviors Project started in 2016 for even more Team Collaboration, Trust & Empowerment. Keep going !
Pros: The Pleasure to work with Talented & Passionate Colleagues in Diverse Teams .

The Chance to Always Grow thanks to strong investments in trainings like the 5stars Digital Upskilling. 

The Opportunity to have an Impact, to be an intra-preneur and lead change from day one whatever your position or age. 

The Possibility to have a well balanced and fulfilling Family Life and to contribute to a better world through meaningful Projects ( Sustainability & Social ).

Cons: The workload is horrendous. Doing extra hours is an expectation in London but the volume of work meant a poor work-life balance. Don't expect to be promoted to higher management unless you are or at least speak French - of the 6 senior management roles in my division only 1 of them was not French. Management skills need a leave a lot to be desired - the structure is incredibly hierarchical which is not to the best effect. Finally be prepared for politics - it's not always what you know or who you know but how loudly you can shout above the crowd.
Advice: Please think about bringing some additional people into the team to allow room to breathe, think and develop. Reconsider your secondary management. Realise that people should always come first and results will follow naturally.
Pros: There is oodles of opportunity to take on a project and go above and beyond. My peers were lovely across many different functions and there was a general vibe to do well and succeed. It's an ever changing, competitive environment that can really suit some people and the pace is fast - challenging projects can often be expected to be delivered within limited time frames. Also, the products are great with big discounts.

Cons: - Terrible top management. 

No guidance or assistance when you need help. But if things would go bad, you are to blame   Example: Especially in the first few months in your first job ever, you should be able to ask some questions as you are like an alien. In my case, it wasn't allowed to ask "how" questions. You could only suggest a possible set of solutions to your manager and he would choose the direction for you. How you are supposed to get to those options is a mystery. You can ask around of course but nobody would have time for you. 



-Tough, unwelcoming culture. 

Feedbacks are not constructive. If you lack a certain attribute, they'd rather change you than invest in you.

Everybody is focused on their own success. No team spirit. At least it was so in my case. A lot of people feel like outsiders.



- Long working hours

Was never a problem for me but for a lot of people I can imagine that it could be.
Advice: You really need a bit more empathy... Please investigate why the turnover rate is so high and burn out are so common.
Pros: - Great brands

- Lots of early responsibility

- Quick career advancement

Cons: Key aspects of projects can change on the last minute (but in a way is a Pro as well). There are no / very less systems/ policies/ procedures. Proud to claim 'have resisted systems for the last 100 years, and will continue to resist for another 100'. (again a Pro for some). The company is very very European (infact French), hence not very frank an open. Everything is a closely guarded secret with formalities (almost royal treatment) reserved for higher management. Company culture is a bit laid back, with tolerance for poor performance (in other words less accountability). renumerations/ benefits are more bargain based rather than being systematic or performance based.
Advice: Keep more detailed focus on country managements. More accountability will result in fixing things properly and permanenetly. as a company, we never learn from mistakes in other countries
Pros: Higher independncy in taking decisions. Faster decisions making (due to lesser dependence on systems/procedures/policies). Higher tolerance for mistakes (hence allows to try and be more creative/ bold). Higher speed of initiatives hence the flexibility.

Cons: - Middle management is a bit weak, most people seem to be promoted based on duration in the company

- Lack of empathy from management and HR 

- Salary in operations is not on par with other FMCG companies

- Long hours and weak IT systems. A lot of administrative work that may not exist in other companies due to the weak systems

- High turnover rates, which leads to the same problems and issues arising every year. Job gets repetitive after a while
Advice: Need to listen more to people on the ground and not disregard their advise and opinions.
Pros: - Employees generally treat each other with respect. You will make lifelong friends here. Culture is quite fun if you can fit in

- Opportunity to work overseas through expatriate/ mobility programs

- Development opportunities, although you need to perform well in your role to access these opportunities. If you are average/ below average, opportunities are limited

- Company is committed to ethics and sustainability

- Fringe benefits like free products and staff price

Cons: Very partioned work flow, I find I need to deal with numerous departments and people to accomplish one simple goal. I would prefer information a bit more linear and accessible without going thru so many channels.
Advice: Consolidate information databases, make a one stop for broader range of information.
Pros: Management is very flexible and respective of personal committments. I find that the work experience is satisfactory and a certain level balance is present. No one carries more of a load than others. I do enjoy numerous perks such as affiliations with other companies like Apple, NYSC, Verizon and so forth. The perks extend to the products themselves, I find that I am able to stock up on great products for the entire family without spending a dime most instances. From a Finacial persepective, I am looking forward to the consolidation of Accounting and Finance in the new building next year. This should encourage more interaction between these two important job functions.

Cons: Russian office is suffering a lot during last 2-3 years. Marketing teams had been completely changed several times, brand managers came and just in some time leave the company, they simply rejected to work in such conditions. The main reason: lack of strategic thinking behind actions. Top management is undoubtedly very professional, but middle management and especially their attitude to their teams leave much to be desired. A good place to start career but do not recommend to come from another company
Advice: Invest in people, start to treat staff as main company's asset. Brand and products are nothing if there is no good team behind, especially in marketing
Pros: Fantastic products and brands, outstanding brand development teams in DMI, consequently plenty of innovations that continuously launching on the market. Also since this is beauty company, that beauty touch is felt everywhere. In Russian office you can be promoted really fast and become marketing director in your 30 (but actually I doubt that this is a good point)

Cons: There's a lot of pressure and since it's a very changing, fast paced enviroment not everyone resist the pressure. People can be a little too stressed or too pressure mainly during the seasons.
Advice: Be closer to the people; challenge your teams but give them tools to grow and improve with the company. Listen to them and make people a priority because that's were the results come from.
Pros: It's a company with a great work enviroment, very young, fast paced and creative. All ideas are welcome and you feel truly appreciated and truly listened even when your ideas are not implemented they always listen to you. The Ethics departement is constantly checking everyone is treated farly and respectfully and they are very accesible. The products are great wich adds a lot of fun to the work, sometimes they give frees samples to the employees so you can try them. It a very fast paced company so you are challenged to constantly developing new skills and improving the way you do things.

Cons: You will only get commission if you hit the sales target per month. If you don't, the basic pay is akin to getting paid peanuts. And the sales target only rises every month. 

Have to travel everywhere depending on which location you get dropped to.

Peer pressure. 

Not for anybody who's in for fast cash. You need passion, guts and a face made of steel for this job. It gets rewarding in the long run as you get more experienced.
Advice: Change your part time clock in system from a written one to a fully digitalised one. I hope you have already. Other than that, solid job.
Pros: Pretty cushy job as you are only required as a part timer to sell and introduce products to prospective clients. 

Supportive HR

Every location has a different type of customer and target audience, so you get to interact with all sorts of people.

Pretty high commission.

You get to use and sample the products.

You get training, and that helps to prepare for your work.

Cons: Hierarchy has no transparency in modus operandi. Totally dishonest and pass on the ball at higher management level. How come Mancomm can be so blind, that they do not realise the ground zero reality. You cannot be a fannatic in approach. HR is only for the name sake as they have no other jobs than to send employee joining details. Because of some higher management people, the entire credentials of the business operation of Loreal is at stake and attrition rate of ground zero guys are substantially high. Even repute in market has gone done and its impossible to recruit talented manpower for 1st and 2nd line ff under Loreal banner.
Advice: Please reveiw it as people leaving the pool have no gain other than helping you to retain the existing talent you have left with. Also down size the bunch of highly paid non deserving Managers to retain the left so called Culture and Values of Loreal.
Pros: I experienced no pros , other than great Brands.

Cons: Many members of management are not great leaders

The vision is not always clear 

Can be slow to implement change on "must-haves" 

Base salaries not competitive and lack transparency to salary scale

HR does not work with you but against you to meet their own objectives and not the company's

Need to do a great deal with small budgets
Advice: Scratch the surface of your leadership team. Too much "smoke and mirrors" and lack of real substance

Provide more growth opportunities to your senior management. 

Align your HR team to company goals and department requirements. Make them listen to what is truly needed. Involve them more in the business to reduce making bad hiring decisions which affect team morale and company revenues.

More transparency from the top
Pros: Very entrepreneurial which allows you to learn a great deal

Lots of freedom to implement initiatives

Great offices and location

Many opportunities to move within the company

Access to great products

Many employee-focused benefits (work from home, discounts, benefits, pension)

Cons: - Bullying, cliques of people

- No work-life balance and extreme workload

- No humanity, you are a number and always replaceable 

- They only care about numbers, not about the employees

- Not ethical, even though they claim to be

- HR does not care about you, they listen to the higher ups. 

- You will work weekends all the time and it is never enough. 

- If you divide your salary with the amount of hours, you make less than minimum salary

- Prepare yourself for international VP visits during which you will not sleep for over a month

- Only for extraverts, A type personalities. 

- They want everyone to be the same, they do not focus on strengths.
Advice: The culture of this company needs to change. Treat your employees like humans, not slaves. Care about your people. I was bullied by my own boss for 2 years and HR did nothing so I left. Ended up in a burnout. Trust me, it's NOT worth it.
Pros: - Good on your CV

- Learn to be a slave, so all your future jobs with seem easy 

- Bonus and benefits are good

Cons: - Beyond my team (ie the nerdy ones :-) ) it felt like I was living in the Devil Wears Prada

- Not a very hardworking atmosphere

- Employees were not always appropriate (behaviour, clothes etc) for a working environment

- Culture of interns (not my team) doing boring and bottom of the pile work til late

- Very transient work force, people come and go so quickly development is slow
Advice: Better communication channels between the different brands and global teams (scientific, legal etc). 

Individual's responsibility to set up an organisational map of when people come and leave jobs
Pros: - Lots of women so a very different to usual working environment 

- My team were VERY friendly and helpful (not all teams were)

- Very work load conscious and careful that I was still enjoying my summer break

- Lots of care given to the type of projects I was working on so that they were interesting

- TONNES OF FREEBIES AND FREE HAIRCUTS/MANICURES etc

Cons: - Horrible work-life balance.  Be prepared to make work your priority in life.

- No leadership, only incompetent directors and managers.  No vision, no original thoughts, no mentoring.  Upper management only acts as the metrics police with no strategy or ability to improve their functional area or the overall business.

- Disfunctional environment with unrealistic expectations.  Get more done with less.  Demand improvement without change.  Collaboration amongst departments is below standard.

- No autonomy or respect for experience and creativity.  Better do it the L'Oreal way.

- Micromanaged by the executives who visit too often just to overstate the obvious and continuously change the focus and direction of the plant initiatives.

- Unhealthy conflict is encouraged and viewed as a strength in those who thrive in arguments.

- Pretend to invest in new systems and ideologies.  In reality, the business continues to be mismanaged the same way for years.  It's all wasted money on poorly executed initiatives and programs led by consultants.
Advice: Thank goodness for a strong brand name that can absorb the inadequacies of a deficient management group.
Pros: - Good medical and benefits

- Company store

Cons: some managers doesn't give the real appreciations no matter how hard worker you are, there is some communication issues between the managers and their teams. my manager wasn't supporting me all the time. the HR as much as they are doing the best to make the work place better but they didn't take a considerations when it's comes to any reasons why people get terminated.
Advice: please give your team a space to breath and to speak up freely about the negative points and listen to them when it comes to what they feel and what they think when it's related to the work and the business, for the HR please ask the employee about the real reason why they cannot work smoothly with their managers. and before you decide to terminate  anyone make sure that you have investigate enough to be fare.
Pros: Career Opportunities , Benefits, Culture, Diversity

Cons: Not much training. You're expected to come in swim or sink.

High turnover (internal and external) - Next thing you know people you deal with everyday is moving on to a new role or quit.

Bonus is meager, unless you're senior mgmt.
Advice: They have to value their employees more. I see too many good people get poached from competitors, which means that the company is not being compensated/recognized very well. It doesn't make sense to develop an employee for several years and then lose them to a competitor for nothing but a small promotion or $10-$15K raise (I mean, that's practically nothing to the company in monthly terms).
Pros: Global company (you can transfer to other locations/countries).

Good place to build a network, whether for relationships within the company or later on in the career.

Recognized name in the industry so it's good when you want to move on.

Cons: Improvement in integration in role

Credit should be given where credit is due ;)
Advice: Reward the managers who develop their teams and develop individuals (yes its about the numbers but its about people too)
Pros: L`Oreal is a place where you can learn a tremendous amount

You eat what you cook =  you work hard, you will get rewarded

The people are incredible, kind and intelligent and make coming into work a pleasure

The diversity of backgrounds create a inclusive atmosphere

The professional division is a great place to learn, strive and cooperate (my favorite division)

Cons: Level of stress on employees is enormous and for some hard to handle. Chaotic culture of constant change of mind is very deep in the company's DNA. In love with its products, and less oriented towards consumers. Definitely not a people-centric company, one does not feel appreciated by a system, but more as a very replaceable gear wheel. Promises from management very easy to be given, but hard to be implemented later.
Advice: People do matter. Don't forget you depend on Millennials and Generation Z. And both of them want to be appreciated and can tell a heavy photoshop when they see it.
Pros: Very fast-paced environment, with a relaxed and friendly corporate culture when it comes to people relations. Great for learning and developing your potential because of demanding challengesin front of you. High level of autonomy. If you have a record of good results your ideas and proposal will be highly appreciated and very possibly implemented.

Cons: Not having a dedicated office in Cape Town to support sales team, due budget constraints within local office and thus a restrictive head count in division meant added work load, facilities within the offices could have been of a higher standard and at times created an inconvenience, lack of ongoing training and skill development opportunities available to current staff to improve and expand within their role, hiring of incorrect individuals causing complications and set backs in the work processes and systems and thus a lack of accountability and frustration within teams and divisions
Advice: None
Pros: Fantastic benefits &amp; package, opportunity to travel, great incentive plans, career growth potential and opportunities, fantastic graduation programme allowing entry to company, international brand experience, exposure to diverse range of markets and brands, enjoyable work culture and ethos, involvement in and exposure to 360 degree spectrum of business functions allowed for holistic understanding of how production and business works

Cons: Competitive, long hours and week-ends, poor work/life balance, salary below market average and not in line with amount of work, too many meetings, gossipy environment, Toronto office not downtown.
Advice: Try to create an environment where you can have a better work-life balance. Making an environment where it is seen as bad to leave the office before 8 or not do any work on the week-end might be ok for people who it is their first job and want to move the corporate ladder quickly but it won't help you attract good talent from other company and it will keep you with a high turn-over rate where employees will leverage their under-paid job to a better playing employer offering better conditions.
Pros: Fun people to work with, fast track to get promotion and career advancement, opportunity to touch many different roles, well located

Cons: 1. Still an old fashion type of company in a state of the art building with billion euros profit 
2.They really need to review their HR
3.Big question mark in diversity, they need to improve their efforts in providing sufficient working condition to female employees so they can grow their career 
4.Oh yeaa politics ...
5.Stuck career movement unless u are happy with constant situation and poor package of compensation 
6.Make it clear on what you wants to HR and your leaders make sure it is well writen before you make any deal on assignment.
Advice: Your employees is your investment. Treat them at its best.
Pros: Great in reputational management but they really need to walk the talk! 
They are good in making jargons n tagline
Good perks but also quite political in the leadership team
Good in insurance coverage for family
Free products 
System already in place just like other multinational company
Commitment in the social and environmental management is clear and proven

Cons: Despite the numerous yearly evaluations done to the employees, HR does not fully nor profesionally review them before firing someone, so they keep firing good people just becuse "a Manager said so". 

In the end, you can be fired just becuse a new boss is not very found of you in a personal level, depite your many top contributions to the Company. So sad!
Advice: Establish additional control and investigation processes within HR, to ensure that your top employees are not fired for personal or false reasons.
Pros: I worked there for almost 9 years and the overall experience was awsome!!

L'Oréal is a place where you'll never get bored and where you'll be able to learn and apply as much as you want. There is a lot of freedom to work and they also offer great additional benefits such as flex-time, home-office, etc.

I loved every single moment of my time there!!

Cons: Lack of clarity over career opportunities for Graduates at the end of the program, stemming from an inability to confront the realities of the situation (too many graduates, too few operational roles). Responsibilities and amount of engaging (as opposed to menial) work varies too much from role to role on the graduate scheme, with some roles similar to operational roles and others too heavily admin based.
Advice: Re-consider the role of the graduate scheme (cheap labour or future leadership development) and adapt the balance between entry level full-time roles and graduates accordingly. More formal organisation of graduate scheme such that it is ensured all management trainees have serious responsibilities and engaging work across all roles.
Pros: Relatively good benefits. Young, energetic colleagues. Friendly, relaxed atmosphere on the whole. Relatively flexible working arrangements. High level of mobility between functions. Well-structured graduate program, with exposure to variety of roles, responsibilities and functions.

Cons: - Work work work... And very manual work...

 - Lotsa carrying, lifting, clearing because of messy storage areas!

 - Limited and pathetic storage of GWPs, Uniforms, Docs etc. Most of the time are spent in thinking how to dispose, hide or disperse them to outlets...

 - Competitive environment, more so when you're in the sales team.

 - Lotsa yellings from sales and it's considered normal. Managers shouting at staff on the phone happens everyday.
Advice: Think about why is there a higher turnover for certain brands, didn't it came across your mind that empty yelling are useless and people are more resistant to change when they're being yelled at. (for nothing and fr not understanding the reasons behind the yelling...)
Pros: - Lotsa opportunities whether you wanna move up or across the brands

 - Friendly and helpful colleagues

 - Tons of trainings and benefits available (if you're free enough to enjoy them, it's there!)

Cons: Human Resource support for expats in Tokyo office lacks professionalism, mainly in salary visibility and administrative support. The tax system is complicated and there is no tax briefing, so you will only know your net income by the end of your expatriation. In my case, a large unanticipated sum (more than 400,000 JPY) was deducted from my final pay. When I requested for clarification, it took them almost a month to reply.
Advice: Improve orientation for new expatriates and standardise the structure for expat packages around the zone. Since the tax system in Japan is more complicated, discuss the packages in NET income instead of GROSS. This will ease the unnecessary stress for expats and give much more visibility where finances are concerned.
Pros: Flexible hours, passionate and fun management, many opportunities for overseas work posting, vibrant and young working atmosphere, great staff discounts. People here are energetic and open to new ideas.

Cons: - extreme pressure

- unrealistic expectations

- little to no structure/process (very chaotic) 

- expected to work long hours and on weekends 

- management and HR are often not transparent with employees (love to promise promotions/move to international offices but always takes much longer than what is promised, or it never happens at all) 

- high turnover rate within teams
Advice: Be more transparent with employees - don't over promise and under deliver on timelines for promotions and moves to international offices
Pros: - a lot of responsibility at a young age

- if they believe you are talented they will reward you and you will get promotions very quickly

- high exposure to upper management early on in your career

- work on some of the most incredible brands in the world 

- learn from amazing, talented individuals

Cons: - Work-life balance is a serious issue (great for those who strive for career and put their ambition above everything);

- Company needs to train more their leadership (inexperience): sometimes the intern experience is decided on who your leader is.

- Sometimes the experience can be too intense (importance of tasks vs. workload)
Advice: The Management/Leadership needs to be trained to do a better job at managing their interns/team.
Pros: - Very challenging experience, I wouldn't find an internship with such a great amount of responsabilities and projects anywhere else (in Portugal);

- Engaged employees who "breathe" L'Oreal;

- A company where relationships matter: in a few months I knew the company from one end to the other (around 200 employees in the office);

- The business and sector is very dynamic: Human Resources is highly strategic, instead of administrative.

Cons: - No babysit culture (applicable to new hires) - may serve as a challenge for new hires who prefers to work alone with minimum interaction as you need to take initiative in reaching out to your buddies/ mentors/ internal stakeholders 

- Not the top payer in FMCG
Advice: Please look into improving dated benefits for local markets and key functions
Pros: - Results driven company, therefore high pressure and fast paced culture, which equates to having colleagues who are direct and straight forward but not unreasonable; they are actually helpful if you take the 1st step to approach and ask questions

- A company that actually works WITH you on your career development, and offers internal mobility (disclaimer: for good/ top performers that genuinely delivers at work!)

- Flat hierarchy 

- Genuinely encourages "speak up" culture, values voices and opinions of talents regardless of seniority

Cons: the workload is very high and you usually work till night.the environment and the culture are not the best. competing so much takes also the worst out of people. plus, it's a french company, so huge hierarchy and higher mgmt don't make you feel valuable sometimes.  it's ok for an internship, but i don't know if i would like to spend some years there
Advice: it is necessary to take more care of employees and their needs. more attention to the balance of life and work.
Pros: Very challenging environment, people always compete and that takes out of them their best sometime. Constant feedbacks. Very well structured internship with a mid-intership and a final internship projects. very nice offices, lunch included.  i learnt really really a lot during this experience (my first one), and i have in general a good memory of that, even though there were some flaws

Cons: The IT systems could be better and more cutting edge, but they are working on it and I have seen positive movement to address these issues.
Advice: To continue this great initiative of Beauty for all focusing on sustainable growth both environmentally and socially. Also to continue to inspire a culture of innovation and applauding well calculated risks.
Pros: I have worked for L'Oreal for 7 years and really love it.  I have now lived in 3 countries with L'Oreal and have had an exciting and challenging career path.  I work every day with incredibly intellectually curious people great attitudes that enables us create, innovate and build things every day.  Even though it is a large organization, you still feel the entrepreneurial spirit no matter which function you are in.  The company is also extremely financially stable.

Cons: very low compensation level and other benefits comparing to the market, no opportunities to grow for the locals (the talented ones are squeezed out but the expacts whose knowledge and willingness to share experience and learn new is almost next to nothing) , very high expat level (ca.15%) while the other market rivals have 3-5 expats only. office space is [dis]organized in not ergonomic way and on top of all above - infamous French arrogance
Advice: invest more in your employees, the brands value is nothing in the country where they're not so known to the consumers but employees who are satisfied with their professional aspirations and adequate compensation can make miracles. and higher the most brilliant ones (not the cheapest ones as now!)
Pros: the BEST place to start for the recent graduates (or even last year students) but those experienced ones - look somewhere else

Cons: Management has lost it way 

AVP's and above can't be bothered with people below

No mentoring or succession plans

Not enough people to do the job( do more with less has hit its limit )

Do as I say , not as I do

Very very weak raises

Management is hypocritical in what they preach

You're never good enough

Too many young and inexperienced people

Blaming

Good money and perks don't come until you are an AVP, good luck getting there

Many non inspirational and weak "leaders"
Advice: Stop trying to save a couple of bucks by not hiring enough people to do the work.  We are exhausted!  Hire the people and see how easily and quickly we get the next billion customers.
Pros: The challenge of success pushes you to the edge and really make you think beyond your limits.

International opportunities 

Worldwide networking

Lots of brands

Structure and procedures

Smart people

I have an office ;-)

Cons: The company lack of process can drive anyone crazy. Even if you like to work that way. People tend not to give the proper tools to start working. It's like someone give you a Ferrari without you having a driver license. You have to learn how to drive in the middle of a highway. The company it's completely moved by international visits. If L'oréal CEO or even any Regional Manager comes to your country, get ready for action. Lots of money spent on trying to make a good impression for the top management. The company is completely brand-centric.
Advice: Become more consumer-centric, and less brand-centric. L'oréal and it's brands shoudn't try to impose consumers what to use or like.
Pros: Really dynamic. Everything can change in a few meetings. The company gives you great independence to propose different strategies and solutions. For those with strong heart and great reselience.

Cons: Certain brands can be very hierarchical, lack of work life balance, all bad jobs just get given to 'the intern', not very welcomed into the team. Work isn't appreciated only negative feedback given. Grad scheme is so hard to obtain and for a very specific type of person, making a lot of the successful people the same type. I would have had a much better experience if I was in a different brand and don't blame L’Oreal, but have a negative view on the brand and its General Manager.
Advice: Look into certain brands closer so you can see how the GM's in some brands aren't good leaders and their negative values and outlook feeds down into the company.
Pros: Good staff benefits of staff shop and friends and family sale and get to be a part of exciting opportunities

Cons: International Mobility: A big con is that it does not allow for easy international mobility. Hence, if you want to move out, no matter how much you love the company, you will have to switch jobs

Internal Movement: You will have to wait in the current role for 18 months, before you can even apply to another role. This is a longer time than in most other companies.
Advice: None
Pros: Extremely transparent: You can discuss anything with your boss, especially in sales. There have been multiple instances of something going wrong on field, and the first instinct is to tell the superiors, instead of covering it up

Lot of learning: Since at least in India, it is still growing, a lot of systems are being put in place now. This means that you learn the processes as they are being developed, and can even contribute to it

Cons: Top management level not trustworthy.

Strong culture - if you are not 'loreal-like', you can forget that they will try to embrace you, wherever your experience brings from prior to joining them.

Whether you are a talent or not, is not dependant on your capabilities but rather whether the management likes you.

Office has very high levels of attrition and workload is simply thrown to however is around.

Has 'high hire and fire' situation in singapore office, no work-life balance.

Staff morale is very low.
Advice: In the pursuit of short-term goals, you have lost many talents that has brought loreal to what it is today. 

Hope you can investigate and review what is really happening on the ground and turn the company around, before it becomes a place where beauty professionals shun away from joining.

Good Luck!
Pros: Singapore office has good staff benefits compared to other similar firms in the like industry. 

Internal mobility is fluid internationally - career opportunities are abundant.

Co-workers are nice and friendly, up to middle management levels.

Office is centrally located, near to subway. Amentities are nearby.

Cons: Could be very cut-throat and challenging in certain departments.  Very high expectations, especially in marketing, product development and production management, resulting in high turnover in those areas.
Advice: Redistribute the work load from the departments with a high turnover, as some departments are significantly more difficult to work in, more hours, etc, while in other departments in the same building it could be pretty relaxed.  I know, because I worked on both sides.
Pros: Great benefits, including unheard of 13 paid holidays!

Many promotions from within, especially to manager and director levels.  Also, lots of opportunities to move around in the company to various roles and departments. 

Product discounts - about 50% off for everything made by the company, plus monthly free goods allotment

Cons: Total lack of respect from management: from day one I was told I could never expect to grow up in my career, that I would be stuck in the Assistant role no matter what my performance is. No surprise since in Portugal it is more of "who you know" that matters rather than you being a good professional. I was treated like a maid many times and had to use the word "doctor" before their names like they're some kind of special people. Once I gave a suggestion and the marketing director responded for me to go to away and not give suggestions. No training or support is given, they expect for you to know everything just because. I was happy to get away from this place and I don't recommend the Marketing department at Lóreal in Portugal to no one, unless of course you're one of "who you know" team.
Advice: Learn how to manage people.
Pros: The possibility to bring products for free and the name on the CV.

Cons: - No work-life balance

- A lot of stress, very fast changing of situations, L'Oréal chaos 

- You have to be be fluent French to get to management positions

- Most of the time you aŕe rather a Firefighter than a Financial Controller

- Lower salaries than the competition

- Also incompetent employees can reach responsible positions only by waiting long enough
Advice: None
Pros: - Lot's of experience - As an intern/trainee you can advance very fast to responsible assignments that are done by Senior middle-management in other companies

- Fast career advance

- No boundaries and lot's of opportunities to try out different fields - it is no problem to go from Finance to Purchasing/Procurement and vice versa, however moving from Finance to Marketing, although possible, is not so often to be seen

- Very dynamic

Cons: Working environment in L'Oreal is quite political. I will say much more than other companies in cosumer industry.

The number of women are much more than men. In general, it is not desirable to work with so many women around.

L'Oreal likes to recruit people from high education background in prestigious universities.
Advice: Please do not think that people graduating from prestious universities means that they are great entrepreneurs in business. 

Itis not effective to have so many meetings...
Pros: If you have passion to work at the cosmetic industry and you are ambitious, L'Oreal is quite nice place to work.

L'Oreal give good chances to develp the ability of each emplyoee if you are intelligent.

For example, you can get promoted in a fast-track comparing with other companies.

In addition, you can have many opportunities to work overseas as an expat.

Cons: Very difficult to move forward if you are not "connected" politically

Criteria for promotions not well defined.

If you're not in the management trainee program, you will have trouble moving ahead.
Advice: The company does not do a good job of describing the criteria necessary to move forward.  For example, after 3 consecutive "Exceeds Expectation" reviews, I was still left in the same position as when I started.  Persons I started work with in the management trainee (Tracker) program, who had the same career path and lesser performance reviews, have received promotions and I have not.  There are more people working for the company than those!
Pros: Ability to quickly gain a lot of experience in different areas.

Management does not micro-manage

Good work-life balance.

Very competitive benefit package.

Cons: owever, it is still important to know what the current salary range is for the profession. Find salary surveys at the library or on the Internet, and check the classifieds to see what comparable jobs in your area are paying. This information can help you negotiate compensation once the employer makes an offer.
Advice: Use this as a chance to summarize your good characteristics and attributes and how they may be used to benefit the organization
Pros: What salary are you expecting? You probably don't want to answer this one directly. Instead, deflect the question back to the interviewer by saying something like: "I don't know. What are you planning on paying the best candidate?" Let the employer make the first offer.

Cons: There is always room for improvement.
Advice: Keep giving feedback to your employees. Transparency is always best!
Pros: Always keep raising the bar and reinvent! L'Oreal employees have access to on-line doctor. You just sign in register, then you speak to a nurse you can be given an apt within the same day or are connected right away. The doctor acctualy takes time to discuss with you .  Then does his diagnosis and sends the perscritpion your your pharmacy! I mean I did this twice at the comfort of my home saved my so much TIME and worry! My pediatrician was only avialble 3 days afterwards. I can't say enough about this service. Thank you L'Oreal now that makes my life so much easier!!!!!!!

Cons: Culture managed by fear.  Threatening to fire people constantly...upper management is mostly made up of misogynist men with a few women on complete power trips.   While i worked there, my husband was diagnosed with cancer and no one even ever bothered to ask how i was doing for an entire year.  When I left, they tried to retain me with a counter offer.  My answer was: I don’t know what life holds for me....all I know is that I do want kids, and that my parents will most likely pass in the next few years, things will happen....I dont know what,  I only know one thing for sure, I don’t want to be here when it all happens.  ✌🏻
Advice: Care more about your people and it will come right back at you.
Pros: You can find some of the  most brilliant people here.  You can learn so much from a bunch of extremely smart people

Cons: Too long working hours with no OT pay

Irrational senior management who onky knows to push but no help

Only product focus-limited creativity in marketing

No idea about digital world, think onky to put official content on Internet is enough

Politics and only French or French-lovers can be promoted 

Pyramid effect-top and muddle management don't move so the junior managers keep leaving
Advice: Teach senior managers to control their temper before sending them out to push subsidiaries 

Offer more promotion opportunities or else ppl will keep leaving 

If you cancel profit sharing kits of ppl will leave 

Allow more creative matket and celebrity endorsement is not the only solution

HR is useless
Pros: International exposure 

High quality standard

Early responsibility

World profit sharing

Cons: Management bullying does exist , and HR do not help you .... They bully you into not taking it to tribunal....managers get promoted who have complaints for bullying team 

Favouritism encouraged 

5-6 hrs driving on top of your 8 hr day is allowed by HR

Meetings last for hr...8am start 7pm finish , even though there is a L'Oreal meeting charter up on the walls 

If you have over 8 yrs service they try to get you out rather than pay the salary , trying to go down the capability route , watch out !
Advice: HR need to listen to the team members about management bullying it does go on and needs to be addressed
Pros: Staff shop

Great to have on your cv

Cons: Very hierarchical company structure, resulting in very long decision making processes and also resulting in stressed out people since top management in Paris have no idea/don't care of the workload. Everybody is stressed out and depressed. Very bad work/life balance. Low salary. Last minute decisions and changes all the time, partly because none of the managers dare to say "NO" to Paris. Very competitive culture, also internally. A lot of responsibility but not the same amount of control over decisions - very frustrating. Very old-fashion it /reporting systmes. A lot of time spend on reporting to Paris - could have been spend on developing the business. Managers have good technical skills, but very poor people skills.
Advice: Take care of your employees - this would benefit the company as well sine the turnover rate is extremely high and a lot of knowledge is lot and money spend every time a good employee leaves/burn out.
Pros: Steap learning curve, good colleagues, nice products

Cons: Not many cons to say, not any cons to say really, I believe if i were forced into saying a con it would be that "I wish they spoke to us more on a personal bases after the brandstorm was concluded, they really do seem like very fun people to talk to".
Advice: None
Pros: Before i talk about the pros and cons its very important to state that I havent worked within the company itself or ever was an integral part of the Loreal community (on a corporate bases), however, I did spend some time working with the representatives of loreal in order to come up with our brandstorm. PROS: Amazing people, they give you a sense of an unbelievably fun and dynamic environment, highly intelligent they really do know what theyre doing. Ended up second Place.

Cons: Work life balance does not exist

Senior Management has their own agenda for you, it doesn't matter what YOU want

The pay is TERRIBLE

Very competitive. stressful environment... backstabbing people
Advice: Stop treating your talented, high potential people badly or they won't leave to go work someplace else. Maybe you should consider what is best for them sometimes and NOT about your own agenda all the time. These are people and they want to be happy at their jobs.
Pros: Great Experience in that I learned a great deal while I was there. Great preparation for going to another company, because if you can make it a few years at L'Oreal, you can make it ANYWHERE! Everything else is a breeze after you spend a few years there

Benefite were good and good perks (product, etc..)

Cons: Super Long working hours and operational messes that you are continuously clearing. It can get very tiring
Advice: The focus is always on the marketing side. Need to focus on other functions and empower them to build a more balanced work place
Pros: It's an open culture with a flat hierarchy. The company is very agile you are allowed to trial New things and even if it fails the Managment supports you and gives you a feedback. There are no fixed processes hence you can bring about any kind of change. If you are an asset and a performer you are exposed to the TOP leadership. Also they tend to load everything to the person who does most the work that to me was an opportunity to learn so much

Cons: Above everything else, L'Oreal is exceptional at sales - selling the product to customers, selling "opportunities" to new employees, and especially selling a certain type of delusion to everyone who works there.



Here are the main difficulties I faced while working at L'Oreal:



-3 out of 5 senior and mid-level managers are generally unequipped for the role



This means a lack of understanding of what it means to manage in a professional sense (setting objectives, defining role scope and responsibility, removing roadblocks, etc), but what's more concerning, is that a lot of management is unequipped for the role emotionally - with no ability to empathize or understand the needs of the subordinates, they are followed only because the employees have to follow them.



-Ego + Politics &gt; Merit + Results



I vividly recall my manager obsessing over the most insignificant details on a powerpoint deck, only to ensure that when he or she presents it to upper management, she is seen as a "superstar". I also recall manipulating the data to make a failed launch look "good", just so my manager could have good news to share. There is a general preference for ignoring data-driven decisions in favour of whatever makes the manager in question look good.



-Emotional abuse



It is a regular occurrence to see co-workers cry. It's even more commonplace to have a vacant role on any given team because the employee is on "sick leave" aka "stress-leave" aka "burn-out". The scary part is that no one is bothered by either of the above because they happen so frequently. 



-Hardcore cool-aid culture



There is a strong expectation that everyone who works at L'Oreal must absolutely love it all the time, never mention anything negative, and ALWAYS show intentions of staying at the company until retirement. If you as much as mention that you might have an interest in perhaps exploring another industry or company way down the line, you will be told to keep quiet as it will damage your career progression. The ironic part is that L'Oreal Canada has by far the highest turnover rate in the industry, and forcing employees to always pretend to be "loving the experience" only makes it more difficult to get to the root cause of the problems.



-Lack of ethical backbone



I can't disclose any details relating to product development for legal reasons, but there are a lot of very questionable products both from an efficacy stand-point as well as from the consumer positioning standpoint.
Advice: Without sounding like a broken record - please take off your L'Oreal-tinted glasses and assess the state of the company objectively. The issues I mentioned have been voiced hundreds of times over the years and no one has done anything about it. You know what the problems are, you just need to choose to resolve them.
Pros: The positives include:



-Lots of free and discounted product

-Young/fun co-workers

-Nice office following the most recent round of renovations

-Good mentorship available if you seek it out

Cons: Senior Management visits from Paris are a unhelpful.  Senior Managers from Paris can be aggressive and quite the divas but this is also changing.

The office is quite crammed and old.  It is not representative of a glamorous beauty company.

Not many British senior managers.
Advice: Continue the change you started.  You are doing a brilliant job.  Please invest in the office.
Pros: Fast paced, early responsibility, very entrepreneurial for a big company.  Best portfolio of brands in the industry.

Inspiring leadership. UK MD comes from a different company and is very approachable.  He is really transforming the company into a modern business.  

Despite the intensity of the job, the new Work Smart program allows a lot of flexibility to balance work and life

Cons: There can be a bit of an old school management style in certain pockets, but they're putting huge amounts of effort into changing this
Advice: In the context of change and improvement, don't lose the essence of what makes us L'Oréal!
Pros: If you want space to move, autonomy, freedom and big learning opportunities then L'Oréal is the place for you. You genuinely get out what you put in. It's fast-paced and high-energy and you're surrounded by highly intelligent and inspiring people to help you make it happen. Every year at L'Oréal feels like five years of learning that you'd get elsewhere. The learning & development is world class too, with an array of apps, MOOCs and more to keep you at the cutting edge.

Cons: Work life balance can lead to some problems in the long run - but I've found this at other companies as well.  They demand excellence but if you cant run fast enough, you're in trouble.
Advice: Seems as if HR plays a large role in the way that people are promoted.  If you don't know how to play the game, then you can be left behind.  Might be something to watch.
Pros: L'Oreal Canada is among the best I've seen or worked at.  Complete autonomy on the job, great training, practical experience, and one hell of a team to work with.  Compensation is great and they give you all the room in the world to run.  Phenomenal company.

Cons: You need to be on your game all the time, and the pace of action is very fast.
People change jobs very frequently so you're always building new relationships which, whilst stimulating, can slow down progress.
French culture takes time to understand. 
The london office is very tired and needs updating. The executive offices are beautiful, reflecting the brands. Everyone else works in cramped spaces at ugly desks.
Advice: There are too many priorities. Focus more.
Pros: The pay & benefits are slightly above average, not the best, but good. You get rewarded for achievement.
The business is so varied that you can have a whole lifetime career with L'Oreal and never get bored.
It's a fast-moving, entrepreneurial culture with empowerment for anyone who wants to take it.

Cons: the benefits take many time to be with you since their hire you. 

The day I stared working with them was august 3th and today still waiting for the gas for my car and the vales for supermarket. Also for the parking lot, my refunds and some other things that I have to use to complete my work in the way they told me that will occur it is not happening.
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of information, friendly website with useful tools and programs. 

They try to help you personal and professional career with courses and programs but they don't teach you how to use them or how to access to them and it is not always easy.

It's a multicultural company so you can see diferent people and work with diferent cultures.

Cons: Too much politics slow down processes and initiatives. Such a big and successful company, that´s often ends up being too conservative, and not that innovative.  Salary not that competitive. 12 hours shifts very often.
Advice: As said
Pros: The Beauty business is inspiring, fascinating and challenging. Working as a Brand development manager on start up brands at L'Oreal, offers a rich experience on many different fields: From Marketing, to Education, PR, Digital and sales, experiencing both the Selective and the Professional medical channel. Dealing with different business models form a perfumery open sales one to the department store, from a  free standing store retail  business to the launch of your own e-commerce. Finally relationships with colleagues is an additional  reason to keep standing the cons.

Cons: You have to work under fast pace environment and sometimes you might be stressed if you could not manage the timeline of your tasks well. Many people are working until very late to catch up with tight deadlines.
Advice: Everyone in the company is super busy especially the management team. You may not be able to get timely feedback and evaluation from the management team.
Pros: L'Oréal is the world leading skin care & cosmetics company and you will be able to observe the operation of this big multi-national company. You could understand how a beauty brand works under cooperation of marketing & sales team. And more importantly, you could learn time management, multi-tasking and practical analytical skills. Good experience.

Cons: - The worst leadership team with unclear direction. They are aggressive and far from inspiring. 

- Toxic culture. Hilarious that rather than change the culture they just deny it and cover up the faults with dedicated weeks for D&amp;I, leadership etc. Yet they don't implement these core principles. 

- Motivation is based on fear rather than ambition. You can feel the tension in meetings. 

- Hierarchal and political. Be prepared to play the game. 

- Disrespectful and nasty employees

- Unforgiving and do not allow for mistakes

- Managers are clueless about managing. They need to be trained to support

- Thankless job

- There's always someone looking to throw you under a bus

- Bullying culture

- It's not about quality,  It's about making things look pretty and getting ahead
Advice: None
Pros: Find the amazing people who aren't 'L'Oréal' types. There are few, but hold on to them when you find them! They keep you sane. 



-

Cons: No transparency between management and lower levels and work life balance is non-existent if you want to move up the corporate ladder quickly.
Advice: If you want to retain your top talent encourage work life balance and walk the walk.  Don't ask for the sky all the time as you will burn your employees as they are the most dynamic and talented teams I have ever worked with.
Pros: If you are motivated, smart and creative you will move up fast within the company learning very quickly and gaining responsibility just as quickly.  Great place to begin you career.  Keep in mind it is probably the largest group of over achievers under one roof you will ever meet.

Cons: • "Fluid" management which leads to indecisiveness and lots of unnecessary back-and-forth – lack of clarity and direction.

• Political environment in brand marketing teams – high school all over again. Lots of bootlicking going on on a daily basis. Play the game or you lose.

• "Kids" (MTs turned Pdt Managers) who have not worked anywhere else think they know it all and act like their years of work in Loreal correlates to having more "power".

• Staff are constantly overworked and feel a need to ensure you "suffer" with them as well. If you don't buy into the "work over weekend" mentality, you are deemed not committed, not passionate, or not "Loreal-like".

• Terrible for middle managers, especially those outside of the Marketing scope as priority/consideration is always given to Brand teams. 

• Sorely lacking guidance and mentorship for support functions sitting in the Marketing team.

• Borderline workplace bullying with shouting matches and public shaming from peers.
Advice: • So much talk about Transformation and Ethics, yet not much is done to ensure your people follow through. 

• Support roles are hired to complement Marketing team, help them contribute successfully instead of de-prioritising these roles.  

• Stop encouraging high-school games by being clicque-y with bootlicking staff in the team –your job as a leader is to be inclusive and impartial. Playing favourites is damaging.

• Teach female managers and directors to keep their emotions and anger in check. Raising their voices or shouting in the office is not classy. People of management callibre should be more composed and poised than that.
Pros: • Decent staff allowance for quarterly goods across all 20+ brands

• Training opportunities for upskilling and regular workshops (by Google, Facebook etc)

• International mobility

• Good starting ground for Management Trainees due to fast-track career path

Cons: The work life balance was shocking for me. I worked very long hours and so did my superiors, even though most were married and had family. But looking back, overall the work was enjoyable and I gleaned a lot of satisfaction from seeing results first hand. I also learned a lot and was given incomparable levels of responsibility. I definitely don't regret my time here.
Advice: The younger employees needed more role models - someone to model their career after.
Pros: I was on the management trainee track at this company and as a previous reviewer notes, I would highly recommend that anyone entering this company do so this way. Though the initial interview process was grueling, I felt that I was given clear benefits and opportunities for training.

Cons: Sometimes the great amount of responsibility can mean long hours, but generally it is not anything outside the ordinary in comparison to other graduate schemes. A level of uncertainty in terms of jobs after the grad scheme is apparent.
Advice: None
Pros: You get real responsibility right from the off and you work on challenging projects that really make a difference to the business. 



A company where there is real relations between all levels of employees, you get exposure to senior management and are able to showcase your own work. 



A very sociable office culture where you can easily fit in and make a group of friends.



A huge amount of opportunity to learn and improve with a plethora of training courses available.

Cons: You work till late hours, first 2 years I worked till midnight, no much respect for personal life private life balance; company of chaos and confrontation culture. More you fight more you are successful.
Advice: It is important to respect to life/work balance of employees. In the country I worked, we used to work even on Sundays to prepare presentations for regional or headquarter teams visits.
Pros: They give you a lot of responsibilities even if you are at the beginning of your career. You learn fast and a lot. You learn a lot on how to create 360 campaigns, press launches are very important. You need to be on top of fashion, personal care trends.they recruit people from same background so when you work you make many friends also.

Cons: lack of work-life balance.

lack of mentorship unless one is french.

lack of training.

poor systems & processes.

lack of professional development.

lack of management concern for employees.

lack of enough people to do the work.

employees are not empowered.

majority of "people managers" are micromanagers.

constant revolving door of employees.

high level of employee dissatisfaction.

raises are less than cost of living.

employee bonuses are not given at 100% "target" level even if the company makes target levels of sales and profit.

high level of secrecy and poor communication.

too many meetings, no meeting minutes/agendas.

top management level needs to approve of any external hires (even if it is to fill an existing position where someone resigned) - this is Roze or below him that has to approve.
Advice: hire enough employees to do the expected work.

give managers training on how to be human and treat people like humans rather than robots.

less secrecy.

encourage open communications.
Pros: product discount

good name on resume

Cons: -There is no training at all so most of the times you need to figure out by your own how things are done. This can slow down a lot of processes. 

- Work-life balance culture is a mess. People never leave on time (sometimes they stayed until late night hours).

-Micro-managament gives less room for innovation and (also) slow things down.
Advice: -Empower and trust your employees to innovate more.

-Encourage work-life balance. The key to a successful business is happy employees. 

-Invest on training programs fro all levels and not only senior management.
Pros: -High paced environment where you learn a lot. 

-Opportunity to grow and move within the company. 

-Working in one of the biggest companies worldwide with well known brands.

Cons: - Organic culture. Lack of process makes for a lot of rework and mixed responsabilities.

- HR with weak presence and power. Carreer is too dependant on bosses.

- Work involves strategic thinking and a lot of operational. Lack of processes makes operational load too heavy.

- Empowerement is so strong it is always your fault when something goes wrong.
Advice: - Create clearer business objectives to drive performance and ownership.

- HR should evolve to a less "corporate" style into a people development department.

- Flexibility is good, complete lack of process/system is not.
Pros: - Strong innovation spirit

- Creative culture full of rich exchanges

- Build your own carreer: result driven corporation. People that make the difference will be able to grow. From interns to directors.

- Drive for excellence.

Cons: - lack of processes / very disorganized

- "too many cooks": big ordeal to get anything approved and slow time to market because of constant inputs from various heads with different opinions

- poor communication (employess are often the last to know about big changes happening and are left wondering, since there's no clear strategy/input that's passed on to them)
Advice: - less expats, more locals: most of the time we are left with top management that knows they'll only stay for 3-4 years, so they have no interest in building a solid foundation. They build short-term plans, for short-term results...and not always the best decisions for long-term growth
Pros: - ownership of projects

- ease of implementation of new ideas/processes

- diverse & creative environment

- great people

Cons: I first want to firmly that everything I say in here it's true. This is my experience working at the Montreal downtown office in 2018-2019:



Everyone has a feeling that something's "not right" with the work environment. The turnover rate is very high to begin with, and people working until 10pm is not unusual.



They talk openly about ethics and diversity but they don't practice what they preach. It's all just for show to attract young talent. They mostly hire straight out of college because they are inexperienced with how toxic work environments are and they usually put up with it.



I was pushed by a senior manager and HR to work the 10-plus-hour days without complaint. I tried to explain many times that it was detrimental to my mental health and my relationship at home but they defended the "L'Oreal culture" and said it had to do with the "competences" they wanted to see if I ever wanted to get a promotion. I remember feeling sad and depressed but they reprimanded me for not being grateful to be working there. As a disciplinary measure they extended my probation period and I wasn't eligible for a salary increase since then.



When a coworker found me crying in the bathroom she said "Don't worry, I have seen so many people crying here at L'oreal". We even have a term for it at the office: "Burnout Leave".



Besides that, I also witnessed strange incidents such as:



-Black female employees are the less likely to have their contracts renewed and many of them are "subcontractors" which means they get paid less than permanents and don't receive any benefits despite working in the same office.



-A female top manager had to take an extended medical leave after a very stressful period at work and when she came back she was already replaced by a male co-worker.



I worked here for two years and never felt it was safe to go to HR or management when I had issues.
Advice: Be more aware about the toxic environment, it encourages situations such as racism and discrimination to go unnoticed!
Pros: Discounted products at the boutique

Cons: Company is extremely political, work needs to be constantly redone before having to be approved by all the hierarchy. Long working hours, without the feeling you are being valued for it. Good start salary but low yearly increases across the company due to poor sales performance in the last years.
Advice: Stop the old, hierarchical, "devil wears prada" style management. You need to empower your employees and value their work. Secret alliances, special treatments and irrational behavior doesn't create a healthy and productive work environment
Pros: Autonomy at work, hands-on and challenging projects. Less structures sometimes means opportunity for more ideas (not that they are always taken into account). Interesting and intelligent co-workers. Good for resume.

Cons: The only downside at working for L'Oréal is the missing balance between work and life. Personally I missed a company gym, or a company caféteria (there is a very small one). Mireover I would appreciate more facilitating internal organizsations for young mothers.
Advice: None
Pros: Very nice community. Despite the clustering into different brands, the communication across the different brands is great. People are quite young on average, which increases the likelihood of similar interests. L'Oréal is said to be a tough school - and it is. Aside from passion, it requires a high level of self-motivation. Employees that switch to different employers after some years, are grateful for the experiences they have made during their time at L'Oréal.

Cons: Very hierarchal  

Not a very diverse organisation

Ruled from Paris, if you want to advance your career you have to factor in a period of time there

Badly trained managers
Advice: Root out the bad managers and dead wood - there's quite a lot of it. You need to have more operating model reviews so people don't get too comfortable in their roles. Having people in the same roles for over 5 years is wrong and you lose good talent because they're blocking promotions
Pros: Work with great brands

Great name to have on your CV

If you can survive a few years here you can work anywhere

Cons: Everything changes so fast, including your manager, that will implement on the changing system and policy also. If you can adjust to changes, you definitely can fit. Sometimes the products just don't match with the local need, but you have to sell it anyway.
Advice: Put the best man in your strategic places, not only because they are French.  Local people can be trusted to know their own market, sometimes it difficult to foreigner to understand the local market, especially for DMI who never stay long in that country.
Pros: Great friends and ambience. We had the "work hard and play harder" motto for sure. No boundaries beetween bosses and their subordinate. Encourage to think outside the box.

Cons: unprofessional rsm ,

worked in loreal ppd , this wing is just ok

heavy work , moderate pay , just the brand name , absolutely nothing is interesting here



Training is a joke , if u are a bde ,, The attitude of buddies are intolerable , they think they bring the business ,repeating same bi heart classes again and again,they tend to think they are real professional trainer - 



altogether very boring ,, job becomes irritating because of the reason sales person has to also look the job of buddy barbers,nothing exciting
Advice: remove this r buddy system in ppd, it is a headache and nightmare for every sales guy, buddattitude is  intolerable , good people leaving due to unprofessional managers, 



all best to the brand , what a lovely incredible brand!!!!!
Pros: infratrcuture good

 Hr team is good ,., They are world class no doubt.good, Respected brand.

Cons: very strong company culture of seniority and loyalty. Sometimes performance is overlooked in favour of seniority for promotions. Sometimes you may encounter an incompetent boss. It wont last for more than a year for sure but 6 months is minimum. those 6 months might be extremely frustrating.
Advice: none. the management has done a wonderful job in this rapidly expanding enterprise.
Pros: faster growth than many of my peers. salary raised by more than 50% in 1.5 years. A wonderful learning experience with great interaction with seniors and experts in the field. Atmosphere is amazing for a young person to cultivate dynamism and energy.

Cons: - hierarchical organisation, need to use the lines of hierarchy to get things done

- sometimes get a bit lost in details, instead of looking at the bigger picture (but this is inherent to the beauty/fashion business I guess)
Advice: - empower your employees even more to run their projects and fail at some times

- listen more to your employees to stop the high rate of turnover
Pros: - entrepreneurial spirit, room to create things yourself

- innovation at the core, products but also communication model (as of lately)

- young, ambitious colleagues

- lots of responsibilities from the beginning 

- great learning school how to work with people, partners and to get marketing at a very broad level

Cons: Unsustainable workload (particularly in the marketing brand teams) with extremely stretched thin resource. Especially during the beauty “bounce back” after Covid-19. This leads to frustration, low team morale, regular burn-out and always feeling like you are firefighting rather than getting ahead.
Advice: The only way to improve colleague stress is to reduce workload and increase headcount. It’s nice to have wellness programmes but ultimately the only way to shift the dial is to change those two things above.
Pros: Fantastic, inspiring work colleagues

Forward thinking ways of working (though not 100% there yet)

Fun social perks

Great employee benefits 

Free products

Sense of pride and admiration for working for an amazing beauty company. A family team feel.

Cons: Decisions must always go up the entire chain of command before any action can be taken.

Superiors do not groom their subordinates for advancement.

Too many employees who have done the same job for many years. Leaves a lack of passion and open-mindedness to new procedures or ways of accomplishing tasks.
Advice: Work on allowing growth and experimentation within the ranks of middle management. Develop a sense of partnership within the company. The lack of upward mobility in various areas of the company prevents upper management from grooming their direct reports for higher level work.
Pros: Well respected brands.

High regard for quality.

Solid portfolio of brands and products. Well diversified across various price points.

Forward-thinking in some of the benefits offered.

Cons: Be ready to work way more than 40hr/week.

You're just a number and they remind you every day that you can easily be replace.

Judgmental environment, people backstab each others and trash talk to get promoted

High % of depression, burn out, etc.
Advice: If someone leaves on a burn out, don't give his or her job to someone else who'se alrwady working more than 60hr per week. This person will eventually leave on a burn out too. Just hire someone on a contract to help out you employees.
Pros: Good salary and incentives

Possibility to advance within the company

Prestige of the brand

Glamorous environment

Cons: Absolutely no work life balance. You can never work too hard

Lack of leadership

Turnover is like no other place

Too many meetings. Nothing can move forward without a series of meeting

Decision making is a huge issue

Lack of creativity and innovation

Upper Management is fully disconnected from employees, even at high levels

Many employees are unprepared for the positions they hold

One year non-competition agreement is unrealistic

Very few employees over the age of 45 

Recruitment is problematic; it takes months to replace vacant positions
Advice: This is where the problem is. Management is leading by force with little to no understanding of what is truly happening within the company. Moral is at the lowest in years and employees are resigning left and right. Recruiting new employees is difficult; a lot of people refuse to join due to the company's reputation and the new non-competition agreement.
Pros: Excellent benefits

Good portfolio of mass brands

Offices are pleasant, well located

Cons: Very cut throat, competitive environment. It wasn't as big of a deal in my position, but for account managers sales meetings are a nightmare. You can expect to get called out and quizzed on your numbers. Very poor work/life balance



Few opportunities outside of NY/NJ



Attitude by management. Former President of our division was a total diva. Top management of L'Oreal USA is also always brought in from France.
Advice: Lose the attitude, create a more team oriented environment.
Pros: Amazing benefits - company car, 3 weeks vacation, free and discounted product, worked from home (for field teams), summer hours (for corporate office)



Lots of learning and training opportunities. Generally nice and supportive people.

Cons: Unachievable sales goals, management not respectful of your days off, they expect you to take the calls even though they are off on weekends and are unavailable to take calls. Not alot of ability to move up or progress in your career unless you work in the head office in Montreal. They keep giving the upper management more work instead of promoting employees. Some managers have 3 or 4 job titles.
Advice: Please give credit where credit is due. Give part time workers benefits and show appreciation for the employees who are working for you
Pros: 4 weeks of vacation, global profit sharing, stock options, bonus pay, heath benefits and comprehensive care and share program. Workplace stability.

Cons: Extremely cliquey culture depending which division you work in - much worse in some teams than others. Lots of contractors who have zero protection or benefits even after working for L’Oréal for 5-6 years, due to “lack of headcount” - a very unethical practise in my opinion which affected many people during COVID.
Advice: None
Pros: Great team ethos if you work in the right kind of department. Potential to grow and move into various roles if you have a good manager dedicated to your career progression. L’Oréal run many events throughout the year catering to awareness of different topics, and they are relatively good at taking employee feedback on board.

Cons: Does not always reward merit or loyalty

Weak Talent Management Or career progression processes 

Very very few opportunities to move to roles outside the country below Senior Leadership levels

Not the best pay-master in the industry

Not the best ecosystem to learn commercial processes as not a deep-distributed organization.

No processes to ensure parity or balance between grades basis job profile or experience. Majorly manually driven and Subjective on this front.
Advice: None
Pros: Strong Marketing Ecosystem

Very Strong brands with global pedigree

Smaller organisation and hence tighter knit

Very strong focus on Ethics and Diversity

Not very rigid so easier to implement ideas or take decisions

Very good learning opportunity on top-of-pyramid channels like Modern Trade and Ecommerce

Cons: 1) No regard for work-life balance
2) Usually under-pay compared to competition
3) Compensation levels not consistent for the same role. Discrimination very common in compensation levels
4) Management attitude not to the standard of a global MNC
Advice: 1) Have a clear definition of what will be earned upon reaching a certain role. Lack of consistency in pay for those taking up a new role impacts motivation.
2) Facilitate work-life balance. 
3) Invest in "human". You call the company a "people-first" company.
4) Investment in tech development should not come at the cost of investment in people.
Pros: 1) Company invests in learning
2) Good co-workers (pre-pandemic)
3) Opportunity for growth
4) Immense learning opportunities
5) One of the biggest companies in the world

Cons: - Relatively poor work life balance with long hours often continuing into the night. 

- Can be very 'political' at times with many decisions being made due to 'the boss wants it this way'

- Pay is 'competitive', but not better than other companies offering similar roles 

- Management are slow to implement the deep changes necessary to secure and retain young talent.
Advice: Implement financial incentives and penalties for management based on teams feedback, to ensure change is adopted faster across the organisation.
Pros: - Invests in training for staff across multiple disciplines

- Chance to own your projects 

- Passionate colleagues

- Good career opportunities for top talent to move overseas with the company

Cons: - undervalued

- treated very differently to full time staff (treated as a contractor)

- expected to give ideas and pressured to do all the work but then not recognised when pulled off, praise is given to managers which can be demotivating

- very limited progression to graduate scheme with lots of pressure to do way over and above job role which is already a vast work load

- little support from HR as they are busy recruiting next interns
Advice: None
Pros: - real responsibility from day 1

- big project/brand involvement

- exposure to senior staff

- good hands-on experience for when moving onto other companies

- name looks good on CV

Cons: The organization is so complex that sometimes it is difficult to make things move

No process and no methodology

The salary in France is based on a package with a fix salary and a very important "intéressement+participation" (3 to 4 months of salary per year free of charges). The problem is that the fix is in general lower than in other companies.
Advice: Please take decisions and defend them
Pros: You build your own carrier at L'Oréal

There are still new fields to explore

This is a challenging world that can build a person and his carrier

There are a lot of business represented and with some bridges if you have talents.

Cons: Concentrated in Hair and Makeup categories. High competition among its own brands with lower margins
Advice: Improve by differentiating and separating innovation paths between brands (L'Oreal / Garnier / Maybelline). Minimize internal competition and avoid hurting financial margins. Define real blockbusters... Bigger, Fewer, Faster, Better (all new product seems to have same priority). Execution at the POS has lot of room for improvement. Increase beauty authority and presence at other personal care categories... e.g. Skin Care (Face & Body Lotions), Deodorants, Shower products, Femenine protection. Employees rotation between countries and brands is too high and fast... These creates no expertise.
Pros: Brand, Beauty authority, Innovation, Advertising

Cons: Change of management thus many changes and affected the morale of employees

Lack of strong middle management leadership

Expected employees to take on a lot of responsibilities which can be a stretch
Advice: Appreciate employees more especially those back-end or contract employees, not just those profit generating divisions
Pros: I have been working in L'Oreal Singapore for 5 years.

Working environment is fun and people are great to work with!

Definitely not a gossipy environment as some claimed.

Career Development is there if you ask for it

Will listen to employees' opinions and improved welfare to enhance work-life balance

Cons: This is a French company that operates as the French do.  It's very political, and hierarchical, and you do have to learn the politics to get ahead.  They always say you have to manage your own career at L'Oreal, and it's true.  You have to know what you want and learn exactly the right way to push, and who to become friends with - not everything is merit based.  And god forbid you ever show a bit of emotion - the masculine culture of L'Oreal manufacturing may come as a bit of a surprise, considering it's a cosmetics company.  There are no women past a certain level, so be aware that you can move forward quickly at the beginning, but you will probably have to get out after 6-7 years if you really want to move ahead.



The downside of quick responsibility is that they give you little-to-no training - it's all "on the job" training, but this is the L'Oreal way, and we have all come to accept it, even if we don't like it.



Finally, the "leadership" abilities of much of the management leaves much to be desired.  The top guys are between good and great, but there are a lot of people under them who don't really know how to manage... and I don't think L'Oreal has done a good job in correcting that yet.
Advice: Worry about the fact that even though L'Oreal was voted one of the top spots to start a career, it is consistantly not ranked above the top companies to work for.  Young people are willing to work hard and produce really good work, but when they see their peers, or their predecessors doing the same and still not getting rewarded just because they don't play the game exactly right, this is a problem.  At some point "experience" does not count as a part of compensation.  Finally, you hire smart people, but you don't trust them to do smart things.
Pros: Young, dynamic co-workers make it easy to have a social life, especially if you've moved from elsewhere.  There's something special about working for a company whose products you see on the shelf at the salon or in Target or even the make-up counter at Macy's.  They do give you a lot of responsability right off the bat, and if you continue to perform, you can move ahead, as long as you learn your way through the politics.  Finally, as long as you're performing well (average, even), your job is not at stake - L'Oreal holds onto its employees sometimes well after their expiration date, but this also gives you the chance to make mistakes and take risks without ruining your future.  If you don't fit in one position, they will try you out in another, because when they hired you, somewhere they saw a spark of something that they want to see shine.

Cons: - Very bureaucratic environment

- Poor management significantly impacts team morale

- Lack of upward mobility if you are unwilling to move to Montreal

- Communication between head office and field team is problematic; feedback from field teams is rarely leads to improvements in strategy

- They don't invest in the professional development of their employees
Advice: - Listen to your sales reps given that you emphasize the importance of gathering market intelligence that is communicated to head office

- Value your employees and take reasonable sources of job dissatisfaction as opportunities to improve your organization and reduce turnover
Pros: - Significant level of autonomy

- Flexible schedule

- Plenty of opportunities to be entrepreneurial in your territory

Cons: All about networking far more than performance, very competitive. Young leadership that needs to be shapped. Poor HR management with lack of undertsanding what leadership trully means (despite the country)
Advice: Please HR, be caring to your employees. Understand who your public is and enable them for what they can acutally become. Do not hinder people's growth due to your frustrations. Leaders...be mature before you aim to grow in your career, your knowhow and expertise has to match your emotional maturity, after all your first product is the peple you work with!
Pros: You will be very autonomy to create new procedure, millenials workstyle, awesome brands to work with

Cons: -Sad to see new talented wasted



-Never seen a company with such a high turnover EVER



-No one is really good at what they are doing because they are only in a position for a year or two (by choice, or not by choice)



-Better "play the game right" or be played --Seen too many employees leave because they just couldn't take it
Advice: Realize that new talent hired has more potential than the position given to them...



It is up to management to test their limits & set them up for failure or success.
Pros: -Energy

-Fresh Ideas (because of high turnover)

-Lots of position movement

-Lots of innovation

-Compensation

-Benefits

-Some AMAZING co-workers

Cons: The inequalities between the different divisions are alot. Office staff eat on glass and overall normal plates while factory staff eat on metal plates.

 Employees working on Loreal consumer products division have extremely high benefits compared to staff working on local products(which ironically sell more).

Extremely low salaries for interns, management trainees and those on contract.

Slow decision making.

Frequent resignations.

Few career growth opportunities for locals.
Advice: You have to make things more equal in Kenya. For the company to grow, discrimmination has to stop.

Make everyone feel as if the role they play in the company is valued.

Get more locals in high up positions as they understand East Africa more, especially in sales and marketing.
Pros: No dress code.

Open door policy.

Cons: Since there are some many interlocutors and speakers, it sometimes becomes hard to be quick and flexible to launch campaigns to the market. Also, it's a highly competitive environment with lots of business-related pressure, and it becomes quite hard to keep a work/life balance.
Advice: Need to simplify work processes: less meetings, more concese feedback, more analysis of results
Pros: Your managers trust you from the very first moment you start working at the company. You are entitled and responsible for your position and can easily get visibility to top management levels. It's easy to learn from cross-functional teams and, if you perform correctly, you are given the chance to grow in the company.

Cons: High Turnover and constant change of management in the company.  It gets tiring having to re-establish relationship with new managers, in 1 year you can have 2-3 different managers.  All the hard work you did to prove yourself with your previous manager can be wasted.  Because here, it doesn't matter what you did last month, what are you doing this minute?



LONG hours.  If there is an international visit be prepared to work weekends and late evenings.  Sometimes these visits are a surprise and they tell you to prepare in 2-3 weeks (mostly rare).  You end up preparing 100 different ppt. slides, 5 of which might actually be used.  The entire visit process is such a waste of time, you're basically putting on a big show for the big international bosses.  I haven't heard bad things about them, I've typically heard that they were pretty friendly, but it's just a waste of time.  Everyone is stressed out and running around like chickens with their heads cut off.   



Office Politics.  This is soo huge here.  Like the comment above, its all about putting on a show.  Making it seem like you're doing so much work and its amazing.  Everything is controlled by HR, and they are watching/analyzing you're every move. It's all about if they like you, performance has less to do than you would expect.  Lots of backstabbing.  But at first its so hidden, you don't realize anything once you have the rosy shades on from being so excited to get hired.  Then slowly you see cases where upper management suddenly vanishes from the company.  People will throw you under the bus to get ahead.  Poor value system.  Don't trust anyone!  Everyone is looking out for themselves.  



Logistics and IT sucks here.  You'd think that a company that is so cutting edge in innovation, they would invest more in their logistics management systems and operations.  Especially being a CPG giant.  Expect computers from the mid 19th century (kidding. but seriously: crappy IT).  It slows down your work, frustrating.  



Poor management (sometimes):  If you have a bad manager, all i say is GOOD LUCK! you can be the hardest working, most intelligent employee and if they don't like you, you're screwed.  If your manager doesn't know what they're doing, GOOD LUCK! this typical doesn't happen, but it does (i guess this is a risk at all companies)  But don't dare voice your opinions to HR, because their motto is "too bad, its your responsibility to deal with it"
Advice: Relax, it's just a stick of lipstick.  You're not curing cancer.
Pros: Discounted products

Great training opportunities in other cities (Paris, NYC)

The pride of telling people you work at L'Oreal

Opportunities for movement, both up or different brands

Good salary

Great opportunities for recent grads, MBA or otherwise

If you're in Marketing, this can be a really great company to work for because they spend a lot of $ on marketing

Amazing learning experience

A lot of responsibility early on in your career (if they like you)

Young crowd

innovative products 

lost of investment PR (luminato, tiff etc.)

Cons: difficult to have a working and private life balance, difficult to get support when you face difficulties with your line manager, difficult to evolve if you don't know the good person (lack of transparency in the career management sometimes)
Advice: Take the principle of managing with generosity as a value that has to guide your day to day business. Making line managers accountable for the way they manage their team in stead of taking only into account the quantifiable objectives set.
Pros: Multinational company that has a lot of mean to develop its staff, compensation and benefits, multiplicity of career paths, autonomy

Cons: Complete and utter disorganisation, hidden by 'being entrepreneurial'. I.E. Do what you want, and if it works, pat on the back, but if it doesn't, I would have some stitches ready to patch up the knife wound lodged in your back (metaphorically speaking).



I can see the company are trying to make it a nice environment for their staff, such as implementing agile working hours (something that has been in the industry for about 15 years already in other companies), but it just doesn't work. 

People at the top of L'Oreal are far too stubborn, old school, and don't believe in change. Therefore, if you dare work from home, which is the new policy, I wouldn't bank on getting a promotion anytime soon.

In my opinion, the only way L'Oreal is going to become a top place to work is if they get a good old sweeping brush, and have a good clean out of old management at the top, to then bring in fresh thinkers who are not brainwashed by the old school French power house that rule the roost.
Advice: Go on an training course at a company like Google or another top place to work FMCG company (check the times top places to work for inspiration), take all the learnings you can from what they do, and then implement it at L'Oreal. 

Sounds easier said than done, but there is no other business in the industry that has a higher staff turn over than L'Oreal.

They must be doing something right, and L'Oreal must be doing something wrong.
Pros: Great business experience due to a lot of responsibility. You are basically put under that much pressure that you are forced to learn at a rapid pace. Great if you want to go on the apprentice.

People are brilliant though, and you can have a great laugh.

Cons: Where to begin... The teams are extremely low on headcount, to the point where flexible/home working had to be brought in a few years ago and this has been readily jumped to try and escape 60 hour weeks (which were and still are the norm). I've had colleagues who have constructively complained about the working hours effectively managed out of the company for being "inefficient". Everyone knew what was happening so it just meant that people stopped complaining about the workload. Unfortunately the one's managed out for inefficiency (not me) tended to be the 'nice guys/girls'.



The working environment is very cut throat. Individual teams seem to work well but cross team working is difficult as everyone is trying to come up with the best idea (and then take the credit). NAMs, SNAMs etc not only have to do their own jobs but are also organised into 'brand teams', which are essentially trade marketing roles. This is all extra work on top of your day job (whether you look after Tesco or Poundland it's the same). Writing presentations on the way to customer meetings was normal because you just couldn't find the time due to all the internal priorities. These 'brand teams' go some way to explain the extra 20ish hours everyone does each week that is unpaid.  



Talking of pay, it's low for the industry. NAMs start somewhere around the late £30's to mid £40's, and SNAMs are in the early £40's to low £50's sort of range. When you add in the long working hours, which means on average you're earning somewhere around the £13 - £16 per hour range as a SNAM, you have to question whether your life and investment in your education has been worth it for that, particularly being based in London.



The final thing I will add is that when I decided to leave and was interviewing I had to defend the fact that I had worked at L'Oreal to 2 different companies that I interviewed with, which was surprising. L'Oreal workers are seen as arrogant by the wider FMCG companies and I found myself having to say in interviews that I was not the typical L'Oreal employee in order to show that I would fit in with their company cultures.
Advice: Try to give your sales teams more choice in what they do in terms of commercial planning - having a junior product manager telling a SNAM or Business Controller what to do in this field will only ever lead to conflict.



Remember that you're employing a young team who do actually want to experience London life during the week.



Think retention! The churn rate at L'Oreal is ridiculous and it feels like people are leaving every other week.
Pros: - Product discounts and adhoc staff sales

- Given responsibility early on

- Open plan team seating, very few behind glass doors

Cons: No chance to earn money. The salary is twice low, than the competitors propose.  Talent development  is absolutely undeveloped: any training, any real support from HR .
Advice: It' s time to become more people oriented. During last 2-3 years company lost a lot of talented professionals. Thanks God L'Oreal brand is strong enough to sell him self. But today real iconic Brand has to shine in all facets, to be unconditionally perfect.
Pros: Exclusive opportunity for the students to start carrier. It's good to get "L" in the first line of the CV. Great payed marketing internship and possibility to understand how is modern international FMCG business works.

Cons: - High turnover (never a good sign). 

- On average, 1 person quits every month.

- Business model is based on very young workers (right out of college) taking management positions to keep salaries to a bare minimum, therefore the only real decision makers are the Directors. 

- Most employees earn 60% less than average market salaries in Panama across the board (sales, marketing, etc.).

- Indecisive and bureaucratic upper management.

- Ugly company culture (long hours, horrible bratty bosses, sucking up is rewarded, very political and highly hierarchical)

- Absolutely no work-life balance.

- No real respect for the local culture, since all upper managers are expats.

- Locals are considered the "help" and not really considered for anything other than lower status jobs.
Advice: None.
Pros: - Nice location of main office.

- Good school to learn sales, marketing, supply and then get out within 2 years.

Cons: - Very little room to progress

- High employee turnover

- Unforgiving French culture

- People were scared to be seen leaving before 6pm

- Interns regularly in tears

- Horrific work/life balance unless you work in demand planning/supply chain

- Bottleneck hierarchy

- Extremely disorganised

- If you don't speak French, don't bother!
Advice: Treat people how you would like to be treated.  There were only a handful of people who I admired for their management style, as the rest either embodied micro-management to the extreme, or none whatsoever
Pros: - Free products

- Huge amount of responsibility

- Most of the workforce are really young

- Canteen was generally good

- Post room staff are the best, so be nice to them!

Cons: The team sizes are small which leads to a bit of more workload per person but at the same time, it gives you opportunities to learn a lot of different things.
Advice: None
Pros: The company is really employee friendly. Working here has helped bring out my creative side in make-up. Management takes care of you in all possible ways. The project I am pursuing in the internship is a real time problem faced by L'Oréal. My inputs are evaluated and sometimes they are implemented. This shows how much importance they give to summer internship program. By working on this, I can implement various concepts which I studied in MBA in real time.

Cons: Too agile, no career progression/ development planned. People come and leave in 2-3 years, taking with them entire knowledge on brand with no cross training for the junior ones. Mid management are then hired but they bail in half a year due to poor work life balance and this expectation that you’re hired to solve a problem with little to no context.
Advice: More for loreal to grow in having structured communications for new-comers, taking over database without any handover. Most importantly to plan for career opportunities and development, high turnover rate isn’t helping business urgencies or morale.
Pros: Young culture. Lively workplace. Trendy topics

Cons: I took a managerial position in sales for a short time, then decided to quit. In L'Oreal your career depends not on your professionalism, but on your relationship with management. Whether they like you or not. Criticism is not welcome, you have to say that all is fine, even if it is not so. Speaking French means a lot too. Top managers do not care to answer your mails, business processes are not structured.

I worked in Ukraine, maybe in the L'Oreal USA the situation is different.
Advice: Respect your employees. Aren't we worth it?
Pros: International company with a name. A lot of products are given free to the employees.

Cons: All brands have become homogenized into "L'Oreal" no point of difference.  Workers are expected to produce more with less.  The culture is no longer one of elevating talent, but one of pointing fingers.
Advice: Being number one doesn't mean you can continue as you always have.  You have to get out of NY and know what the competition is doing.  The old business model needs refreshing.
Pros: Good benefits, name brands easily recognized.  Built invaluable connections with co-workers in the beauty industry.  Great family of products.

Cons: sometime you need to butter your senior to get recognize, not an equal opportunity employer, in some cases HR dept is very poor in taking decisions . HR hardly do  anything to develop people .
Advice: when you have loyal people working with you for a long time you should give proper dues ,recognition and attention  to them and should understand  their sentiments....

If I got one more chance i would definatly join Loreal Again as Loreal is my First Love
Pros: Nice working environment to work with ,great leaders ,great brands image and where your ideas work,strong marketing team ,

Cons: In terms of logistics - the products by big cosmetics brands owned by L'Oreal often only reach New Zealand months after their release in the USA or overseas.
Advice: None
Pros: The managers, from your Area Manager to everyone in the head office who you will communicate with, are so friendly, supportive, helpful and efficient. They are fair, give positive and encouraging feedback as well as constructive criticism (without making it personal). I enjoyed the training and learning about the history of my brand too - it helps to really cultivate a genuine passion within the company! Best employer I have had so far.

Cons: - Average salaries around 60% vs. other CPG companies.

- It is an 'organic culture'. You need to be comfortable with doing a LOT of work, by yourself, navigate ambiguity and lack of guidance.

- Long and slow growth path to senior management.

- Harsh culture, very independent. Not very collaborative. Senior Management is tough.
Advice: None
Pros: - Biggest beauty company in the world. It is the leading place to start a career in beauty.

- Amazing resources to work with.

- 'Organic' culture. There are not many processes and you have freedom to pursue creative plans, without much burocracy, within certain limits.

- Perks! Tons of beauty products for free or discounted.

Cons: With anything challenging things take time and effort. Expect to work long hours, especially during peak periods. You will be pushed and sometimes stressed but its worth it.
Advice: Modernize outdated and archaic software to more user friendly alternatives. This will improve productivity and help modernize the workforce.
Pros: I've been with L'Oreal for a little over a year now and honestly love working here. My colleagues are smart, competent and hard working. The environment is fast paced and challenging but employees are given every opportunity to  excel and succeed. If you are motivated and ambitious you'll likely really enjoy working here... especially if you have an entrepreneurial spirit.

Cons: If you raise an issue against your team or management, you’re immediately forced to leave the company.  
As a brand who speaks of equality and fairness, they’re quick to brush issues under the carpet especially serious issues such as bullying. 
Staff shop is awful, the products are never available or majority of the stock isn’t even there. Shipping costs crazy amounts. 
No compassion in regards to employees personal life.
Advice: Everyone has flaws, INCLUDING management. Instead of getting rid of those who speak up, listen to them and help improve the working environment. It’s not just “retail”, it’s where we spend a lot of our days and deserve to be understood and respected. Regardless of our job title.
Pros: The pay is good 
Training provided is useful

Cons: It was hard work in Big bazaar bcoz of their such rules but i m glad that i have passed those things nd make my self a part of Brand staff I can say proudly that i have been working in loreal since 2 years
Advice: I looking forword to good company where i can learn nd achieve my goals
Pros: You will learn so much, How we should stand how we should talk, how can we understand customer needs nd want, how can easily convert a shopper to consumer

Cons: - due to fast-paced nature of business, guidance is often lacking making work a lot harder (need to place much greater emphasis on creating clear systems and processes)

- very results driven (understandable) but often feel like individual guidance is a side thought.

- long hours
Advice: Encourage managers to place more emphasis on people rather than results - results come when there is transparency and people feel valued, take the time to iron out systems/processes early - will save time in the long run
Pros: - Great setting to start your career, thrown into the deep end early on 

- lots of great people 

- good perks: summer hours, generous product allowance

Cons: When I went back into a casual role after being made redundant it was like I no longer existed. It took 10 weeks for me to get a Christmas casual contract and then another 5 weeks to get a regular casual contract despite being a loyal employee for years prior.
Advice: None
Pros: I worked at L’Oréal as both a manager and a casual. When i was a store manager I got a lot more support from the area managers and head office. The other L’Oréal staff were also amazing and fun to work with and there were some awesome work benefits with a great range of free products.

Cons: Very individualist complany. French people lead and always will. French language is a must to grow in the company. Top Manager are excellent is few skills and are placed in places that suite those skills. The company doen not look for complete managers, just for people able to deliver in a specific area. Extremely long working days
Advice: Focus on key priorities. Lot's of time wasted in useless details. top management quality at local level very poor
Pros: Exellence is a must, you will learn how not to compromise and how to look for the best. Challenging enviroment enables you to cope with pressure.

Cons: Not sure if it is a great place to grow and settle down but if you have an opportunity to work there, don't miss it. The salaries are still below the business benchmark. Home office does not exist in their vocabulary.
Advice: Home office, guys. I think we are the only company of our market which do not do home office. Salaries could be much better, that's why most of the people I know have left.
Pros: It is a great place to learn and develop. It is always changing. There's international mobility. It is a very inclusive company, one of its values is diversity.

Cons: I didn't learn anything valuable outside the company. I was constantly asked to fix small things. Few real responsibilities. They simply hire interns to do jobs that no one wants to do, like write emails and call creative agency to ask them to do small changes to commercials (i.e. make it bold, please more blue...)

As in any marketing department that is not the headquarter, there is no strategic view. It's pure operational marketing: execution of what Paris decides. People are stressed to  execute things that someone else decided and they scream at you too often.

Inefficient processes and old systems.
Advice: Create a Corporate Culture. Innovate processes (you are not really digital if you only use social media). Offer yoga classes to Group product managers
Pros: Exposure to all firm's functions and see complexity of a multinational company.

Cons: No career or development plans. You are being pushed to whatever job they can find, as long as it is hassle free for them. Some of my friends got even lower rank jobs (yet with the same salary) because "nothing else was available" at the time. 

Changing divisions is always challenging and almost impossible for people if you come from active cosmetics or worse, the professional products division. Top jobs often end up being given to CPD or Luxe employees. 

People who work their way up the corporate ladder are usually the ones that waited long enough and built the right connections, and avoided all the bullets. Performance reviews are a joke: you can demonstrate consistent performances year on year and still being left aside if you do not have sponsors. Darwinism at its best: if a top guy does not like you and you deliver a poor presentation just once, your career progression will come to a halt. I missed a promotion once for the sole reason that the head of the division "did not like me" although my track record was flawless and my line manager and the team leader both sponsored me. 

Still a lot of toxic managers too, some of them being clearly protected by top management. One HRD told me once that "X can't be removed because he/she is protected by the CEO". 

Most of the people getting promoted fit the same description. I can always tell who gets promoted in any team: the highly extroverted, self confident, risk taker, action oriented type. Don't try to be a strategic thinker in this company, or boast your "soft skills" or your 'inclusive" management style. What they like is the charismatic egocentric superman/woman type who can turnaround any situation on his own. 

They do try to change the corporate culture but the guys fostering it are the same guys who contributed to building what was deemed a toxic workplace 10 years ago.

The annual employee survey is now part of every manager's KPI: however,I have heard stories of teams being pressurized to deliver positive feedbacks in exchange of career advancement although this is hopefully rare. 

Finally, the learning in L'Oreal is not as good as the company claims: most of the training is now done online with random classes that are usually poor in content apart from a few MOOC that they advertise a lot. Personal development programs like coaching are reserved for senior management.
Advice: Build real career plans. Empower HR and stop promoting the same archetype of managers that thrive thanks to their networking abilities and interpersonal skills more than their actual performances.  Remove the passionate and emotional judgements from performance reviews with clear and objective KPI's. Change all the senior staff who built a toxic workplace and now slows down the cultural shift.
Pros: Great brands, lots of smart people, some of them being extremely friendly although they usually do not last long in the organization.

Cons: No worklife balance, 

L'Oreal recruits people from high education background in prestigious universities, the elite, but asks them to act like sheeps, 

interns do not get  hired even if they work crazy hours for months, 

very authoritarian environment, you cannot criticize management

Very competitive environment
Advice: treat nicely and fairly your employees, use more meritocracy, balance your life, show more respect to people in general (business partners, colleagues, customers...)
Pros: Good pay, good products for free, very young, good looking and "cool" employees, good to have that company name on your resume

Cons: Even if you ace the ratings,  you can't beat the colleague who sucked up and got fast tracked. Pay scale is hardly competent although HR keeps screaming from the roof tops that we are market aligned.
Advice: To have your favourites is human,  but at least be aware of true talent that exists in your midst. Stop discouraging the hard workers.
Pros: Opportunities to learn are galore. Work culture is what you make of it,  but it's fun and stressful.  Performance gets rated for target achievement as well as networking.

Cons: - Things move slower than most places.

- The different divisions are still very separated.
Advice: Cultivate more cross-divisional collaboration and knowledge sharing - digital is leading the way on this. My only other advice is to keep up the fantastic work.
Pros: + Everyone here is driven. It's great to be with other motivated people.

+ The company ACTUALLY cares about its people - compared to wanting to look like it cares.

+ Even in the busiest of times you're never too overwhelmed. Enabled through management initiatives and your working environment.

+ We live and breathe beauty.

+ Ethics isn't a buzz word. This comes out in everything we do.

Cons: - The culture nurtured by the leaders (especially the one who's been there for long time) is very political and very bossy. The way the senior managers communicate is very top down with sometimes disrespectful attitude

- It's not so transparent, guys from french came to local office just to be served with presentation and market visit. They didn't communicate anything to local office and just make their own "gang"
Advice: None
Pros: - Strong business fundamentals due to the presence in the categories that are complementary and relatively strong growth 

- Great brands 

- Positive outlook due to the strong presence in emerging countries

- Vibrant teammates and environment

Cons: Manager expects my time and comittment after office hours. Demands the use of Whatsapp on top of emails. Not sensitive and very disruptive to my family and personal life.
Advice: I'm leaving soon, for only one reason - my direct manager.
Pros: Prestigious brand, many free products. Good atmosphere, wonderful colleagues. Company hires good people.

Cons: Management is hierarchical and old fashioned - a lot of people nearing retirement hold the top jobs and they never, ever leave!  

If you have experience outside L'Oreal forget about it as no one cares.   They will want you to adapt to their way of doing things.
Advice: Listen to teams, manage down and stop sucking up to your boss.  Get rid of Managers who have been promoted to their level of incompetence and give younger managers a chance to do things differently or the company will stagnate and eventually fail.  Accept people who come from outside!
Pros: L'Oreal challenges you and ensures you give your best everyday and as a result you learn quickly to be extremely productive! If you can do it well at L'Oreal you will probably succeed anywhere!

Cons: The grad scheme can seem a little aimless when compared to the internship. This is due to the grad scheme being project based and the internship being operational. So the quality of the scheme depends on the quality of the project given. As is life.
Advice: Perhaps allow graduates to be operational for a while before taking on projects as it can be difficult to take on a project when you do not yet understand the operation.
Pros: There is a great work life balance. The employee demographic is young and energetic. The office is in a great location. The pay is good. Everyone is very friendly.

Cons: Poor HR mamagement, GM sucks, Management team in one of a Luxe brand is gullible, take side, no ethic, no matter you are a potential person but if they don't like you, you will never be appreciated. Gossiping, making rumors, don't act luxury as the brand represents.
Advice: Treat employees fairly. Be a leadership not a boss. Be professional. Protect employees. Learn more ethic.  Somebody in retail management level is unqualified and doesn't know how to manage a team, act like uneducated one.
Pros: Benefit, bonus fixed, profit sharing, public holidays,  fund, location, compensation & benefit could be better but that is alright.

Cons: Long working hour and hard to balance work and life

Poor supporting departments ( ex. IT ) 

People are very aggressive in certain divisions
Advice: Give more power to young managers

Be open to employees from non-French speaking countries. It's very obvious that employees who don't speak French has less chance to get promoted

Learn English. It's funny to see a French senior manager cannot give an English presentation.
Pros: Opportunities to work in different subsidiaries and headquarters

Well known brand names

Reasonable salary 

Nice to have on the resume

Cons: - Barely anyone finished at 5pm -- Sometimes you notice, sometimes you don't. But it evens out when you get to leave early on Fridays, so there's no complaining there. If you love your team, staying later isn't as bad as people make it seem.
Advice: None
Pros: - Great starting salary 

- Fun and open environment

- If you have passion for the industry, you will be amazed at what goes on behind the scenes

- Option to work from home during the year 

- Finish at 3pm on Fridays in the fall/winter and 12:30pm on Fridays in the summer 

- Great benefits

Cons: People left leaders not organisation! The top management were unethical and disrespectful. Business is more important so it's OK for leaders to behave unethically  .. a lot of lip service on their people mission and vision, a lot of "writing on the wall" but the truth is ????!!!!
Advice: Walk the Talk! Unethical behaviour leaders should not be in the organisation.  top leaders must show best example, Respectful and act in ethical manner with high integrity, don't undermine the locals
Pros: Dynamic, Great Products, Love the speed and empowerment

Cons: Dictatorship-like management; use-and-abuse employee relationship, including underpayment for hours and effort; the lack of international scope in local offices; promises of nurturing individual talent were silenced and virtually buried once role begins; micro-management by senior management of even the smallest matters; disrespectful attitude of senior management towards subordinates.
Advice: Objectively gauge middle and lower-management's sentiment towards senior management at local offices, respect and develop the idiosyncratic skills of each employee rather than make them fit into the mold of the role.
Pros: Gain understanding of a successful FMCG, large French company with a good reputation worldwide.

Cons: Internal political games and power fights, old habits, agility to change, inexistent project management, poor management competencies, listenning and transparency,  The hierarchy opinion only prevails.
Advice: Be more brave and don't be fooled! More transparency, 360° and honest feedbacks to keep the talented one. Take really into account the feedbacks and inputs from the teams. Put in place a real participative way of managing people.
Pros: Autonomy, freedom to design our job and develop innovative projects, stimulating exposure, real and strong company culture, wonderfull products to work on, many opportunities to grow.

Cons: Not all managers are yet aligned with the new way of leading teams

Obtaining bonuses depends on many criteria and the negotiation is not evident
Advice: Make sure that the group's values and action plans are understood and embodied before being shared by the managers, because not all of them are, unfortunately
Pros: Human enterprise permitting personal and professional expansion

The surpassing of oneself and one's job is encouraged and can lead to many projects

Overall, we can envisage a career in this group from the point of view of job, remuneration, social benefits but also in personal/professional training. 

The links between people are very strong

Cons: The company on the decline financially
Advice: The company cannot go far while making losses. Management needs to make the right decisions especially when it comes to sales and marketing, launches as well as fighting for market share. It also needs some consistency at the helm. 2 years for an MD is very little time. You need a strong local MD who can manage the interference from zone and Paris so that to create time and space for delivering results. Failure to this the company might shut its doors.
Pros: Exposure especially for young employees.

Cons: Very lean structure, I did not have a life while I was there. I was so busy I didn't have time to take advantage of their training opportunities or leave benefits. Went to work while sky was dark and came home when sky was dark. Didn't have a supportive manager as well, I was the third person to leave the company after a year in the same role.
Advice: None
Pros: I was at the Singapore branch, excellent benefits, training opportunities, generally good productive people to work with, opportunities to showcase your work and shine

Cons: Chaotic, no structure, lack of organization, very ineffective, spending hours and days on searching for the smallest information, no processes, not very creative, hierarchical, no recognition or reward for your work, misleading promises for growth opportunities, bad pay, cannot open windows in office, AC system repeatately makes everyone sick, lots of drama
Advice: Appreciation and recognition for the work, stop the misleading career promises!, find a solution for intern housing in Geneva, stop cultivating the chaos in the organization!
Pros: Great name, free products, nice office, some nice collegues, participation to some events, not too stiff, open-minded people, multinational employees

Cons: After the first 3 yrs. the learning curve flattens and politics takes over. High turnover of employees. Above middle management everything is about politics. Promotion and rewards are not based on performance or facts but rather politics.
Advice: Move the company towards a more performance based rewards enviroment.
Pros: Fast pace environment, work & social becomes one, competition between brands and teams is high (which is both good and bad), you get full responsibility (and accountability) from day 1. One of the best marketing schools in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods.

Cons: If you dont want to work hard and surpass yourself,  its better to choose another company. Some managers would need to update their management skills.
Advice: Listen more to younger generation and encourage collaboration and collective spirit
Pros: You can have a carreer you would never have imagined for yourself, just because HR People care about Who you really are,  and challenge you about your project even your dream. And you will meet really different people, all very smart,  différent,  unique,  and with strong personnalities

Cons: Quick promotion due to high turnover 

High turnover can lead to very Junior teams and lack of experience 

A lot of time spent retraining and trying to prevent history repeating rather than progressing as a unit 

Pay grades are secretive
Advice: Be aligned in objectives and filter down to teams 

Share career paths with teams 

Ensure all teams have the same opportunity, and indeed take this opportunity, to have outings 

Train managers in giving appropriate feedback 

Give equal training
Pros: Vibrant, enthusiastic, young team 

Quick promotion if you succeed and overdeliver

Annual conference abroad if good performance 

Discounted products 

Annual profit share for FTEs

Cons: Very disorganized and immature people. The entire culture of the company is based on backstabbing others, and all the departments being pitted against each other. 



Expect to work long hours to get the job done because budgets keep getting cut and departments are understaffed, and also because management is constantly changing their mind about everything.
Advice: Get organized! You should be supporting your employees rather than throwing them under the bus to make yourselves look good.
Pros: Nice offices, summer hours, decent pay, great benefits, and discount on products. The cafeteria has decent food too, and there is a daycare on site.

Cons: Very chaotic company. 

No business etiquette at all:

-No meeting is started or finished at planned time. 

-Not even all meetings are scheduled prior to the time of meeting it self.

-Nobody read emails at all - you have to use whatsapp (your personal one) or other messengers for business communication, so you can not escape them after working hours.

No work/life balance at all, just work/work balance, which is cool but to some extent only.

All decisions can be changed in a second after they were made up and nobody worries.

No processes and procedures (stable or working, or any at all). Especially in Marketing department.

No documentation about projects is created, When employee left - all information about his/her job is lost totally and you have to start from the sketch again.



Too many agencies and third parties involved in the routine procedures (especially in online marketing) - no inner expertize at all

Digital managers are overloaded extremely  as one person basically has to launch and make up and running whole e-shop by his/her own - which is not productive at all, as this person has no time to analyze what is it he or she is doing.
Advice: Create inner expertise inside of the teams, not in outsource agencies  - traffic management, SMM, CRM in every brand team specifically (1 person for every brand, not 1 person for 1 division).



Hire additional devoted people for digital, as current people have no time to eat or sleep or fulfill all responsibilities they have in a proper way.



Create processes. Document them and force teams to follow the processes.



Implement business etiquette trainings, as people do not know, why to insert agenda in the meeting in outlook, or how to create/use Webex.



And start from higher management, as they did not bother to follow their agendas during visits.
Pros: Competitive Salary, friendly atmosphere at the office, "Start up like" approach. You can take as much responsibilities as you can bear.

Cons: Little preparation for individual contributors becoming managers, what can impact the team during the years while the manager is building their people management skills. Many decisions, not necessarily big decisions, still need the final work from central headquarters in France, what can sometimes undermine efficiency and autonomy.
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, open-mindedness, innovative. In many ways, L'Oréal is what they call an "organic" company, where you build connections and work flows across departments, what makes work more efficient, reflecting your own way of working, to make things happen. Close interaction with different departments and divisions are also a great opportunity to learn.

Cons: You are not guaranteed a graduate role at the end of your internship and the way the talent team judge your performance is beyond flawed. If you don't look or 'fit' the L'Oreal head office brand you won't make it far. They rate your performance based on the big projects you've been involved in but not everyone has the opportunity to be part of those.
Advice: Review the internship / graduate process before you lose talented graduates that have spent a year contributing to the business. The company couldn't survive without interns.
Pros: staff shop

staff sale

a lot of responsibility from the beginning

Cons: Enormous pressure, stressful working environment, long decision making processes, countries are extremely dependent on HQ, employees are not valued
Advice: Value your employees! A lot of knowledge, expertise & ideas get lost due to the heavy fluctuation making the internal processes very slow and create wrongdoings. The company could be so much more profitable with a little more employee satisfaction through personal valuation and by employing managers that have a people-focus and know how to motivate their teams!
Pros: Great responsibility, marketing freedom due to big marketing budget, dynamic & young people, international exposure

Cons: With respect to other global companies, unfortunately there is no work structure at all. You may be responsible for everything or nothing. It is real chaotic environment which may be sometimes very inefficient. Also I should add that no work-life balance, you may receive an e-mail on sunday night and it is totally normal thing for here not an extraordinary campaign period or whatsoever.
Advice: Encourage work-life balance

As i know, according to top management chaotic environment is good for the company' development but it totally blaze high turn over rates and dissat
Pros: Young and dynamic environment is the best side of the Loreal

Cons: Although I never experienced it first hand, it seems that my marketing counterparts were often overworked or unhappy. Sales generally thrived in the fast paced L'Oreal environment.
Advice: None
Pros: L'Oreal was a great training place for new grads.

Having been part of the commercial management trainee program, I was able to learn much about the retail landscape managing my own territory as well as get AC Nielsen training &amp; insights from the KAM's. There was a lot of flexibility being on the road - a role that was less stressful than my marketing/finance counterparts. Benefits were great.

Cons: Too much internal politics &amp; way too many meetings. Your career progression in many cases depends more on your networking and your manager's endorsement than your actual achievements, input and commitment.
Advice: L'Oreal needs younger, more diverse leadership of people from different backgrounds and a stronger commitment to change the hierarchical L'oreal culture -' simplicity ' values, which are really inspiring and progressive have not yet been embraced by all senior stakeholders.
Pros: Smart and inspiring people to work with and learn from, exciting projects to be part of, big focus on innovation and entrepreneurship, flexible working

Cons: - Location a bit average for a multinational like L'Oreal
Advice: None
Pros: It's been a year already and here's what I can say already: 

- On-boarding process very clear and user-friendly, HR team will have everything ready prior joining

- Young culture, everyone is so friendly, made lots of friends

- Dynamic environment, processes are so prompt and simple

- Lots of outings and events, great work-life balance

- Lots of talents! High caliber of recruitment

- Perfect employer for Corporate Social Responsibility and Ethics enthusiasts

- Various sports' activities, especially for football and volleyball players (they traveled to Milano for a tournament between different L'Oreal's countries!!)

Cons: - Stressful, unrealistic timelines.
- Worked long hours with little recognition.
- Don't believe in creating processes, expect existing staff to take on more work as they make people redundant. 
- No work life balance - If you are unwell or have annual leave, management still call you on you on your days off. Expected to work  and still check your emails and reply.
- No proper handover for new staff, expects staff to pick up and run with it. 
- Every decision is controlled by overseas Executive team.
- They get staff to spend useless amouts of time of internal presentation packs, when they should be concentrating on fixing and upgrading their internal processes and systems.
- Management level are in their own bubble and need to see and experience how other companies managing and operating.
- High staff over - except for the Executive team, they promote from within.
- While many companies are still encouraging to work from home*Covid* L'Oréal wants to staff to come back into the office asap. - They say they are flexible but really they want to see staff in the office.
Advice: Most of the Management level are in their own bubble. Some have never worked anywhere else except L'Oréal, so they don't  get to experience how other companies managing and operating.
Need to have a  mix of New management, fresh pair of eyes to bring new ideas and give an outside perspective. Otherwise the company will be in the same cycle, with high continuous staff turnover and Ex staff bad mouthing about the terrible experience they had with L'Oréal. Great brands, but don't have a good reputation in the marketplace.
Listen to your staff if they say they're stressed or overworked take action and make sure you can help them. Don't call or text/interrupt them on their days off, annual & sick days are taken for a reason.
Pros: - Summer hours 2pm finish on a Friday.
- Staff shop perks.
- Free department products. 
- Good colleagues staff are great.
- Great range of global brands under L'Oréal.

Cons: Very competitive between depts, and very heavy workload.  Even recreational activities are done with a mindset to win, win, win.
Advice: There were too many changes to the higher management at 1 time that made the employees totally insecure.  Due to this, there were a lot of rumours & paranoia going around, and hence led to disrespect towards the management.  It will be great to ensure that changes are made transparent to staffs.
Pros: Has great perks like products & sometimes beauty services done by trainees. Fun environment

Cons: Many ad hoc tasks/deadlines, overtime everyday, relatively lower salary than other companies especially when you count all the overtimes (no overtime compensation for most of staff). High turnover of staff, hence lot of new staff which does not improve efficiency.
Advice: Organize better timeline for deadlines, invest in automation and staff, dare to say no to headquarter to improve worklife balance
Pros: Young, fun and international culture, good benefits. If you are mobile, willing to work hard, speak both French and Chinese, your carreer opportunities are very good!

Cons: very political, a lot of chances for management trainees to grow, however, if you were not joined as management trainees, there would be very hard for the company to promote you internally
Advice: be opened mind to people who can preform, not only focusing on growing the management trainees, a lot of staff who joined from external firms who might have amazing experience which would be a pity if they don't have a chance to grow
Pros: There were a lot of opportunities in the company, you can take on roles on different brands, and lead different projects, good trainings and exposure within the company.

Cons: Work/life balance. Nobody leaves at 5 although it is when work suppose to end. A lot of stress from your boss/top management. 

Fast-paced environment with considerable amount of stress but still takes a lot of time to get anything done.
Advice: Work/life balance needs to be improved. Keep your talents in your company by providing more free time for employees to spend with family/friends.
Pros: Pay is pretty good as an intern

Nice co-workers

A lot of side benefits (including annual sales tickets, percentage off on all loreal products for employees, etc. You female friends/girlfriend would suddenly love you more for no reason at all)

Cons: Very operationally driven even as a Manager or in managerial role. Can be political at times and culturally its a dog eat dog world. Long working hours at times and no work life balance. Diversity is not prevalence in the organisation though it is what the company has been promoting.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefit and accessibility to beauty products, events etc. Additionally, free lunch is provided every Tuesday and Thursday of the week. Good for career advancement as the organisation values internal promotion than external hiring.

Cons: Pay is not competitive

Depends on luck - sometimes u get bosses that doesnt explain why we do things but just want things to be done.
Advice: Allow more feedback and speak to all tiers of staff not just middle management. 

Change the way of working. 

There are too many level of hierarchies and different interpretations via the managers and the ones executing doesn't relate if they don't meet the right managers
Pros: Face pace 

Given the Flexibility

Able to feedback and voice out

Opportunities not just given to seniors

A lot of fun

A lot of personal development and learning

Cons: -A lot of communication is in french. It is sometimes difficult to communicate effectively with people in your or other divisions because they don't speak english very well.

-Things are very corporate and therefore sometimes inflexible and slow.
Advice: Keep it up, a great company to work for!
Pros: -Prestige

-Respect

-Opportunity

-Challenge 

-Compensation

-Management and coworkers

It is a well managed, well run company that understands both it's customers and employees. Respects the past and looks ahead. An interesting group of people to connect with from different brands and divisions. So much potential. Doesn't accept second rate or not delivering results.

Cons: - Poor leadership - as promotions are given based on politics and not on leadership capability

- No work / life balance - expect to spend long hours in the office everyday, expect to get your plans dropped because an in prompt meeting was set, expect to ask for forgiveness if you take vacation days

- Very competitive work environment - people would do ANYTHING even ilegal things for a promotion, sharks will be waiting for an opportunity to throw you under the bus

- Salary is not great

- Very Hierarchical culture - you will not be able to make any decision in the business  

- Micro management -decisions even the easiest ones like more gold less yellow in a secondary font for a carton will take a lot of meetings until a decision is made

- Racism - expect to be discriminated based on your origin and race, employees are not treated with respect

- Huge employee turnover - at all management levels (from Brand President to Assistant Managers)

- Promotion and rewards are not based on performance or facts but rather politics.

- A lot of work under pressure - because decisions were pushed to the very last minute, you will have your manager on your neck once the decision is made to finish things off

- Little to no training (formal or informal) - you are expected to figure everything out from day one 

- Lack of IT systems-  you end up managing a really large business on excel spreadsheets
Advice: None
Pros: - Beauty business is great, you get a lot of free product and the Xmas party is glamorous. They brought Sarah Jessica Parker

- Amazing brands to work on

- You will always be busy

- You really learn the business

- Management is very knowledgeable of the business

- Attention to the minimum detail

- Very challenging projects

- Great products

- Great name in the resume

Cons: Compensation doesn't seem the best

Sometimes things get too political instead of purely business oriented decisions

Sometimes good practices implemented get lost as the culture is not very process oriented
Advice: Many good talents sometimes leave the company due to the not so competitive compensation, company has to be profitable but being just a little bit more competitive would help keep most of them
Pros: Potential to grow with smart, consistent, hard work

International cultural experience, even if you don't leaving your country, working with expats gives you a different vision

Some great leaders to learn from

Cons: Safety hazards and concocting issues, very high TURN over rate. Lack of communication or RESPECT from upper management. Maintenance not been done properly. PoE not being given. Favoritism as well as impartiality. And no open door policy,at all.
Advice: Communication, equality. Safety walks all day, housekeeping. Termination with out proper cause. Slip and trip hazards. Over working associates due to high TURN over rate.
Pros: Clean enviroment, limited hours worked discounts on merchandise team envisioned, and motivated, and work as a team demonstrating equality and diversity. They don't just stand around during down time,  they are cleaning or helping out others.

Cons: The company which is said to uphold  integrity, respect and ethics. I think it only happen to the higher management to do what they feel and they want. There’s no fairness in ethics, they just cover for the management in any case, no justices. Seriously, feel so sad for the company. Whoever that managed to stay or leave have the same sentiment. 

Never heard of such bad reviews from everyone, people in the company don’t even dare to voice out. They’re worried about the consequences the company or superior will act on.
Advice: Hope the TOP management seriously look into such management style. Nobody will work and stay Long in a company that do not have a equality, ethics and humanities company.
Pros: Big mnc company, dream place for people to work.

Cons: - Overworked and poor work/life balance. High attrition rate. Even before the pandemic, you can feel that everyone just wants to survive the week. Sadly, you will even have to worry about urgent issues or problems to fix on weekends. The pandemic made it worse but the high-stress environment has always been there. You will most likely see employees ranting out on Instagram/Facebook that they just want the week to be over. But it’s a cycle and it seems to never end.

- Long working hours. Pre-pandemic you will see employees working in the office until evening. You will feel ashamed of leaving early because your colleagues are still in the office even after dinner time. You will realize that the compensation and benefits such as 'Freedom Friday' are just to compensate for your overtime every day.

- No investment in modern tools/apps and process efficiency. It seems people are stuck with Excel to do most of their work. This is a problem because employees spend a lot of time and energy on manual processes and execution, and no one wants to initiate change because everyone is just too tired already just to finish their tasks. 

- Managers are all smart and great individual contributors, but I think too young or still need maturity in managing direct reports. Those are different yet equally important skill sets.

- The ‘too much friendly’ culture can be a problem in the workplace also. Because everyone is your friend, everything becomes urgent and people work by asking for favors and considerations all the time. Sadly it becomes toxic because it seems your life will revolve around L’Oreal and you will not have a personal space/time outside L’Oreal. Not to mention the gossipy culture evident in L'Oreal PH.
Advice: Please accept that people are overworked and there is poor work/life balance. Be an example of changing this culture by setting realistic deadlines and a manageable workload. Keep up with the modern times on improving efficiency and how we work.
Pros: - Compensation and benefits, generous allowances on top of monthly salary

- Free products at company events and employee discounts

- People are all nice and willing to help each other get through the week

- Sustainability efforts on all of its brands

- Once a month half day off

- Great established global brand, sadly not so much as a workplace when you are already inside the company. They say L'Oreal works like a start-up, but it operates on a bigger scale being an established brand, which makes it chaotic.

- Growth and fast career advancement, but only if you are willing to sell your soul to the company

Cons: They create positions for people who are already high up just for the sake of it and the title without them actually being a true asset to deserve that position in the company
Advice: Promote people who actually deserve it and instead of asking more from your Beauty Assistants and Makeup Artists ,  ask the regionals and national makeup artists to put more effort towards taking the business further.
Pros: •Some good benefits ( staffshop , commission , hamper bags) 

•My team in the stores I’ve been has always been great.

Cons: Be prepared to work 12-15 hour days. Know that you will be penalized for starting or having a family as you will not advance. If you don't "play the L'Oreal game" you will be forced out and professional integrity will be slandered throughout all levels of the company. You can never trust HR, they will always side with upper management (your voice will never be heard & you will be penalized for voicing your concerns). Turn over is very high and if your not in Marketing, there is no career path or support for advancement.
Advice: 
Pros: Looks good on a resume as most companies will know how much loyalty, determination and personal/professional strength it takes to stay with a company such as L'Oreal. Benefits are great but at what sacrifice?

Cons: Very few processes, bad work life balance, unrealistic demands from senior management
Advice: We say we are consumer centric but much of what we do currently is not. People are too focused on their own career progression by delivering one or two great projects and not focused enough on doing a good job overall. People are often promoted too quickly and so there is often a skills gap at senior management level.
Pros: Very few processes, very talented people, agile working scheme

Cons: - Only the strong survive. It's either you're there for less than 2 years, or more than 5 years.

- Everyone is out for themselves.

- Very French mentality and culture
Advice: Ask your employees what they need to have a more enjoyable work environment, and actually do things to make it happen.
Pros: - They give you the opportunity to run a multi million dollar brand at a very young age.

- You are exposed to the day-to-day struggles of running your own business

- They put you in a position to be able to leave and have the fundamentals to start your own company.

Cons: The culture is so trong you realize that is highly unhealthy and toxic for young people to grow as young professionnals. They will teach you the L'Oreal way, which will make you a very good profesionnals. But you will also have a compltemy biais vision of what it takes to be good. It is not made for everybody. When you realize that sometimes is too late.
Advice: People are not assets you can play with.
Pros: Strong culture, feels like you "belong somewhere" when you are young. 

Possibilities are endlress (if you are ready to pay the price for it...)

Cons: Probably need to be French to make it higher.

Few women in top posts.

The style of management is very 'authoritarian' and control-oriented.

Goals and objectives are infrequently written and rarely clear-- making year end interviews a systematic surprise.

Work efficiency is hampered by bad time management and poor IT.
Advice: The diversity of senior management is a real issue.  This needs to be considered for the long term health of the company.
Pros: In general, the opportunities at L'Oreal are there for the taking, but (a) you need to have very thick skin along the way, and (b) ready to work the long hours.  

There is a good amount of freedom to try new things for such a large company.

The internal training programme is robust.

Cons: Too large and sometimes a little too corporate.  Some brands need to be refreshed but management is still used to how the brand is and not as open to change.
Advice: Be open to different ideas, even if may be not the usual expectations from the brand.  Could also work on improving the work/life balance of employees there and empasizing more collaboration within departments.
Pros: A great place to learn about marketing in the beauty industry and the name will open a lot of doors in the future.  Projects are fun and exciting.

Cons: the same operations, no creativity and development, no leadership culture, values only on the paper, not structured documents, no transition, luck of synergy between department - each department work for own goal, not for common company goal
Advice: - culture - leaders should inspire, develop and coach people 

- HR should care about retention rate - a lot of quality people leave 

- more synergies between departments

- more structured and optimized processes and documents
Pros: Wide scale of operations, intensive work every day, adequate managers, fast growth and opportunities, good office, managers give responsibility

Cons: Some managers are great from a technical point of view, but lack a lot of people management skills. 

Since it's a very popular company, some managers have a philosophy towards their employees of "if you're not happy, 300 people want your job".
Advice: Please keep an eye on the mid-level managers and make sure they are taking care of their employees.
Pros: Good company to learn a lot, let's you lead projects and suggests new ways of doing thing. 

Innovation is valued and recognized.

Younger age average makes it a dynamic work environment. 

Good trainings and career development up to mid-level manager.

Cons: Several operational work, which occupates a considerable part of your working time. Consequently, it rests a few time in order to invest your effort in activities that are ablw to generate a bigger impact.
Advice: Looking directly to the intern job, I believe that the sector's manager could look with more careful to the intern job, providing bigger chalenges so that they can also contribute to the development of this intern.
Pros: Considerable gain of technical knowledge  about  different kinds of packaging and, besides that, an globlal understanding  of the whole chain of a new  launch.

Cons: You will not be able to leave and go Back to normal GT, if you are working in PPD devision of Loreal. (Keep that in Mind)

HR is just for names sake.

Every thing is under control of 3-4 senior level people, some times does not feel that its a MNC.

System and Process and not good and not even at Par with Locoal Organisations level.
Advice: Interdivisional Transfers should be done every 3 years.

Data should come to teams, as its usually flowing the wrong way always.

Authenticity of data is also a big concern.
Pros: Good Policies

Foreign Trips

On time salary

Good Growth Opportunity

Cons: -  Low salary and bonuses compared to other companies in the industry.

-  Work/life balance is almost non-existent.

-  Unless you have a degree, there is pretty much no way to advance (even if you're one of the very best employees).  Basically no career path.

-  Tiny or non-existent raises.

-  Attitude is that we should be grateful to have a job (to explain a $0 raise), grateful to work for the #1 brand and that there are tons of candidates chomping at the bit for our jobs.
Advice: Pay attention to the great talent that you already have and work on developing them for higher positions.  Offer some type of career path so that you can retain the employees who have worked so hard to develop the brand that they take so much pride in.



Offer attractive pay that exceeds what our competitors are paying (if we're #1, don't we have enough money to pay well?????).   As someone currently looking at other companies, I know that competitors are paying up to $25k more annually for similar positions.  I also know that one of the other L'Oreal PPD brands pays that much more for a lateral job.  That is a bit demoralizing.  Also, offer a bonus structure that is directly related to performance so we can feel appreciated for a job well done.



Overall, I LOVE what I do and feel a great affinity for the company.  It would be perfect if it wasn't for the poor compensation.
Pros: -  Great opportunities for personal and professional development (best thing I ever did).

-  Prestige of working for the #1 pro product company in the industry.

-  Looks great on a resume.

-  Wonderful and talented employees that provide a richness of creativity and ideas.

-  Great emotional attachment to the brand.

Cons: Lack of management skills, lack of good structure and good standardized processes, very poor compensation package compared to competitors,  poor introduction to company and training, work/life balance is for some non-existing
Advice: Spend more time developing the employees, search for candidates internally, have more structure in in the way you do business, develop managers through training and courses
Pros: Great name, great brands, good products, trusted with a lot of responsibility from the start, people are proud to work for L'Oréal, International feel, great collegues

Cons: Poor HR policies. Growth is fully dependent on your immediate Boss. Worst part is, if s/he isn't happy with you for whatever reason, you can't survive in the company. The company feels, boss is always right.
Advice: Strengthen HR. Current Training module isn't of much use. Training should be need basis. Also, change from one department to another department (eg sales to Marketing) is an improvement Area.
Pros: Good company to work with. Good products and good in Marketing those products.

Cons: Not a place for staying in comfort zone or people without entrepreneur spirit

Needs more structure and be more focused on "fewer &better"

There are lots of work-life balance for many people, yet some  lacks it
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of space to take initiatives, gives you freedom to implement your own ideas, Great place if you have potential to grow and you'll have opportunities to stretch yourself - regardless of your age

Dynamic, fast, smart in sensing and acting with entrepreneurship

Focuses so much on sense of purpose and the business itself is about "beauty"

Nice people

Cons: To corporate / hierarchical and to structured. Entrepreneurship is not stimulated enough. Most people are really young within L'Oreal. Company needs more diversity: more older people / more man / more people from a different education background.
Advice: Need more diversity in teams. L'Oreal recruits way to many interns to many  or people from student associations. Recommendation is to look more outside the company.
Pros: L'Oreal invest a lot in people. Especially in education. Also the option to develop yourself in the company or to switch a job internally is definitely an advantage.

Working hours are perfect within L'Oreal.

Cons: The politics. a lot of big egos (and a lot of denying there are big egos).  A lot of talk about career progression when actually and staying in a role for 2 years when actually this is only a rule for some when they need it.  It came across that meaningful progression really was only available to those who were part of the management scheme
Advice: None
Pros: The people there are fantastic, everyone is very passionate about what they're doing and really focused and driven on getting things done

Cons: Career development can be improved. Mostly left to the manager so it really depends on who you get.
Advice: Make sure that employees have an ongoing and transparent discussion about their career progression with their manager and HR. Implement 360 evaluation (evaluation by manager, employees and collaborators)
Pros: Working at l'Oréal is a bit like working at a global startup. Their commitment for enabling entrepreneurship is real. And it's a bit like being at a university, tons of young and motivated people. Inspiring vibe and constant exposure to new ideas

Cons: While state management is really friendly and easy to approach, I found there was often a huge lack of communication and a lot of disorganization. Some of the managers had almost too much of a laid back attitude and there was sometimes a blurr between social &amp; business relationships. The counters can sometimes go for months without resources such as testers/samples with no explanation and it can be frowned upon for you to follow up yourself. If you have a permanent position higher management will generally look out for you a bit more but I found that casuals were often forgotten about/left in the dark about their hours/shifts. There were many times where there were problems with the roster and a few issues with payroll which could be very frustrating. The 'OneLuxe' approach is great in theory and did create a lot of support between the different teams within stores; however, it's way too much work for the state managers to handle on their own and  I think that's where the discrepancies in organisation and lack of communication came from.
Advice: State management shouldn't have to look after more than 2 brands otherwise it gets to be way too much for them and the employees and counters suffer because of it.
Pros: L'Oreal offers an excellent social aspect and a lot of quality training and experience in sales. The job perks are wonderful with free products and the management team is really friendly and easy to approach. If you are working here while studying its an excellent job, however, if you do want to pursue a career in beauty or management there are a lot of opportunities and room for progression. They also work hard to recognise staff achievements and the in-store events can be really fun when they are successful.

Cons: 1. Career Development Plan is not set for many, poor milestones which makes you lost , depends more on the opportunities raised (reactive) rather than creating ones (proactive).

2. Salary package is poor, the curve is decreasing make it less competitive to others.
Advice: Work more on the career development for employees and the salary package and benefits after benchmarking with others.
Pros: 1. Career Development in a very flexible environment. Company promotes change of positions despite background. which increases the learning curve.

2. Clear vision and strategy on the corporate level which helps to make things clear and promotes alignment.

3. Learning.

Cons: - poor balance between professional and personal life

- below-average salaries

- high turnover of staff

- no compensation for extra hours

- lack of respect toward young professionals by the company (indicating there's always a line of candidates willing to do your job at the threshold of the company)
Advice: - More timely communication to employees to improve efficiency.
Pros: - real responsibility from day 1

- interesting field of work, diverse social events with colleagues and customers

- very educational for recent graduates

- appreciated by future employers

- profit sharing system

Cons: They lack work/ life balance. Poor management in some departments with lack of insight into business knowledge, lack of direction and accountability.  Fast turnaround in some departments and Sr Mgmt lacks ability to retain talented employees.
Advice: Sr Management needs to recognize employee efforts and utilize resources more efficiently.  Create better processes so that projects are not suddenly dropped on employee last minute.  Improve work/life balance.
Pros: learning large corporate culture

employee discounts and free goods on product

employees are friendly and enjoyable to work with

brand new office building

fast pace organization

Cons: Very low retention of Talents coming from external companies. The company is ready to pay the high price to attract them, but sometimes HR don't know how to motivate and keep them.



I felt like there is a gap between the values and the ethic codes written everywhere and the actual behavior of some people in the company - especially HR Directors. 



A lot of processes and waste of time on projects and basically pretty much everything. Some people work more to serve their strive for power and fulfill their work ambition rather to actually serve the interest of the brands or the company itself. 



Being polite is all about being considerate and appreciative, but for many people, it remains a challenge.
Advice: I very highly encourage top management to be more empathetic and act with more generosity when dealing with people. Sometimes it's only a matter of basic rules of life about politeness.



I also encourage the top managment to place all their employees - from the sales associate from the stores to the head office directors, at the heart of their company values. Even though the HR are claiming out loud equality and so on, in reality we are still far from it. 



And please do not judge others, don't be the first to throw the stone, even if you have higher education it doesn't mean you can't learn from someone with less education.
Pros: Great salary and benefits, working with intellectually stimulating and international people. Everything is done to make you believe you are part of the Elite when you work at l'Oréal.



Amazing projects to work on and real budget behind it to realize it, a lot of new products launched all the time. 



Great Learning & Development policy and programs to keep developing the employees. Also some conferences on diverse subjects to really keep you thinking out-of-the box.

Cons: A lot of old school marketing people. New ideas in marketing are rare and success of the company is insecure, as not whole management is developing. Too much depending on France and brand thinking.
Advice: Accept change and not live it as phrases. Understand what brand building will be in the future and push for new ideas.
Pros: Entreuprenial thinking, responsibility and Great Marketing. You have the chance to decide and execute own ideas pretty quickly, even if you are new. If you can convince management and they buy in. Great brands and good growth!

Cons: Lots of admin work for finance manager level, too many financial forecasts with tight deadlines throughout the year, lots of overtime, compliance is sometimes too loose, in general chaotic working experience between functions
Advice: Need to dramatically improve work-life balance, internal employee equity needs to be standardized to ensure balanced salary ranges
Pros: Not a lot of red tape, new idea and innovation proposals are taken seriously, power of decision-making, amazing learning infrastructure, full of fun and young talent, opportunity for overseas development, hard work is fairly recognized through bonus and salary increase

Cons: Long hours, Traditional Office Politics
Advice: As the company has grown over the past decade, the "red tape" is without a doubt getting thicker and thicker. I would suggest taking a look at efficiencies of current processes and mechanisms and how productivity could be increased with reduced "red tape."
Pros: L'oreal gives you more responsibility than most companies do--usually experience that at most companies you would not get until at a director or VP level--If you can do well in your role you get promoted very quickly

Cons: - no respect for employees

- not transparant at all

- political influenced

- atmosphere is not positive at all.. as if people were masks all the time

- no structure and ineffective work methods

- degrees seem to be mor important then talent or drive
Advice: Degrees are not the main issue to hire / promote people. It is in fact one of the few companies were I saw super motivated people when they entered the company but disgust after a year
Pros: - cool products

- excellence in visual communication

- goodlooking people

Cons: I sometimes feel that they lack manpower as they have limited working space and thus, only able to accommodate the few. Yet, it's still a great place to work and learn from experienced people.
Advice: Don't exactly have any advise as I find the leadership and working condition pretty good. Except maybe, increase in manpower.
Pros: You will be able to meet people from diverse cultures and background. For girls, this may just be the dream land as it has everything to do with being beautiful and presentable.

Cons: Very flshy, takes things on face value, highly perception driven, takes decision based on "Who" aspect rather than "what", top management in India not very capable,
Advice: Takes some good people in Country top management from outside. Devise mechanism to identify talent instead of going by perception, takes decision based on merit of the case and not by who has done it
Pros: Very open and vibrant culture, truly democratic in decisionmaking, not much office politics, senior management very respectful to juniors, efficient middle management

Cons: A sink or swim environment, not much training on the products, long hours, not having the right or old tools in place.
Advice: Need to watch who you hire in a National role as they didn't have enough experience dealing with current staff, felt like I was bullied (in this team) and this person is very passive aggressive. Never gave any coaching or training. This person should not be there!
Pros: The L'Oreal brand has great product allowance, amazing incentives plus a great sales commissions.
Have friends for life as we had a great field team.

Cons: You need to work hard in order to proceed and move further in the organization and understand that a job at L'Oréal might not be always a 9-5 job. But the efforts you invest are worth it in the end!
Advice: None
Pros: I would recommend L'Oréal to any of my friends who are not afraid of challenges and want to work with incredible passionate people! L'Oréal is a great school to learn from the best in the industry while developing yourself further each and every day. There is an individual training plan created for you each year!

Cons: Bad Management, brand leaders always makes you down by keeping their low ideas. Thinking about a day you're senior staff but your new brand leader tell you that "it's my brand my money, don't say no to me". 
No traning no oversea meeting, no development plan over the past 2 years.
Advice: Please check your brand leaders again, they are the reason that we - senior staffs leave company
Pros: Inspiring luxury brands to work for. You can learn brand story and adapt to your lifestyle. Flexible working time

Cons: - Conflict is a very normal way of communicating in this company. Not always very efficient nor constructive. 
- Ensure that employees are mature before you promote them to avoid creating a playground at management level
Advice: Show that respect and constructive feedback are the basis of every healthy functioning company
Pros: You'll get the opportunity to learn from the best and experience a company culture that aims at pushing you out of your comfort zone. It's a fast faced environment and it's not for everyone, but the empowerment they give to employees is unrivaled.

Cons: L'Oréal is great if you have no children and are starting your career and are ready to put a lot of hours in. It works great at the beginning of a career because of the involvement required. Once you advance in experience, you might want to move and get something less challenging to have more of a balanced life.
Advice: None
Pros: You work like an entrepreneur and manage your own work. Fast pace environment and energetic co-workers from all horizons. Standards are high in the output and it brings the best out of you.

Cons: it's sweatshop - you will be doing the job of 4-5 people at the same position in the Western European subsidiary, HUGE turnover (abou 20%\)
Advice: there should be the same approach towards employees across the company in the different countries - the offices comfort is not the same, the workload is not the same, very few locals (not to say "no at all" in the management comittee), no credible intelligent HR directors.
Pros: it's international company and have such employer in the 3d world country is greatest advantage

Cons: If you want to be successful, you will work hard. The hours aren't crazy but don't expect to get everything done in 9-5.

Lack of process/structure is challenging at times, you have to know lots of people to get things done and often have to ask forgiveness rather than permission. This could also sit in the PROs too!
Advice: More interconnectivity between countries would be really smart. Particularly for corporate functions.
Pros: Lot's of responsibility and autonomy, freedom to be entrepreneurial.



Flexible working for all staff in the UK is amazing.

Cons: Not as many as the pros, but it can feel a bit bureaucratic, a lot of documentation. The workload can be overwhelming sometimes and there is a lot of pressure from all the stakeholders. Unfortunately the salaries are not great either.
Advice: Try harder to retain the good people!
Pros: Working at L'Oreal will find you in a great environment, very diverse with numerous nationalities. There are opportunities to move in the company and generally a lot of trainings and tools to develop. It feels like you are heard as an employee and your opinion matters.

Cons: Lack of opportunities to a permanent position in despatch leaving a great number of agency workers who've been working there for years in a situation of precarity with no benefits or career development prospects,

Some managers and supervisors can be quite arrogant, 

Constant performance expectations and reviews with a somewhat innacurate percentage based system resulting in a general sentiment of discontent and lack of morale.
Advice: Creating more opportunities for agency workers to a permanent position.
Pros: Good amount of hours (37.5 weekly),

Decent training provided,

Overall safe and tidy facilities,

Ongoing somewhat secure work.

Cons: The work ethos can be overwhelming, they're notorious for working incredibly hard but this can sometimes lead to staying in the office until 8pm, merely because the rest of your team is.
Advice: Set a better example of healthy working ours, everyone should work at their own pace and on their own terms - sometimes this can get lost due to teams working incredibly long hours, which then gets filtered down as something that's expected of you.
Pros: They really take care of their employees and your mental wellbeing within the company.

Cons: - swim or sink attitute - you have to find your way and do it quickly

- your career really depends on who you know - strong networking skills are a must

- "We are looking after our staff" is not their motto
Advice: Please value your people more
Pros: - people are L'Oreal's everything: talented, charismatic, bubbly and creative

- it is fun to work and fun to party

- enterpreneurial spirit is very strong

- fantastic products to work with

- realtively easy to explore international career opportunities

Cons: I felt it was unsupportive working environment. I would describe it as dog eat dog type of place.

Work / Life balance was not something I did enjoy and as a result I was feeling depressed and lethargic. I felt that the processes and systems were unnecessarily cumbersome and manual.

I felt like a cog in a wheel, totally expandable - replaceable in a heartbeat. Pay-wise its not a very generous employer, given the expectations of staff.

For me personally it was not a time well spent working there and I will look back at this company as the bad mistake I have made in selecting a workplace.
Advice: Look after your staff
Pros: I honestly could did not see any pros working there

Cons: Old school management (incl. top management).

Toxic atmosphere (high pressure, big turnover of the teams, can't trust HR and managers).

Most of managers are there since years and are being promoted not for their competencies but thanks to politics games. All good elements resign after a few weeks/months.

The company in Australia is getting bad results year after year (i.e. the global sharing is at its minimum since couple of years). However, the staff/management responsible for this poor performance is still being promoted to the top position.
Advice: Bring more Ethics and get rid of the useless managers.
Pros: International company.

Nice location.

If you're good in networking, then you can be promoted very quickly (no matter if you perform well or not in your job).

Staff shop.

Cons: The culture can be somewhat chaotic and unstructured which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but takes time to get used to and learn what's going on (not really any sufficient training materials). The pay is also not great for interns (especially given the cost of living in London!).
Advice: None
Pros: Working at L'Oreal can be really enjoyable. The people are generally really outgoing and fun. You can get exposure to life at a top firm with a diverse range of products and processes. The staff shop is also a real bonus!

Cons: Perks did not outweigh the cons: lack of ability to progress into different areas, no encouragement or support from senior members of staff. They seem to only retain employees who are either cut-throat or want to stay in the same position. No reward or attention to those who are improving product sales, work hard and/or show great passion for the brand/company. Office politics makes for a tricky working environment.
Advice: I'm afraid there isn't much point....
Pros: Gained a lot of insider beauty industry experience.

Cons: Whole system is in one big chaos, it doesn’t matter where you work. The base is just chaos. Also totally disrespect of people needs, with really low wages cokparing to the other companies. Not valuing people (menthors) whom, after a while, leave company and use Loreal as a jumping board toward next position
Advice: None
Pros: Good thing is the brands you are working on. Also, possibility to progress in career (depending on how good you can do politics with right people. Also, in every company there is politics, but here is just much more.

Cons: The work/life balance has always been (and continues to be) an issue - unrealistic expectations in terms of deliverables, and endless rework and revalidation mean that things take far longer than they should. It is also a very political environment, with a lot of paranoia amongst managers - especially at a senior level.
Advice: None
Pros: The company has some great brands and there is a lot of energy in the place. The company is also very good at fitting your career path to your individual interests and strengths,

Cons: -hands-off training style, very sink-or-swim attitude 

-poor communication all-around; you spend more time in meetings getting people on the same page than accomplishing actual work/making decisions

-company culture can be rather off-putting
Advice: -improve coordination/communication between various departments

-encourage more innovative/out-of-the-box styles of leadership/idea generation
Pros: -lots of opportunity for upward movement, as well as movement across different divisions and brands

-solid benefits package and perks (early release on Fridays in the summer, $75 free goods bi-monthly, etc)

Cons: Be prepared for long (uncompensated) working days, ad ho deadlines, shfting priorities, conflicting instructions from managers and an elbow culture. There´s not much teamspirit, everyone is just focused on their own job and career.
Advice: Care more about the employees. Give them propoer training and hire more staff so employees do not continuously work overhours to tackel the workload.
Pros: If you want a creative and challenging job with lots of responsibilty and fast advancement opportunities, this is the place to work for you.

Cons: Crazy working hours and zero to no work life balance, employee viewed as a mere number and not person, hr very much a siloed function with junior staff not getting a lot of support
Advice: better work life balance needed, mentor system should be set up. more secondment options, junior members need to see a work life balance structure in place so they could see themselves growing with the company
Pros: excellent training, inspirational peers and seniors, marketing excellence, ownership and accountability, good benefits and good location compared with other FMCG businesses, good career progression

Cons: CYA enviroment.

Upper Management often looks out for themselves and doesnt try to develop the majority of talent.



High turnover, long hours and pay is below market equivalents.HR has as large say in career succession and is very disorganized.
Advice: Invest in your people and look out for their best interests.
Pros: you work with great people in a young and dynamic environment. A place where you will make good contacts in different cities should you choose to stay in the FMCG industry when you choose to leave.

Cons: Bad atmosphere in some luxury brands, difficulty to communicate with the hierarchy, extremely vertical organisation. Very stressful environment but it can also be considered as an advantage to learn and go beyond your limits.
Advice: Stop the useless meetings, it is not always welcome to make a "point" on Monday AND wednesday AND Friday whereas you could have solved it way better by yourself.
Pros: Great salary and good training, there is a competition that allows you to give the best of what you can do.

Cons: Poor Management 

Very Less employee incentives
Advice: Candidate considered for managerial position should have leader ship qualities. In loreal, a candidate deems fit for managerial position based on his seniority and experience - regardless of the fact that whether he or she can lead/manage team or not.



Secondly, Employee's are more important than customers/consumers.
Pros: Work Delegation - Managers delegate most of their tasks to their Juniors. Helping them grow faster

Experience - beside learning one's work, new starters or mid level employees are exposed to higher management which helps them become more confident and grow.

Cons: Forever feel as if we are preparing for an international visitor! Australia is not a valued market.
Advice: None
Pros: A business that is forever evolving, no 2 days are the same so if you are resilient, passionate and ready to work hard then L'Oreal is a great place. Success is part of the culture, but more so in recent years the how we win is just as important. L'Oreal places allot of value on it's people and you as an employee feel as if you can make a difference.

Cons: When you go to training they say its a ethical company but when you work in the sales. They want numbers anyhow. If you are working according to systems you wont be promoted but if know bootlicking and can do sales by even wrong means.you will b promoted.
Advice: U r carrying a huge brand name atleast take care of that. Sales doesnt mean you can do it unethically. U r loosing talent and market share because of this only.
Pros: Only pro is that you will have good salary and remineration.

Cons: Unpaid overtime, no work/life balance, politics, low basic salaries, unrealistic sales targets/ no stock availability to hit targets, no stock handlers available in most stores resulting in back problems from carrying stock from the stockroom to the counter, no support from HR
Advice: Would be great to offer education opportunities to the employees to progress within the company. Salary increase should reflect the work of each employee rather than be based on annual inflation.
Pros: Great trainings, promotions in place if you work for it

Cons: Salary is low compared to the workload, and it almost doesn't change every year regardless of how well you perform. Middle management can be smart individuals, but doesn't mean they are able to lead a team.
Advice: Train excessively newly promoted managers on how to be team leaders and influence.
Pros: You are constantly exposed to so many influential people and organizations, you have the responsibility and oppurtinity to prove yourself and own your brand completely. 

A lot of perks like department and company parties, trainings &amp; employee discounts.

Cons: No work life balance

Too many meetings

Senior management keeps changing priorities

Senior leadership are great at beauty but not great leaders

Toxic people are kept even at upper management
Advice: Learn how to make choices and stick with them

Expand requirement for leaders to not just be beauty experts but be great people leaders, and exit toxic leaders

Greatly reduce # of review meetings
Pros: Fast-paced so things are always exciting, at the forefront of innovation

Working on beauty brands is a lot of fun

Very competitive salary &amp; benefits

Cons: -the French influence can create some tendencies towards too much bureaucracy and written policies and requirements, vs. assessing what is value-added to the business

- work culture can be toxic

Cons: Some managers really shouldn't be managers. Unethical, leaking confidential, and often untrue information about employees to their peers. Hypocritical and also 

Managers also seem to be of the habit of making their team do most of the work, yet claiming the credit. They aren't transparent and I get the sense that they deliberately set the employees they don't like up to fail.
Advice: Hire better managers. Keep an eye on turnover within teams and ask yourself "is this something to do with the management?"

Advice: None
Pros: Some nice people , no one really checks what you are doing

Cons: It is sometimes difficult to understand all the expectations due to the belonging of L'Oreal Canada to an international company.
Advice: It could be nice to have a better canteen on the main building.

Annual events such as information meetings just make you feel you are part of a great company.

L'Oreal is very well located in a beautiful location

Compensation and benefits are very good

Cons: Management micro-managing every detail, extremely hierarchical in all way. The CEO seems to be anti-work life balance ( everything has to be done immediately-no priorities , emails sent on weekends and bank holidays).Very short headcount.Lot of focus on placing blame rather than moving and solving issue.
Advice: Treat people with respect and trust them. Hire more people.
Pros: Very talented people, interesting products, the best training you can get, you make your job description as you wish.

Cons: Office politics, no objective employee evaluation, bad office atmosphere, people's aggressiveness
Advice: First reform your HR departments, then enable them to positively impact the rest of the company. Reduce office politics.

Put competent, high skilled managers as team leaders instead of people with just great taste.

Cons: Lack of career opportunities (small subsidiary), work-life balance doesn't happen for some people, depending on position. Compensation is average, could be better. The annual raise for young people is low (2-3%) and the work can be overwhelming at times, so many young talents leave after 1-2 years.

Poor work life balance, the company thinks that you need to devote 100% of your life to work.

Bad managers. Managers are good product creators, but have poor people management skills.
Advice: None
Pros: Mobility across functions, brands and geographies.

The company is truly serious in producing high quality products, very reliable.

Young people, high energy environment.

Cons: Where to start...
Very poor management, I had never seen so unprofessional managers (not fair, not knowledgeable, speaking to staff in extremely rude manners,...)
Very childish environment, people spend their time gossiping 
Highly disorganised, seems like it is in the company DNA
There is no culture of being good at your work and efficient it is all about showing your passion and staying endless hours at your desk and working all the time then you get promoted even if you are bad
Advice: Hire good and fair managers you should finally see the staff turn over going down...
Pros: Good benefits, lots of free products 
Holiday leave

Cons: - Training and development are promised but not encouraged

- Underpaid job, fast promotion but salary increase is laughable (e.g. a few hundreds HK dollars for promotion)

- Long working hours, require you to work in weekends with no OT paid or compensation leave 

- Top management is not respectful

- No strategy to retain talents, very high turnover rate
Advice: Put people first. If you want to hire/retain someone with passion, you should first be passionate about development them. I saw a lot of talent left the company because of the poor management.
Pros: - You can get free goods, but most of them are slow moving products

Cons: The structure and the system of the company is a little bit messy. The regulations are not so clear and performed.
Advice: Please pay more attention to the management trainee program, appreciating the different employee's capability and taking advantage of them. Higher the importance of the rules.
Pros: L'Oreal is a diversified company, creativity  and actively learning are really appreciated here.  Doing work about the cosmetics for the beauty will be really fantastic.

Informal information channels are more powerful than formal ones
Advice: More clarity and structure in the head office, all the change process should be centralized and top down
Pros: You can grow very fast  if you are good in managing multitask space and complex prsonal working situations.

It's a grat school for learning how to navigate in very status-based and complex corporate culture

Advice: Change focus to make it a healthy organization, promote and growth talents.
Pros: good ambiance and workplace. Nice place to explore your self and stretch your expertise.

Cons: not a friendly environment to learn

company would choose to exploit manpower instead of improving technologies so that systems can run smoother

over time is a definite

cost cutting is key and will sometimes hold priority over staff welfare
Advice: invest in better technology

value your staff

money has to be spent on good marketing for it to work
Pros: you get to learn a lot, treated like a loreal staff

you learn how to dress and make up better

hierarchy is quite flat

Cons: Very little room for women in top management

Your voice as an assistant manager isn't really heard

I had an insensitive, inconsiderate boss and the HR did nothing to help me and sided with the boss

My friends at RB, HUL and PnG made more money

Terrible work life balance, but that was partially because I had a bad boss also

Too many meetings
Advice: Don't always side with the upper management in a conflict.
Pros: The work culture in other teams appeared to be healthier

Nice colleagues

Cons: Apart from the discount everything is a con. I worked for YSL beauty owned by the Loreal brand for 2 years..they expect you to work stupid hours be fully flexible to the point the staff rota constantly changed without them even telling you, you get treated and spoke to like a child from upper management when they come to visit, constant turnover in staff, wasn’t given yearly pay rise on top of my appalling salary (No excuse as to why). MY ADVISE DO NOT WORK HERE UNLESS YOU WANT NO LIFE AND TO BE MADE TO FEEL UNAPPRECIATED
Advice: Start looking after staff!
Pros: Discount... that’s about it the rest is negative

Cons: Sometimes excessive pressure and focus on the minor details that don't shift business performance

Fun, passionate people around to motivate

Steep learning curve from the outset 

Innovative thinking environment lends itself to achieving strong results

Cons: - Can be a highly stressful environment

- Remuneration could do with some work

- A lot of red tape to get projects moving smoothly (also, understandable given the nature, size and responsibility of the business)
Advice: Keep making progressive changes that have been seen in recent years. Keep your focus on "the people" and the culture.
Pros: - Opportunity to work on some of the most globally recognised brands

- In recent years, a huge focus on company culture 

- Great perks

Cons: Upper management has too many divas.

Favors in promoting the under 40 age group over others that are qualified but older.

Departments don't talk to each other very well.
Advice: Upper management are unapproachable and subordinates are sometimes frowned upon for no

reason.
Pros: -Lower management knows about life/work balance.

-Good quarterly bonuses.

-Free goods twice a year.

-If you are a recent graduate from college you are golden.

Cons: Worst work life balance. 9 - 5 job? I've never done those hours the whole time I've been there. You will be there until 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or even midnight. And even then you will go home and work more. Those hours are expected. Even if you leave at 6, it will be noticed and asked why you are leaving early. Meetings are regularly scheduled after 'work' hours. Say goodbye to having dinner with friends and family. Say goodbye to your life.  



Worst culture. A boys club. Yes in a beauty company. It's as if as a female you have no opinion, your ideas are wrong, you are looked down on. 



Worst planning. Everything was due yesterday. No concept of prioritising. Everything is now, now, now. There's no planning out beyond the current season. It's reactive, not proactive. 



Worst development. Zero focus on development plans or training. You will be promised it but it will never happen. You won't get any feedback on your performance until the end of year review. And trust me, shocks will hit you in the face at your review. I've seen barely any promotions unless you are well liked, not if the person is ready. 



Worst turnover. Rumoured to be 75%. I think it's higher. It's a never ending revolving door. No stability. No getting to know your team. Constant upheaval. 



Worst hiring of local talent. A lot of talent is brought in from international locations. I wouldn't call them talent really. I regularly see international people here to work in Australia hired over locals and L'Oreal getting these people visas. 



Worst management. No clear direction. No vision. No sharing of objectives and results. No team activities. Any managers that allow all these things to happen are not worth working for.



Worst place to work. Don't do it. You think you will be working for a big company with great brands. You will regret it. Trust me. You will want to walk out constantly. Trust me.
Advice: Test others how you want to be treated. Treat your employees like humans. Offer encouragement and advice. Celebrate wins. Be human.
Pros: Big company that looks good on your resume. Only because it is a well known fact that if you can last a year at L'Oreal you can do anything.

Cons: Political culture - management values a very specific type of people. People tend not to make rational decisions and are instead motivated by emotions, without focusing on driving business.



Very limited training opportunities, everything is learnt 'on the job'
Advice: Attrition issues will never be resolved if you refuse to solve the root of the problem
Pros: Reputable brands, wide scope for young people to learn from

Cons: Everything happens in a very "organic" way... i.e., desorganised. Average age is very low so there is a lot of inexperience, stress and wasted energy.
Advice: Continue the changes so not so much energy is wasted reinventing the wheel without learning from experience
Pros: Very passionate and talented people. Average age is very low so there is lots of energy and passion. Current management is simplifying and making changes to make things more organised.

Cons: Can take some time to adapt since innovative and flexible structure can lend itself to a complex organization
Advice: Networking and entrepreneurship is key.
Pros: The integration programs for new-to-L'Oreal employees are well thought out and relevant.  Although the culture is not always easy to understand, L'Oreal goes out of the way to ensure that there is an integration plan and that new employees get the full disclosure on how to navigate and succeed at L'Oreal.

Cons: Over-rated as a global multi, I've worked for other multi-nationals and L'Oteal attracts and retains a poor talent pool because of the way they treat employees. If you have low self esteem or are a desperate grad, join them. The previous comments of bullying within from management is completely true. The comments re: a "high performance" culture reflects the fact senior people justify their incompetence by pushing those who work in field, on counter, as customer facing or in subservient positions.
Advice: Overpaid ex-pats are a waste/mistake as are overpaid politicians. Australia has a place in the global market so stop treating it with disrespect.
Pros: I will be honest, not kind. Nothing.

Cons: Could have more one to one initial training when first starting with the brand to help individual needs of own learning
Advice: Shouldn’t have to book Saturdays as a holiday- should be able to have Saturdays as a day off from time to time.
Pros: Free allocation, staff discount, perks, training days with extra perks! A reputable and well established brand who look after their staff very well.

Cons: Please, do not be bamboozled and fooled by the company propaganda plastered all over linkedin and career sites of the fake utopia they want you to believe in. Before accepting this internship at the DMI (Direct Marketing International) in Paris I was warned by professors that they dealt with students being exploited and worked like a slave - I should have listened they were right. If you are reading this I highly advise to work for another company in France. I have 10+ years work experience. I took this internship because I am a foreigner and it was apart of my masters to have an internship and complete it to graduate.   This is by far the worse job I have ever had in my 10 years working as an adult. Interns are exploited at this company. I came to France for better work life balance - haha I should have run away as soon as I got this offer. Plan on leaving the office at 7/8pm - and if you work from home, good luck they will abuse you like an animal. I was told as well as other interns to LIE on our time sheets about the amount of hours we worked because apparently they had a scandal a few years ago about over working interns - I AM HERE TO TELL YOU IT’S STILL HAPPENING and even during a pandemic. Everyone knows we work well past our contract hours - now we are just told to lie about it and WORK IN SECRET. Managers will play a psychological game to save their reputation to HR. They will tell you to go home in person with smiles and concern but in reality you know you cannot because they pushed 5 hours of work on you at 5pm so you end up either staying late at the office or taking your laptop home to finish. My contract said 35 hours, I was easily working 60 - 80 hours a week and sometimes finishing work on the weekend. You try and keep up with the endless demands of managers who will have you redo the same powerpoint 27 times (I am not over exaggerating this is how many times I reworked a powerpoint once that was just used for an internal meeting). The company culture is very hierarchical if you have a lower position you will be ignored or talked down to or most likely not even listened to.   I feel the company is getting away with abusing interns because most of the interns are young and do not have any previous work experience. Also no one reports the bad behavior because they are relying on their manager to recommend them in order to get hired. When I tried to speak up and say something to HR I was ignored and brushed aside and told to speak transparently with my manager who was regularly condescending, her constructive criticism on a powerpoint presentation I completed with another intern was “the beginning is pretty and the end is getting shitter and shitter.” Let’s just say she made the Devil Wears Prada look like a nice person.   Working here is only worth your time if you have an upper management position in this company. Working as an intern you are paid 1200 (1400 but 200 is taken out every month for taxes) and as a junior if you do get hired you will be getting paid 2200 per month and barley scraping by in Paris while you give your entire life to a company that doesn’t appreciate you - I wouldn’t recommend it. Also they will try and entice you to stay for 5 years because at the end of 5 years you have access to shares. All of my managers worked for the company for 5+ years and its the only thing they know in their working careers - I honestly pity them because they do not know that life can be so much better.   I wanted to quit this internship and I couldn’t I had to finish it in order to validate my masters - this is how it is done here in France. The company knows this. They know they own you for 6 months and you won’t be able to get out - my recommendation is don’t start -run away while you still can.
Advice: More accountability needs to be place on managers and how they treat interns. I contacted previous interns that also worked underneath the same female manager and they all had the same experience of bullying as me.

  change)

Put in place actual processes to ensure uniform work from all departments.

Leading cosmetics company

Notorious

International

Nothing.

Not much else to say.

Cons: Favouritism is shown left and right, staff is overloaded with work, slay and job competencies mismatch is present here. inefficient IT services.

Pros: Free perfumes colognes cream and good people who are always willing to help. Also the work load was very fair.

Cons: Senior Management make all the decisions and quick to dismiss other viewpoints. 



Yet indecisive management means we need to adapt to constantly changing objectives.



Lots of reliance on interns and grads who have worked their way up and adopted company values but lack best practice experience.



Very inefficient ways of working. Too much time spent in meetings which add little value. Lack business strategy and direction. Lots of unnecessary high level roles cause confusion as unsure who needs to be involved and they are not required to create business strategies. 



Contrasting opinions of senior management with unclear briefs given resulting in many insignificant changes forced on by managers.



Very frustrating to work with slow paced decision makers. Difficult and embarrassing to communicate with cusomers. Constantly wasting time.



There is a lack of people management skills. Some managers lack self awareness and the impact their behaviour causes on others.



I have witnessed and experienced bullying here by Senior Managers who try to make you fit the mould. This issue is not tackled but ignored. This has led to my departure without an exit interview.



Turnover is exceptionally high at at least 70% but there it has become a joke rather than addresses.



Systems are very out of date. Many do not have access to work from home so have to come into the office at weekends.



Lots of wasted money in the wrong areas yet not enough spent to motivate their people. Lots of out of pocket expenses when travelling.
Advice: Review business structure and ensure you have the correct people managers in place which can drive strategies without abusing their power of authority.



Feedback is 2 way and should be engaged across all levels of the business to get the best result first time.



Provide people management training. Tackle bullying head on. Managers are not motivating their teams and fuelling constant churn of employees. How you treat others is a reflection of yourself and the business.

Pros: Pay, dresscode, cafeteria, friday hours, holidays, advantages, social benefits, coffee, discounts, work from home, christmas time off, advancement possibilities, location

Cons: New management tries to change the company. I think that it damages to the firm's popularity. These actions should be rewieved
Advice: I advice to management about getting logical firing decisions. If the operational costs of company is too high it can't be solved by sending people

Cons: Before joining I assumed a highly professional work environment due to the world class products L'Oréal markets, unfortunately I have encountered immature and shallow material girls/ boys on all levels obsessed with the superficialities of life. The workload and inefficiency is insane, people that can't keep up are considered 'weaklings' and not worthy. No business processes and no HR vision. Get ready to be stabbed in the back and lied to: making co-workers look bad is the way to get ahead!
Advice: Interesting reading material: 'The No A*****e Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace'
Pros: Oustanding brands

Discounts on L'Oréal products

Cons: there is a room for improvement the culture of innovation, out of the box. The culture of confrontation could be less confrontation and more collaboration.

Pros: multinational global company, leader globally in some categories as hair coloration, skin care. Global brands with an excellence in quality of products.

Advice: try to become even more international
Pros: very successful and sustainable, entrepreneurial spirit, never boaring, wide portfolio of brands, good  CSR programs, leaves room for individual development

Cons: - Horrifying management: one's leadership is hardly taken into account during promotion, thus creating many junior employees with 0 leadership and manipulative personalities ending up in the management. Language abusive & workplace bullying are sadly too common.

- Politics: sometimes promotion depends solely on what relation you have with the big guy.

- Gossip: everyone speaks ill of everyone behind everyone's back. Way to encourage trust and teamwork!

- Inexistent work-life balance: 60 to 80 working hours per week.
Advice: Provide psychological counselling to the constant cases of mental breakdown.
Pros: - Career opportunities

- Interesting projects

- Decent salary for marketing position

- Big name to put on cv

Cons: Design decisions are highly constrained. Input is limited. Initiative is discouraged. Business people with little to no understanding of programming try to dictate design decisions. Consultants who remain either prove their worth as data analysts or codge together haphazard code to meet some supposedly urgent  and poorly thought out requirement.



Consultants are definitely not "part of the family". They are unable to participate in company-sponsored volunteer programs. Their children cannot participate in the "Bring Your Daughter/Son to Work" day and are not eligible for scholarship programs. On the other hand, they are expected to give the "face-time" and keep the hours of a clock-punching regular employee. Consultants should consider whether parenting responsibilities and traffic to one of L'Oreal's inconvenient locations will cause them to arrive at the office after 9 am, since such "late" arrivals will count against them, regardless of any compensating late hours or weekends working at home. Working away from the office is discouraged and long hours spent on major changes will not be compensated; you will be told to reduce the hours you are claiming for the month.



Their pay on a corp-to-corp would be barely tolerable on a W-2. That rate is never increased, even after years working for L'Oreal as a consultant.  Also, consultants are paid monthly for the previous month's work, usually after the 15th. Payment processing occurs in several steps, each of which is done by a separate individual or group on their appointed day of the week. If that appointed day is a company holiday -- or some other excuse -- then the checks are delayed for another week. Consultants are advised to work through a consultancy primarily serving contracts with companies making more punctual payments than L'Oreal.
Advice: Stop the charade and hire your technical staff at full-time, permanent positions. You may have to spend more for timely payroll, benefits and raises, but you will not be needlessly angering your workers. You will also be giving your technical staff the authority they need in order to properly design your computer systems.



Then you should seriously consider letting programmers work from home, with only an occasional meeting, or group of meetings, to hash over design issues. Without the clock being used as a measure of work, programmers can be free to solve problems in the most efficient manner: awaking themselves in the middle of the night when they finally figured out what was causing that bug and immediately coding the fix.
Pros: Discount at the Company Store

Cons: The downsides of the company was no good facilities of salary.
Advice: None
Pros: The work environment of the company was very good. It is one of  the best fastest growing company. People feel so proud to be part of the company as company provides full support o their employeee in professional front.

Advice: It would be nice to ensure better treatment and development for the employees as they are the best asset of the company
Pros: Learning by doing, improvement projects and processes

Good reputation, known company, hard-working colleagues 

International and dynamic environment

Cons: This company is not for everyone. If you can handle hard pressure from an organized chaos, then thumbs up!
Advice: None
Pros: The best thing to work at L'Oreal is that you have space to initiate, speak out and realize your idea. Also to work on out of scope projects which will enhance your knowledge and abilities to switch to others positions in the future.

Cons: -the new CEO Hieronimus is well known for being extremely tough. It’s a huge step backward for the company as it has strived for years to improve its reputation and external image. 

Career paths are random for the most part: they remain extremely unclear and down to the people you meet and work with. If you end up working on the wrong brand or in the wrong division, you will get stuck and have a slow progression with endless parallel moves that will degrade your curriculum. HR’s do not even hide the fact that each career at L’oreal is highly singular: in other words, it’s down to plain luck. Those that emerge are not the most talented ones but those who were lucky enough to work with influential people who over the years worked their way up the corporate ladder. The so called meritocracy that the company often boasts is a complete lure.

Don’t expect a progressive stance on home office either: at best employees will get 2 days of home office whereas most corporations have taken the leap and now let their employees work 100% from home if they wish.

Increasing positive discrimation too: if you are a mid age white male, you will struggle, however good your records are.

Terrible work life balance if you work in a local business unit or in a DMI.
Advice: Merit-based promotions leveraging 360 evaluations. 

Higher monthly salaries with much less profit sharing: when a company delivers 3,5 months of revenue in profit sharing and about 12% of variable pay you know that something is wrong with your monthly pay slip. 

Real training: E-learning is used massively to keep most employees away from proper personal development trainings. Only a handful of employees still benefit from coaching or leadership training. 

Stop simplicity: everyone knows it’s a decoy.
Pros: Most brands are good, but lots of them are also totally overlooked. Pick the right ones or end up suffering a lot with zero budget and maximum pressure to turn them around like all your predecessors who tried, failed (and left).

Cons: It exists a huge Gap between Managers from L'oreal PT when compared with other FMCG in Portugal. They lack on management and HR skills, very  authoritarian environment with few chances of carreer progress for the below HR levels. No rotation between Internal structure and no outside recruitment for Midlle management.

Consequence: Old Managers using always the same formula of managemen and very demanding and authoritary. Or, very unexperient expatriat that are promoted to Directors levels, managing teams of PM with more experience then them, creating a very bad environment and lack of credibility doing business.

The average stay for new commers in MKTG is 2 years maximum, because of the bad pressure of the managers near levels below, to do things quick with lack of resources, bad salaries and exploiting at maximum, the new trainnes and recent product managers, with hours and hours of administrative/mecanic work, and no strategy or whatsoever.

No respect for the operational colaborators, neither Product managers. The mentality is that PM are priviledge to work there, even in extreme bad conditions of authoritarian environment. No room for autonomy and meritocracy. I dont recomend L'oreal Portugal to work on, at all.
Advice: For Managers: Get a life, besides work, and let other have it too! 

I dont believe the company will ever figure how to be a Great place to work. Learn with the competition, and learn to be open minded, hearing everyone in the company: from the lady that cleans toilets to the recent trainnee just arrived, because everyone deserves 1st respect and the benefict of doubth that it has some inteligence. Thats DIVERSITY, and that's what enriches the companies... diversity blend.
Pros: The proximity with Innovative products only.

Quick way of getting a good idea of how the market works, how the company thinks, and the dinamic of each segment on the cosmetic field.

Very glamorous world, only on the advertising. No such glamour on a daily basis, but very hard work, with no balance in the quality life.

Cons: l'oreal usa tends to work its middle management hard - work/life balance is hard to maintain due to the expectations of middle managers (especially production)
Advice: provide more live feedback regarding individual performance to management - a lot is encouraged for hourly folks; same expectation should be given to management.
Pros: l'oreal usa offers a great opportunity to advvance your career quickly.

Advice: None
Pros: You can find good and bad teams at any company, but the fact that there is a top down value placed on work life balance and employee welfare really does have an effect on team culture.

Cons: Microsoft health insurance is VERY GOOD, but in many occasions, it's complicated to get your benefits. Most of providers won't accept it at first, even tho you can submit the claims to get reimbursed later for 99% of them. But that's time consuming and mostly a waste of time for the providers to have back-and-forth communications with you to confirm whether they can take you in or not. Therefore, it ultimately affects employees' productivity by distracting us to spend time on worthless work. 



Slow in promotion and increase. It takes multiple years (I've heard) to get promoted. The pay scale and pay raise aren't competitive enough given the context now (Big tech competition and inflation).

Cons: Getting promoted is tough. It's not enough that you deliver but you're expected to and keep your skip manager know about this. This is because your direct manager is busy with his own leveling-up. In my first 3 years there, our direct _did_not_ even introduced us to our skip.
Advice: They should review the promotion process again. It's just not that effective and seems like unfair to other folks
Pros: In my current role right now, here are the pros which I can also see pretty much from our sister groups (groups within the same org)

- flexible -&gt; as long as you deliver results on time, nobody cares where you are and what you do during the day;

- resources availability -&gt; you're in one of the biggest companies in the world and this should be a given ;)

Cons: Well below average pay in the tech industry

Your manager generally only cares about their own next move

People in the company seem think they are superior to employees at other company which is funny and take such pride in the Microsoft logo itself. Microsoft became their identities and it's sometime unbearable

Diversity and Inclusion: This is very INTERESTING here. because they do hire people with diverse background. I know someone in HR and I've been told by her as well as seen it myself that someone that is way more under qualified will get hired because they fulfill certain diversity quota. I personally know a friend who fulfill these "criteria", she has gone on an one month vacation without actually taking days off, manager noticed this and she still proceed to take one more week. HR cannot fire her because they need the PR and she still works there today while probably working 1 to 2 hours a week because she know she cannot be fired.

Pros: If you are knowledgeable in the Microsoft ecosystem, working at Microsoft itself is the place to be. I'm compensated very well, have flexible working hours, and have been given the unique tools I need to succeed. I think I'm appreciated and compensated fairly for the amount of value I provide, which isn't very common these days.

Advice: None
Pros: Culture, Growth Opportunities, Connections w/ Leadership

Cons: Salary compensation takes a big dip between years 3-6 which is when you see most folks at Microsoft leaving. I left close to year 4 to get my fair market price. Most people come back to Microsoft as a Senior PM or higher for work life balance and to chill. The majority of new hires have more than 7-10 years of experience. I noticed that I saw more Senior and Principal PMs than PM 2s towards the end of my career. Let that sink in. 

Microsoft is a Service provider. They care more about supporting more and more platforms and languages aka growing horizontally ("We need to support a Python on App Service, and Rust on App Service... and every other language and version!") than making what they have into a spectacular product. .NET releases and support takes up big chunks of dev time. Resources tend to get spread thin with so many things to support and less progress is made from a customer experience and feature set standpoint. 

The upper leadership moves very slowly and doesn't like taking risks. If you're a fast mover, you'll likely feel "slowed down" or "asked for further justification as to why it fits on the current roadmap" very often by upper leadership. If you're frustrated by this,
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft was so valuable in teaching me skills I could use to be an effective program manager at scale. Getting to interface with an external product with thousands of customers has been awesome and I've gotten to learn how to collaborate and create roadmaps with the technical writers, software engineers, and fellow PMs of my product. I also really loved getting to dive deep into customer telemetry and come up with data-driven decisions. Microsoft has a great infrastructure to do so.

I was fortunate enough to be a PM right out of college in Azure Developer Division which focuses on Developer tooling. I think Microsoft set me up with the enterprise-level industry experience that has made me a competitive candidate out in the market.

The people there are very intelligent and work hard within the bounds of a VERY healthy work life balance. People take plenty of vacation and days of throughout the year. I've loved the folks I've worked with for the most part and managers are awesome!

Cons: Many managers at the principal and above level do not exhibit those company values. In those same bands, it's common to see constant land grabs and people forcefully inserting themselves into workstreams to "add value."
Advice: None
Pros: Could be a con, but I love the inclusive and liberal values the company pursues. As a culture, with their training, semi-annual reviews, etc. there is a wide range of ways that try to make sure you understand and exhibit the values they espouse. Amazing benefits as well! It's great to feel like you're working for a company that is driving toward a greater good.

Cons: Many groups are over worked; new features prioritized over product stability
Advice: Don't rest on existing processes; work on improving them.
Pros: Team work prioritized. Management is supportive.

Pros: Kind company, and good perks.

Cons: It is a great company to work for, but a terrible company to get hired by.
Advice: None
Pros: Broad diversity of job opportunities (when we're hiring).

Cons: Management encourages and rewards a timid approach to new features and is self congratulatory for tiny shifts in metrics. We don't stay the course long enough to see the vision for a project end-to-end and ultimately ship watered down fragments to test the concept, which never gets revisited. There's a pervasive culture of leading with 'no' and risk aversion
Advice: Committed to the full scope of projects. They tend to have much bigger payoff for customers.
Pros: We're bringing in more diversity through the intern program. 

The company is very inclusive. A few examples: Every major event has both subtitles and a live ASL translator. Pronoun usage is encouraged to be inclusive to trans folk. There is a specific hiring program for autistic individuals.

Advice: How good your life will be depends entirely on your manager.
If you are unlucky your tenure will be short.

Microsoft does reorgs yearly it seems.
The management does not seem to match people with teams very well after a reorg.
If you end up in a team that is not a match the you are stuck and will have to look for another job.

Finding another position inside Microsoft will require that you interview again, exactly as if you applied from outside Microsoft.

There are many companies that pay much better and offer more interesting work.

I cannot recommend Microsoft.
Pros: Reasonable work life balance if you are in the right team

Cons: Pay is a bit lower
Advice: None
Pros: Believe in the things you do

Cons: Too much work, busy schedules/
Advice: None
Pros: Great environment they say, I think its true.

Cons: Vaccine mandate; Chaotic product planning; Bad Work/Life balance; Internal tools can be terrible; Politics win over technical excellence
Advice: This is advice for GPM (Group Program Manager) / skip-level managers on my most recent team in particular:

Don't sit in an ivory tower, separate from the day-to-day realities of engineers. Structure your communication channels in Teams such that the team actually feels like a team. For unknown reasons, our communication was spread out over multiple Teams groups: my team was forced to keep its channels in a Teams group for the larger org; I have no idea where the other engineering teams communicated with each other. I wasn't even sure what our org structure looked like - who worked on our product across the globe. We should have had an All-Hands meeting once per quarter - not once per year. Or maybe an update email here and there.

Perform user research BEFORE you ask engineers to implement a feature. On my team, most of the features we implemented got cut just before or just after they were finished - because user research had only just finished their testing (without using the stuff we had just built - so building it was unnecessary). Lots of engineering time was wasted, and it was demoralizing.

In addition, don't keep piling pressure on engineers along the lines of "We should have shipped already!" when PM / design / user research haven't even decided what we should be building!!! It's laughable to have a fixed launch date when you don't even know what your new product wants to be.

And if PM / design go through the process of cutting features in order to speed up the time to market, maybe involve engineers in that process. Otherwise you might end up creating MORE work instead of reducing it!! Re-designing an entire website &amp; adding new features in response to feature cuts is NOT how you reduce work for engineers!!

The good news: My immediate manager was competent. Most GPMs and skip-levels at Microsoft are more competent than the leadership of my most recent team. It was a mess.
Pros: Nice People; WFH; Job security; Yammer (internal social media); Lots of DLs/groups; Mature engineering practices

Cons: When there's a re-org happening, cross your fingers and wish that your nice boss doesn't get kicked out. Nothing worse than a dishonest and selfish manager that only seeks his own benefit.
Advice: None
Pros: It really depends on which team you work in.

Cons: Pay for work experience is low.. can't retain experienced folks
Advice: None

Advice: None

Advice: Please find leaders who truly embrace Microsoft value and not just talk about it during Poll time.
Pros: Culture can be quite different between teams. If you land in the right team with supportive peers, you'll enjoy the work.

Advice: None

Cons: Promo velocity low especially once you get to L65
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance across

Cons: the location is not bad
Advice: None
Pros: it is ok to start with

Cons: The main complaint I hear from people leaving Microsoft is that they want to make more money or get promoted. 

As I mentioned in the pros, turn over at MS is pretty low by design. But that does mean that compared to other places, the opportunity for promotion and big raises is smaller as well. Generally people either leave by year 2 or stay for 7 to 8 years at least. There's a lot of people who have been there for a very, very long time. 

Also, good work life balance and culture is the stated goal at Microsoft and most teams seem to follow it, but not every team is the same. 

There are a lot of different teams at MS and reorgs seem to be fairly common -- though it seems about the same as at any large company, not particularly bad here.

My team only just started doing sprints. For the previous year plus I've worked here, I've struggled without the framework of agile that I'd become used to at previous work places. It's getting better on my team, and I know that's super team dependent as well.
Advice: This is a great place to work, but only because I'm on a team with a good manager. Most managers seem to be good managers here.
Pros: I started at Microsoft a few months into the pandemic and from day 1 I've experienced management as compassionate and committed to taking care of people as people. 

Crunch has been rare on my team. 

I work on a service large enough that I'm only the on call engineer about once every 3 months. 

Perks+ benefits -- a yearly reimbursement amount of $1500 for health and wellness things. Personally I've used it to reimburse meal kits, a peloton subscription, pet insurance, and a massage envy membership. The list is really expansive. 

The average tenure at MS on my team is around 7 years. People stay a really long time because the philosophy is that they'd rather have you take a break than lose all the expertise you've  gained. Being such a large company, the code bases are large and the history is long on pretty much all the projects. The longer they keep you, the more valuable you become. More on that in the cons.

There's plenty of room to move internally when you're ready to do something different, and internal hiring is very common.

Specifically on coming out as transgender at Microsoft:
My wife and I pay zero dollars for our health insurance and have a copay of $20 for any doctor in the Kaiser system. The trans healthcare is especially affordable -- just $100 for any of the gender reassignment procedures. The wait lists are about 6 months for a transgender surgical consult, which isn't terribly short but it's certainly worse other places.  

There's an internal transgender community that has worldwide members. They've been an incredible support and place to belong. Changing my name and pronouns has been completely painless. A lot of my team is virtual and I've never been misgendered or dead named. I didn't even announce it beyond telling my manager and saying in my team chat "Hey I'm going by X now and updating my pronouns to y" and everyone just said great, congrats, and started using it.

Advice: None
Pros: My team was pretty great- friendly, welcoming and collaborative

Cons: No cons, just working remote is hard
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is awesome

Cons: This is not a tenured employer. So, when they decide to do cuts, it doesn't matter that you've been there 10 years and Joe from down the hall 3 months.... If your position is being eliminated you are out!
Advice: None
Pros: The benefits and work/life balance

Cons: It is a giant company. You may get to influence your immediate work group, but the company as a whole may make decisions you don't really agree with.
Advice: None
Pros: They really try and take care of you. Was recently terminated due to layoff of a 200+ person group. They gave a great severance package that will last us a long time (1 to 1.5 years).

Cons: Too ambiguous. "Grow your accounts" Okay. How? With what tools?
Unfulfilling. Job is very soft skills oriented so what you actually do can be tough to qualify.
Compensation. Has recently improved but still pales in comparison to complementary roles internally or similar roles externally.
Advice: None
Pros: Extremely flexible. You can live your life as fully as you could ever expect to as a full-time member of the work force.

Relatively low effort. The actual tasks are not difficult but you have to keep yourself on track with the communications and schedules

Cons: career growth is slow, unless you have a good sponsor
Advice: Improve upward mobility based on performance, boomerang employees get up-leveled far more easily and quickly than people who have been at the company for 5 plus years. Loyalty does not seem to pay here.
Pros: open, flexible work environment, no micro-management

Cons: Many old timers in top level management who talk about D&amp;I but do not follow it. Retaliated and bullied by manager for raising a D&amp;I issue despite strong evidence. HR didn’t act to rectify either. D&amp;I is just in the books but not in practice at all: Some internal processes are extremely slow. Promotions are highly subjective and seem based on tenure instead of performance. Got top performer of the year last year and after raising a D&amp;I issue within 3 months , moved to bottom most performer despite all kudos and appreciation from 360 peer feedback. Ratings are at the mercy of the manager!
Advice: Standup for what is right and do not support old timers just because of their tenure in the company . Makes the work place very toxic. Make performance ratings mix of a manger feedback and 360 peer feedback. Take away undue bullying power from 1st line management and do weighted average score from 360 feedback for performance.
Pros: Great company benefits. You can see some great people managers and leaders but also not so capable and very egoistic/arrogant who are still with the company due to their tenure. Leads to a toxic web of management circle sometimes due to their relationship with each other over years. Makes any good thing hard to surface after layers of politics.

Cons: no free food nothing much really good job
Advice: None
Pros: pretty good flexible hours flexible pay

Cons: most likely, not assistance in education for the family kids. community enhancement support
Advice: None
Pros: Family benefits, health insurance, retirement, incentives, breaktimes...

Cons: Is the Corporate BusDev team a deal team or a strategy team? The LT seems to be indexing toward the latter, not the former latetly. Newer hires are increasingly ex-consultants who are great at powerpoint but don't know how to manage or negotiate a deal or partnership, yet BusDev management expects them to advise CVPs and CEOs. Small size of the group means limited career opportunities especially once you hit Director level.

Pros: Microsoft has great talent and processes

Cons: Mildly Political Corporate Climate - Difficult to Move Internally without Intensive Networking
Advice: None
Pros: Great Work Life Balance and People

Cons: Microsoft touts a diverse and inclusive community, but I found that it was not accurate. The executives may come from all different areas of the world, but they are all from similar educational backgrounds, which means it lacks diversity in "thought" and to push against that is very difficult, if you have been at Microsoft less than several years.  They recruit a lot of people to join the company, since they are losing people to the competition and better salaries, but people that have been at the company for more than 15 years, make it very difficult for new people with "ideas", so the politics are hard to navigate. There are people that are trying to bring innovation to the company, but most of them are frustrated and have given up trying to make any significant changes to the culture or innovation, until they can find a new gig. 



Since new people are not very much embraced by the people that have been there for a long time, progress is very very slow. Primarily, why Microsoft does well in the market, is because they have a good brand, due to the leadership of Satya, but that's the reason, not due to innovation.



Many long-time "Softies" lack expertise in their work subjects, so they utilize agencies for most of the strategy and execution. If you really want to participate in the innovation of product or strategy, then I would suggest working for one of their many consultant agencies.



People are on Microsoft Teams all day, every day. There's no respect for people's time and people are constantly late for meetings, since they are stuck on the previous meeting. Executives assume that all day meetings = work, which it doesn't. Work still has to be conducted, so people don't write or work , until the end of the day, when they can finally get off a Teams meeting.
Advice: If you really want to have diversity and inclusion at Microsoft, then modernize as the other tech companies have during the pandemic, and allow for different types of people of thought. Please look beyond hiring in Redmond for talent or forcing outside talent to relocate to Washington. Also, there are so many executives that have been at Microsoft for 25 years that hold back the innovation and don't allow for other's opinions, hire executives that you will respect their voices. It's good to listen  and stop suppressing new ideas.



Lastly, managers need to limit the amount of meetings they have in a day,  as well as , having all of their workers on the meeting, which many times are unnecessary. Staffs are afraid of not joining a meeting, since managers will penalize them. Managers need to trust their staffs and conduct less meetings to create efficiency.  Workers are burning out, since they are stuck on 7 - 10 Teams meetings per day. Having so many Teams meetings doesn't encourage a healthy work/life balance.
Pros: The health benefits and perks programs are great. Total compensation is comparative, but base salary is less than the other big Tech companies. For middle management salaries, it's a great place to be, but for executives, they are not as competitive as an AWS or Google.



Satya is great and truly is inspirational for trying to change the culture of the company.

Cons: Pay is less than expectation stock refresh is low
Advice: None
Pros: Hybrid work environment, WFH possibility good company culture No stack ranking

Great work life balance and focus on D+I

Cons: not so stable as before
Advice: None
Pros: really an equal opportunity employer

Cons: good and bad at times
Advice: None
Pros: bad for some time but really

Cons: - the pay is quite low comparatively
- very poor stock refreshers mean staying long term isn't feasible 
- culture is very team and manager dependent
- re-orgs are common, meaning you can't count on your team culture staying the same
- pushes everyone to participate in diversity and inclusion initiatives but doesn't reward those who do
Advice: - recognize and reward D&amp;I work
- consider better stock refreshers
- the culture is good, but not good enough to justify the low pay

- not a blame based culture

Advice: None
Pros: - Pretty good work-life balance especially in you're in an org which has mature products like Office

- No Micro-managers. Nobody stressing you about when you start work. Managers care more-so about your ability to get your work done, so highly flexible in terms of work hours.

- If you work on weekends, or after-hours that's seen as a negative because the idea is that you didn't manage your time wisely during the work week

- Unlike some other tech companies who are prioritizing employees needing to come into the office several times a week, Microsoft strongly adopts the hybrid model of work. You can choose to work fully in the office, half, or fully remote. Up to you and the discretion of your manager/org

Cons: Stuck up managers, could use listening to new (er) perspsectives
Advice: Open up to other perspectives, just because this is the only company you have worked in for all of your career doesn't mean that your opinion is the only valid one.

Advice: None
Pros: Customers are nice. Played with new tech

Cons: Microsoft is a large company, and there are definitely still pockets of management that do not subscribe to the new culture, preferring to micromanage and exert a top down pressure to conform

Also, being a large company, your progress in your career is somewhat slower

Managers mostly actually care, and your feedback is respected

Cons: some people have bad hygiene.
Advice: fire John.
Pros: The community in Microsoft is one of the best I've ever experienced in a workplace to date.

Cons: If you're on a service team, the on-call rotations can be pretty long and bad. If you're driven to write well-tested code, and hold your teams to high standards, you likely won't have the dev hours allocated to do so.
Advice: None
Pros: Work-life balance is pretty good, and benefits are great.

Cons: So far so good working for MSF
Advice: None
Pros: Good job working as SM at MSFT

Cons: Less experience than onsite intern
Advice: None
Pros: The mentor is really helpful

Cons: Microsoft has many reorgs where you will leave your team and be placed in another team.
You will have no ability to choose your new team and not even know until the day of the reorg which is your new team.
And switching teams is really hard, most times will require an entire interview loop.

Given the number of reorgs and the many random team reassignments it is very likely that if you stay long enough you will end in a bad team for you.

So, do you feel yourself lucky ?
Advice: When doing a reorg the affected people should have input into which new teams they end.

Advice: Customer is king. What have you one for the customer lately?
Pros: Vertically integrated company that has a lot to offer to its customers

Cons: - Your experience here is completely dependent on the team that you get placed on. They preach "growth mindset" at the VP level, and then by the team it trickles down to the individual contributors it is a toxic environment, "old school Microsoft culture". 
- Backstabbing and overworking is rewarded
- Often times 24 availability is required, but not listed as part of the job requirements
- Internal movement in impossible unless you are Senior level. You are ghosted even internally
Advice: Practice what you preach and stop rewarding VPs who overwork and pressure those they are responsible for.
Pros: + Good pay
+ Literally nothing else

Cons: Latest re-org was very upsetting on so many levels, does not feel like a lot of common sense was involved.
Advice: I do feel they are trying to “right the ship”. It’s just a little more painful than it probably had to be.

Advice: Make the Microsoft Store actually feel like part of the company, and do a lot more to ensure that the workplace environment is healthy both physically and emotionally.
Pros: Great benefits, including tuition reimbursement, discounts, and even some free services.

Cons: lower compensation compared to other tech company
Advice: None
Pros: decent place for growth at early stage

Cons: Many previous benefits like work life balance are starting to disappear. This exacerbates the tension over low compensation. Further there is a growing concern over new hires coming in with little to no experience at higher pay than high performing employees due to the discrepancy in retention and acquisition team budgets.
Advice: I would recommend adjusting the retention to acquisition team budgets as managers often in good faith will tell high performing employees to leave and come back in order to obtain market level compensation. This likely is costing Microsoft a tremendous amount and appears that Microsoft has to pay a premium for returning employees when they could have paid marginally more initially to increase employee satisfaction and productivity.
Pros: Microsoft prides itself on its culture.

Advice: None
Pros: Work Life Balance Moderate Pay Average Leadership

Cons: Low pay and it seems it will not get any better..
Advice: Increase the pay for senior band technical scientists by 20-35% to keep your top talent or FAANG would be happy/honored to keep poaching your top technical talents .. Not many great engineer/scientists would stay with Microsoft long term due to the aggressive offers top companies make to poach MSFT technical talents. CEO has done very small to address the lack of competitive total pay for senior (level 64 -66) scientists/engineers at MSFT.
Pros: good work life balance.

Pros: Everything was a good point in my view

Cons: Microsoft's mission is to empower every person and company to achieve more but it often doesn't practice that in reality.

Employee growth is touted as a vitally important part of their corporate culture with various constructs and processes that seem to also encourage this. However, no matter the policies, procedures or training, my experience has been nothing but the opposite.

In my time, i've witnessed ableism towards colleagues that had disabilities and even myself once I developed a disability that I partially contribute to my experiences.

I've also heard stories of Racism and discrimination too.

Managers, teams etc were always talking in secret, sabotaging each others projects. Referring to each other negatively. Playing political games to get things done and generally making my life miserable.

Eventually, I started struggling in my position beyond the above issues. I developed anxiety, stress and depression. The heightened level of anxiety in everything at work lead to me dreading starting work.

The pandemic actually helped, at least I didn't have to be physically in the same location as the people who were causing the issues.

During this time, I developed stress caused epilepsy. Too much stress I get a seizure... yay

My manager never helped with these issues despite me asking. 
My skip level booked some meetings with me but always left early and said they'd re-schedule. They never did.
HR of course is a no-go, they're designed to protect the company and don't really care about you.

I felt I had nowhere to turn to, with my mental health declining and my sense of self worth flying out the window I had to leave.

I'm exceptionally disappointed

Call me Neurodiverse or whatever you want

Advice: None
Pros: Work culture Pay Peer Tech Benefits Comp

Cons: Let's be real. No company is perfect. Work is work. But for sake of not being "everything is perfect,"



- It's a huge company. The endless abyss of information, acronyms, jargon, etc can be obnoxious. Onboarding can be comical. Where do I find xyz? What's actually important? What version of comparable documents is the "right" one? But that's easily combatted by asking someone who knows.



- Huge company means lots of "hurry up and wait." Let's be honest, that's frustrating. You're bound to encounter differing opinions and such. "Looks good, but ope, now there's feedback from another group, and now we need approval from xyz. Glad I stressed about this yesterday when it turns out it's gonna sit for another week.
Advice: None
Pros: Whether they genuinely care about their employees as humans or not, they at least do a darn good job of acting like they do. Microsoft is a rare company that understands "if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your company."



- I dare you to find a better 401k match. 50% on any contribution amount, up to the government's limit. AND it vests immediately. It's yours from day one. Literally $10,250 of free money on top of normal compensation.



- Healthcare is great. Tier 1 in the US for sure. Maybe there's a couple companies out there with better coverage. But Microsoft doesn't charge you for it. Literally zero dollars out of the employee's paycheck. There's a fee to add a spouse or domestic partner denying their own company's coverage, but that's fair. Also no added cost for dependents. That's amazing.



Parental leave. They match the WA State policy of 12 weeks (+ more for birth mothers). It's super easy to take advantage of, and it's available Day 1 of employment. It's unfortunate that this benefit feels "special" in the US, but I'm thankful for it.



- Base is competitive. But actually competitive. Not how bs companies say it as a way to compete with you for the lowest pay possible. They get it. They need and want to get quality people, and keep them at Microsoft.



- Any negative culture stigmas from a couple decades ago are gone. The culture now is relentlessly supportive and accommodating. Work life balance is preached. We're all adults here, trusting other adults to do their job, regardless of what hours they need to do it.



- Signing bonus + stock bonus + annual bonus. Work hard, get more. Beautiful.



I've historically cringed at people who spewed love for their company on Glassdoor. It always screamed "I'm and HR drone posting fake reviews to cover up all the bad ones." But here I am. Not an HR drone, a real human grateful to be in the Microsoft bubble. Believe it or not.

Cons: Toxic culture persists from Balmer era, "golden boys" are rewarded in spite of bad behavior, product silos are at war, outdated mindset, "somebody else will make it usable"
Advice: Conflict aversion doesn't solve the real problems the company is facing. You have to get rid of bad actors and remove cross company barriers or you'll never move forward.

Empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more cannot be accomplished with a stubborn insistence that the primary market is office workers and professional developers - especially after funding OpenAI.

Pros: Best work life balance and perks

Cons: Politics. Some mid level management is very political and does not have a backbone. They sacrify what is best for the company and shareholders, for their own personal benefit. Wont push back to senior leaders and are very complacent. Also there are some managers that will use your work and present it as their work. The review and bonus structure is highly subjective and unfair.
Advice: Vet you managers better, left the company twice as I got stuck with bad managers who were only put in those positions for promotion and not for their leadership.

Cons: Work-life balance, managers too empowered
Advice: The company is unmistakably amazing, it has outstanding values, great benefits, and an overall culture that makes you feel part of the family, you learn all the time and it has an amazing diversity and inclusion spirit. Work-life balance isn't so great, and you can end up working sunrise to sunset to meet objectives, and your results are only reviewed by your manager. Great managers give you the best experience of your life; not-so-great managers make life unbearable.

Cons: If you're below a certain job level (e.g., L65), Microsoft is really cheap on your total compensation compared to other big technology companies like Meta, Alphabet, or Amazon. People have been leaving in droves during the great resignation to go to competitors that have been paying more, and Microsoft is now realizing it needs to do something to stop the bleeding of early and mid-career to competitors and startups. 



Despite knowing employees are unhappy with compensation in this high inflation &amp; high gas cost environment, the company leadership isn't doing anything transformational that makes Microsoft the leader when it comes to compensation. The company is doing across the board salary cuts between 10% and 15% for employees in certain states like Texas, Florida, and Georgia (no exceptions), and this is in no way beneficial to the employees in these states as they try to grow their presence and recruit people there.



Microsoft is also a "rest and vest" culture where there have been people who have stayed at the company for 20+ years and don't have to do much work. If you're looking for a place to increase your career trajectory velocity, definitely look somewhere else. Career progression is super slow at the company. If you've got an advanced degree, Microsoft won't compensate you extra for that either. Think more than twice before opting to take a job at Microsoft - especially if you're a new grad.
Advice: Stop being cheap and actually be competitive with your total compensation and benefits. Other big tech peers (and even startups) are steamrolling you in this category while senior leadership continues to tell people "think about the work-life balance that you get". It is frustrating and makes people feel not valued at all. I know you're thinking about keeping the SG&amp;A line item on the balance sheet minimal and trying to maximize net operating income by keeping salaries cheap, but it is a terrible long term strategy for attracting and retaining good people. Also, if you're going to cut salaries of people in different states without telling them (after they have moved there during the pandemic), at least come forward with explaining why you think their new lower salary is good and attractive for them. I know you wouldn't do that, but some explanation is better than no explanation.
Pros: I really like the benefits that are offered by Microsoft - they actually do a good job here. That is the only reason I gave 2 stars to the ratings for "Compensation and Benefits" - the benefits lift it up. Otherwise, it would be a one-star rating for that category.

Cons: Overly hostile and political environment, esp in India region.
Advice: "Diversity" is being overly abused in Microsoft India. It is wrongly interpreted as "all-women organization" in many cases. Efforts are made to eliminate male candidates during interviews on "diversity" reasons. Even some male employees are made to leave the organization to be replaced by female employees again on "diversity" reasons. Hence "Diversity" is very feministically interpreted and implemented.



I hope top leaders of Microsoft see this post and do something significant about this. Please note, diversity does not mean "keep all ladies around". It is totally different.
Pros: Technology Leader, Strong Processes, High Learning Opportunities

Cons: Management of Mixed Reality division is clueless. Doesn't care that everyone is jumping ship to other companies. Thinks it is just regular "turnover". WTF??!! With literally dozens upon dozens that have left?

Excellent support for remote work

Advice: continuous learning is important but the support to bring your employees along with change requirements is stale, jobs requirements and reorgs happen almost quarterly now it seems, but your everyday work still has to get done + learn new requirements for your ever-changing job description, also still some bad managers that gossip and have clicky behavior like a high school, once an employee has push back with manager you almost get targeted and it becomes personal.

Cons: Could be more inclusive and welcoming
Advice: None
Pros: They're into everything now and it shows

Cons: It's very hard to explain without having lived it, but it's all politics. It's who you know over what you know. People are quick to judge you based on your looks and attitude. I'm not sure how/why it's bred this culture but they're not as "inclusive" as they seem. They breed an incredibly competitive culture where it's the norm to be incredibly selfish and highly judgemental of everyone and their work (they call it "being critical" and "defining impact").



Every day coming to work it was more a game of "watch your back you don't know who's trying to sabotage you" today.

Cons: Not my favorite employer in career

Pros: Not the best at all

Cons: “Top heavy, everyone trying to get to high level jobs instead of doing their jobs. Higher levels taking credit for work done by their employees. Very internally focused, MS competes more internally than it does externally.”
Advice: Job is really hard coming into it from a programming background. Product knowledge is not abundant. It seems I'm not getting as much support as I would like. 😕 I honestly have no idea what else to put.

Pros: Great place with fantastic culture

Cons: Your overall experience at Microsoft is very team dependent, with some organizations' actions contradicting the values set by the company's mission statement. This manifests in poor cross-team communication, misalignment of interests between teams, and tribalism. This leads to a poor collaborative culture where every team acts only in the best interests of their own team, and not for the company as a whole. How can you empower every person and every organization in the world if you can't even empower your own employees?

Compensation is not as competitive as other FAANG companies. While Microsoft comp is still very good compared to most non-FAANG companies, this signals that Microsoft is not willing to take the initiative to be competitive with their main competitors. What ends up happening is that the best talent ends up leaving for greener pastures and all the mediocre ones stay, causing a "brain drain" where engineering standards steadily decrease. Microsoft is not interested in retaining its best talents contrary to their claims.

It is much easier to interview external companies than it is to switch to different organization. If you want to transfer to a different organization within Microsoft (say, from Windows to Xbox), you have to apply to a job posting created by the organization of interest and go through an interview loop as if you're an external applicant. Assuming they even read your application, you being a Microsoft employee gives you no advantage as the loop does not take into account your positive Connects, manager testimonials, etc. I've made more progress in a few months' worth of external interviewing than I did trying to transfer internally for years. Yes, Microsoft is entrenched in various markets, but you most likely won't be able to enter most of them unless if you boomerang or have insider connections (which is outside of your control). Again, Microsoft is not interested in retaining talent despite Microsoft selling you on the idea that they want to keep and cultivate talent.

Work life balance is a hit or miss depending on several variables such as team dynamics, your seniority level, and the quality of your team's engineering processes. In my team, engineers are put in oncall rotations with little to no training in the product area, poor organization of information, and not being taught to take initiative in solving problems. This leaves the most senior, competent, and knowledgeable engineers being put on 24/7 virtual oncall where they can get pinged/paged/called/etc during off hours by engineers that are officially oncall but couldn't/wouldn't find relevant information themselves. I've even been texted several times to come online and help with an issue, WHILE I WAS ON VACATION!

Furthermore, if you're perceived as a competent engineer, expect to be stretched thin with increased responsibilities but little to no resources to deliver on said responsibilities. This led to competent engineers burning out while the mediocre ones are able to coast by. Even when brought up in one-on-ones, the issue was dismissed with a nonchalant "we tried but we can't fix it" response. It's almost as if Microsoft rewards mediocrity more than competency. There is an ongoing myth about Microsoft being the pinnacle of work life balance, but I find that it's mostly true if you're junior or are unmotivated.

Microsoft claims to be customer obsessed and seeks to offer a delightful customer experience, but my experiences with seeing poor development practices and seeing products fail the most basic use cases (implying a lack of quality testing) lead me to believe this is just another buzzword. Microsoft is more concerned about crossing off checkmarks and delivering fast rather than being honest about their products and taking corrective action. This leads to technical debt, loss of morale, and burnout.

On a slightly unrelated note; even during my tenure at Microsoft, I've favored competing products over Microsoft's counterpart. I'll use Google Docs over Word any day, Dropbox over OneDrive, and I ended up selling my Xbox One but kept my PS4. I'm not familiar with the teams behind those products, but based on my experiences here, I wouldn't be surprised if their lack of quality translated to my dissatisfaction with those products.

tl;dr your mileage may vary at Microsoft as each team is different, so be prepared to jump ship if your working conditions don't line up with their promises and your own expectations. I recommend Microsoft as either a resume booster or as a place to retire.
Advice: If you truly believe in the company's values such as customer obsession, cultivating talent, and growth mindset, walk the talk. Don't just talk the talk. Otherwise, employees who actually practice those values will leave for your competitors.
Pros: Good benefits like health care, 401k matching, donation matching, access to counseling service, etc.

Microsoft is entrenched in a wide range of markets from office productivity, gaming, search, mixed reality, etc.

Can find coworkers with a wide range of interests and hobbies outside of work, such as sports and gaming. Lots of internal mailing lists for different hobbies to facilitate meetups and community building.

Creative outlets in the form of yearly hackathons and The Garage, an independent group inside Microsoft that coordinates smaller hackathons and guest speakers relevant for certain topics such as game development and virtual reality.

Good place to retire or to jump start your resume.

Advice: None

Very aggressive environments created by teams for artificial purposes.

Very stratified teams based on language.

Adopt current trends and technologies quicker.
Advice: Improve work life balance.

Break up teams that have a very homogeneous make up.

Add quarterly surveys and trainings regarding diversity and inclusion efforts on teams. An hour video of training on diversity per year leads to really funny and insensitive comments and conflicts that might result in the company losing its reputation and worse.

Improve training opportunities for new technology.
Pros: Vast choices of technology to work on.

Lots of smart and productive people.

Beautiful main campus in the Seattle area.

Software teams able to make decisions without interference from upper management, at least at the medium and lower levels.

Cons: are you kidding me ?
Advice: None
Pros: super great and very good

Cons: Microsoft offers below average compensation. Their stated goal is to offer compensation that is the 66th percentile of their competitors. In a letter grate that is a D. The promotion opportunities at Microsoft are severely limited. The best way to get paid more is to leave and come back.
Advice: The reason you are losing employees to Google and Facebook is not complicated. The reason is because you refuse to pay us as much. Even after Satya's announcement of increased compensation, it still won't match what I can get by going to Google or Facebook. That is why I am voting with my feet.

Cons: -Total comp is lower compared with other competitors but still good overall

Advice: None
Pros: Benefits go down the drain

Cons: High Pressure: The fast-paced and competitive nature of the tech industry at Samsung Electronics can be quite demanding. The high expectations and tight deadlines sometimes led to a stressful work environment.

Work-Life Balance: Due to the demanding nature of the job, maintaining a work-life balance was challenging at times. Long working hours were often required to meet project deadlines and achieve goals.

Organizational Hierarchy: The company's large size and complex organizational structure sometimes made decision-making processes slow. Navigating through the hierarchy to implement changes or get approvals could be time-consuming.

Job Security: As with many large corporations, job security can be an issue due to the constant drive for innovation and restructuring. This uncertainty can be a source of concern for employees.
Advice: None
Pros: Innovative Projects: Working at Samsung Electronics provided the opportunity to be involved in cutting-edge technology and innovative projects. This exposure allowed me to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and gain valuable experience in a highly competitive field.

Professional Growth: The company offers a dynamic and challenging environment that promotes continuous learning and professional development. The emphasis on excellence and quality helped me enhance my skills and grow in my career.

Global Impact: Samsung Electronics is a global leader in the tech industry, and being part of this organization allowed me to contribute to products that have a significant impact worldwide. This experience was both rewarding and inspiring.

Collaborative Culture: The work environment at Samsung encourages collaboration and teamwork. I had the chance to work with talented and skilled professionals from diverse backgrounds, which enriched my professional experience.

Cons: This review considate a few common feedback by peers who left. The department is toxic due to the head (G****l). 
Scolding, gaslighting is a norm.
Top management tried to prohibit such behavior, but ended up only moving occurrence from public to slightly secluded area.

Poor career path as higher position normally held by korean. 

The subsidiary culture is inclined to pleasing management to HQ. New project launch each year just for the sake of reporting and KPI. management will highly focus on the project when it is 'seen' by HQ. Previous in progress projects will be neglected, and the person who handles the project will suffer. 

As I didn't work in another department, these comments are only applicable to innovation teams in SME .But the turnover is high as a whole subsidiary.
Advice: Look into high turnover department, give proper training for the head, or assign someone who are actually capable.
Pros: Good colleague. But most of them left.

Cons: - Terrible local management. Yelling, screaming and passive aggression are normal and to be expected. 
- Micromanagement is a standard. You should do what you are told to do, but when that does not work - it’s your fault.
- All the rumors about local Samsung are true.
- Aside from bonuses, you get no benefits. You have to pay participation for health insurance, and there is nothing else. 
- I’m not sure if anyone used their vacations days (bare minimum of 20), you should be grateful you are using any at all.
Advice: Advice is for HR to do their job. It is unbelievable how the bounce rate in some teams is super high and no one is doing anything.
Pros: - Bonuses 
- Big system, you can learn how everything functions
- There are some great people, unfortunately suffering in this work culture

Pros: Good work life balance. Management good.

Cons: Nothing to say here :)
Advice: None
Pros: It is good to be here

Cons: One of the most toxic cultures I worked in. Colleagues and managers were emotionally burnt out, which was very draining. Bad and toxic behaviours are tolerated, especially from high management. I have seen countless people having to take sick leave from being over-worked.
The main issue is cultural, which comes from the Head Quarters in Korea. Their priority is NOT people or employees, even if they state it in their company values. All they care is about financial results, and squeezing every inch of blood and energy someone has to give. Additionally, there's no diversity at all. 90% of senior leaders are male, either Korean or white. This doesn't improve much in mid-management.
Don't be fooled by the name or by a high paycheck, and avoid yourself hours of therapy, anxiety and bad health. Stay away from Samsung.

koreans are very trusted and they have full authority regardless of their seniority.
No work life balance, you need always to check whatsapp and emails even at night, calls and meetings during weekend for unnecessary things that can be done during the week day.
The company on sense of urgency through out the year, you always feel that they will bankrupt at any moment(although they wont but they give that impression)

Cons: **Review: Avoid This Company**

Working at this company has been a frustrating and stressful experience. The direction changes every week, leading to confusion and a lack of clear goals. The high-pressure environment makes it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a stable and supportive work environment.

Advice: Improve retention
Pros: Good work culture and benefits

Cons: ...however their values get trashed by the culture which is about running around like a headless chicken, spinning wheels, doing things that don't really add any value just to look busy. Expertise is frowned upon in favour of just spinning wheels and wasting time on pointless leadership team appeasement. Empowerment non-existent in favour of box-ticking for leadership. Very little learning and development at all after the probation period. The epitome of that definition of madness where they just want to do the same thing over and again expecting a different result...but they never get it. Understanding of data and statistics is almost non-existent, with the rule being that it's only used to prove the opinion of the person using it, never to open up learning to inform action. Leadership team is an assortment of people from failed enterprises, not successful and market-beating ones. No internal job move opportunities unless you've been on the grad scheme, then it's a case of rolling out the red carpet. Made a big song and dance about having work-life balance but then those without kids or a significant interest in life outside the 8-6 set the tone for what's expected and aggressively hound those whose work isn't their life. Any expertise you offer will at best be slyly appropriated by the audience and no credit will be given to the source at all - this is the worst organisation I've ever been in for this sort of thing; at worst you'll be openly told off for daring to have an original thought.

Advice: None
Pros: Great discounts for all samsung appliances

Cons: - Mentally prepare to see your hard work be destroyed by utterly incompetent local management, over and over again. - HQ leadership / mindset are very good, but often out of touch with what really goes on in this department. - Forget about career progression here, local management goal is to do as less as possible while getting away with it. If you oppose this mindset you will be targeted and gaslighted, they'll go far and wide to protect their little circle. - For these reasons this was by far the most toxic and depressing place I've personally ever worked, with reasonably crazy high turn-overs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You have been warned. That been said, my advice to you is: give it a shot and see how it goes, but always keep an opened mind and be ready to jump off.
Advice: Stop playing games or leave the chair to someone that knows what he's doing and he's willing to commit for the project and his team. Stop antagonizing HQ and talking behind their back, dumping on them the responsibility of your own failures. Stop the lies, manipulations and gatekeeping. Such behavior is not doing you any good, it promotes toxicity and ultimately will lead to your own downfall. Best of luck and farewell

Cons: Getting promoted is nearly impossible (there’s certain rules, like limiting the number of people to be promoted, etc). The salary increases, but not as much or as quickly as it should. Forced work from the office 3 times a week after work from home during covid had brought the company better results.
Advice: If there is a system to grade employees, but then you limit the amount of people that can be graded well (cause it implies promotion that is for only a few people), then it is not fair. People that do exceptional work are graded as “average” just because of this system. And there’s lots of very talented people in the AI team. Don’t force people to work from the office if they perform better working from somewhere else.

Cons: Samsung is the "big dog" in Korea, everyone wants to work there. It is a matter of honor to work there. So they work like slaves. They sleep at work under their desks as they are putting in 16 to 18 hr days regularly. If they get fired they won't easily get hired elsewhere. So they work incredibly hard and expect the same from everyone else. In Aus we have other options. What they do is not necessary. So they consider us lazy. I told them they are slaves. They hated me. They are 100% data-driven. It's not OK to hit 95% or even 105% you have to hit your target 100% every time. You get reviewed weekly, not monthly. If you can handle the stress it's fine. If not you won't last. If you can last though then other people know how tough Samsung is and you can get jobs easily elsewhere. They know you can handle.

Pros: Global company, pay well, great calture, European flavour

Cons: Chaotic, disorganized culture, lack of direction within teams. You'll do the job for at least a year or two before you actually get the promotion. Heavy reliance on early talent to fill gaps puts strain on teams. Lack of transparency from senior management. The recent restructuring showed a major lack of strategy with many high performers let go and low performers kept putting major strains on teams and thereby PEOPLE. Tough work-life balance as the environment is unstable.
Advice: Lean into managers and seniors on teams when planning a restructuring to avoid leaving teams in shambles with select high performers left to keep fort with low performers staying on but not pulling any weight. Get transparent - none of the tough questions were directly answered, rather run around with foggy responses. Create a space for true, open, honest feedback from your employees, especially during the most difficult times. Stop tooting the benefits plan in compensation conversations, all large orgs and most small now offer benefits packages, this is standard industry practice. Make it right: Seek to bring back the major talent that was given away and eliminate the burden of low performers.

Pros: Flexible working, big office, plenty of autonomy, opportunities for development and moving departments.

Cons: Workload imbalance. Instead of hiring best people for process improvement or consultants - they guise continuous improvement efforts in games and targets that every employee must reach. They would tire people out on delivering cost efficient measures and most that an employee can get is some pennies along with a high five. No, they don't patent ideas - they claim it as the company's.
Advice: Hire a consultant, hire the best so they can pass it on - they can develop people. Don't preach about work life balance when you would send a message on a Sunday night asking people to check their laptop since a truck needs to be rescheduled.
Pros: They are very particular with the safety of their people, whatever aspect it can be. The company would provide all of the things one needs, including the best healthcare privileges and allowances. Their benefits are top tier coming from a person who has worked in a number of multinational companies.

Cons: Leaders are horrible - they aren't classed as leaders but more like BOSSES! Very biased and racist leaders. They DO NOT care for their employees at all. Luckily John the so called CPO has left the company. Although his title says Chief People Officer, he is not at all a people person. Alec who is a so called Head of Comms, just doesn't know how to communicate with the business in his comms and ends up being very harsh in his articles that end up hurting employee's feelings (very arrogant and shrewd person). Managers on the floor as well aren't very great. If you're working for Shell Energy - you're just another number for them making them money. People don't last long there because the work culture isn't good at all. This place is filled with bossy and arrogant people. No scope for development. You will only get a chance to develop if you are good buddies with the bosses!
Advice: Appreciate your employees. If you do it - do it fairly. Help your employees to grow and develop. Don't tell them how to do their JOB - they are hired for a reason, instead give them tools to excel and grow in what they are hired for. Don't just sack people just because they don't agree with your way of thinking... Instead hear out and listen to their views - it will help you being open minded not narrow minded! By giving your employees a fair chance to grow it will not only benefit them but in the long run it will benefit your company. Happy employees = Happy clients and Great customer service + great company culture. Yes Financial goals are important however employees should be kept at the heart of anything you do (remember actions speak louder than words).

Pros: Good commission and nice cars

Cons: Worst place for a Software Engineer to make any kind of career. Every single department is a disaster, ego tripping everywhere, everyone is trying to reach the end of the month to get their salaries for the next one. No one has any idea how to make software, they think that's like making a car, it doesn't work this way.



No one can't be fired, this is a nest of incompetence.
Advice: Fire incompetent people and take some time to make some reflection about yourselves. Whatever decision you are going to take soon, doing taking this in mind, do actual people have the competence to "Drive the future of mobility"? If not... fire them. This whole situation is contraproducent for the goals of the company, this many external companies... they's no accountability, ownership for anything we do, the daily job is reduced to a game of blaming others. It's just a big hierarchical structure, where everyone is blaming and fingerpointing each other for their mistakes instead of working as a team towards a common goal, this mindset percolates even in small departments and even amongst team members, or teams.
Pros: Stability, pension, the workers council will make sure to make you stay (although this is bad, as incompetent people will always stay)

Cons: Not busy = means that it is really quite boring, and not just for my position either the sales team are equally as bored.



Where to start?

• Poor training, had no idea what was going on for the majority of my employment and therefore I didnt learn anything to help me develop any skills.

•Lack of communication between all the departments, leads to a lot of confusion

•Manager was way too passive aggressive 

•The Sales team were quite good at returning calls, however some members of the service team just dont care (I dont blame them) but the consequences are that customers get angry at le receptionist. (Which reminder, wasnt trained for)

•Diversity is probably good, the other employees had low key racist comments or discriminatory comments to certain races etc.



Additional meh things:

•The layout of the place made it very hard to see things and do my job

•Update employee areas please, the toilets were horrible, the kitchen was just grim and had very basic things, just a kettle actually

•You would think for a multi million or billion company they would provide more for the staff like lunch, better utilities, even caring and that's free

•Sick isnt paid which is just stupid 



Probably a lot more, but my experience is mine alone. I wouldn't recommend working here in the dealerships as they are quite boring, high pressure, confused management and bad work/life balance.
Advice: Be better.
Pros: Not a busy environment which is both a pro and con*

Cons: Will not be given any meaningful work or work at all. Most of the day in spent day dreaming. HR  and payroll is not transparent at all and attempts to conceal information from you. Extremely boring and worthless internship unless, you want to experience living in Japan. Almost all other interns will be people that major in  Asian Studies  with no knowledge on Business or Economics/the automotive industry. No "native" English speakers, most employees 98% of employees are either German or Japanese. So, if your Japanese is not very good, it will be a difficult experience. Toyohashi is an extremely boring part of Japan and if given the option, goto Tokyo. Although, your salary will not go very far in Tokyo. It will be 100% better than frequenting the same 3 bars that close at 11pm every weekend.
Advice: Don't needlessly hire interns. If there isn't a project or assignments for them, don't hire them.
Pros: Get to live in Japan

Respectful Colleges

Job offer likely with successful internship

No drug test

Paid(Most internships in Japan are unpaid or extremely low-paid compared)

They will find you housing if you work/live in Toyohashi.

Cons: No direction, hire and fire
Advice: None
Pros: Nice Colleagues to work with

Cons: Unfortunately i would say that the hiring policy is very strict and depends on your top managers if they heard about you. Work hard and might have a change to be rewarded, knowing that a recommendation from the top managment in Volkswagen group is worth a lot if you apoly somwhere else.
Advice: Keep up the good job and the management you are following. It not uncommon to meet the president of the company and naturally says hi to you because he trully value his employees from interns to top management.
Pros: As your managers are all seniors they are just an awesome source of knowledge and inspiration. I think the management used in Volkswagen by some managers is just brillant as they try to put you at the best of your performance. you will participate all the travels and most the car dealer network visits and these kind of things. Today I can say that I gained in maturity and changed a part of how I was working. Also the end of the months is an exciting moment to live in the automotive industry.

Cons: There are 20% old fashioned macho types which still have the old german mentality (from before 1979) which think women are below them. These discriminating bullies are still around, also destructive people from the old management culture, which brought the company to its knees, and with their attitude they destroy the team spirit and demotivate the surrounding team. When these people are managers, they are there for their own gain; they change the position a lot. Although there are also good ones who care for their employees.
Advice: Telling the press that the old culture is being changed, and making cool shows with famous people, doesn't change the fact, that the old culture is still there. Ensuring that the old-mentality managers do not get important positions would be one step ahead. It is not serious and makes no good impression to the outside world to make a top manager responsible for software engineering who has very little clue about software engineering.
Pros: Remote office work possible. Very family friendly. Most of colleagues in Germany are very good colleagues. Very strong workers' union.

Cons: You manage your career alone, and explore new opportunities under covert. The HR system doesn't work although they claim for 'best employer' program. Promotions are very rare. You are promoted from outside. From inside promotion doesn't work and you have to do lots of  politics.
Advice: Walk the talk and o objective review of career path and be honest about skills and potentials. If negative opinion on promotions then give true and objective guidance on how to improve, and make it part of the regular (quarterly( follow up. Check also with skip level meetings.
Pros: Different jobs, experiences, areas. Moving from one to another area is quite easy if you are a people person and skilled in what you do. Company has international and growing business. Opportunities may help you land on other parts of the planet if you want (and can).

Cons: POLITICS, blocking promotions based on current requirement, salary does not compare (from what I have investigated), dictation, disrespect for staff and 'those not in the circle of influence', Inability to implement / make decisions. Buddy system of staff, no consequences for failure, no recognition for success. Clocking in and out system, time sheets monitored, no freedom without permission at every turn. Regardless of how hard you work / what you do / what you have done to get there - you are all treated - and mostly paid - the same.
Advice: Set feasible KPI's, that when met should be recognised and form a base for salary / base, take the time to talk to your staff and find out what they are doing, promotions should be based on merit and what can be proven - not whims.
Pros: The car, quarterly bonus, 13th cheque, job security, uniform saves.

Cons: The company desperately wants to grow at all costs ....at all costs! The attitude is that anything is able to be overcome with money and that means all resources are funnelled into paying for discounting cars or pushing more and more equipment into them to make them appealing enough to overcome buyer resistance to issues that are surfacing about quality and reliability. Staff turnover is high in some departments due to very poor management.
Advice: Dont pretend to care about your customers or staff, actually care enough and respect that they are valuable. Selling more cars is not going to solve the problems in the brand or at the dealerships.
Pros: Really good products and people who are completely committed to the brand despite not all being well below the surface.

Good pay and conditions but terrible location.

Cons: Too much bureaucracy and controls slow down anything you have to do to cope with competition actions in the market.



Everything needs to be reported and decided in HQ in Germany. Germans don't believe in Brazilians knowledge of the market.



Excessive agreements with employee's unions does not let you dismiss bad employees, making the management even more hostage of a bad management situation than in similar companies.
Advice: You must fight the excess of meetings and implement a 360º evaluation of all management AND employees. The market is for the fast ones, not to the slow ones.



Try to dismount each department feud.



Try to not change the whole VP level every three years, because this leads the company to not face and solve long term problems.
Pros: Good bonus and new cars every year.

Cons: Bad communication from top to bottom

Management placed on a pedestal

Lack of career opportunities

Lack of career planning

Lack of responsibility for people on the floor

Lack of health and safety awareness
Advice: Volkswagen wants to implement Toyota concepts to their processes, but this can only be done once management is seen as part of the team and not placed on a pedestal. Look at Toyota's management concept. Communication needs to be improved from top to bottom and with people having more of a input in the day to day decisions.  People also need the opportunity for guidance for a career plan. Maybe spend as much time on their people as they do on their product's quality. People need to feel save and valued at work.
Pros: Good quality product

Pride in the product

Salaries are competitive

Good team spirit

Good quality equipment 

Up to date with technology

Cons: Like isolated region, top management seems arrogant for Local people, making business plans for his own career, selfishness. Connection between HQ and korea is not communicated very well, I don’t know why. We need secret inspectors to review all directors of NSC. They don’t see long term strategy but see short term plans for his personal career.
Advice: Because of your(top management) political arguments in Korea, local people are getting loose strong motivation to work and to see further actions. Hello VW HQ!! Please send us inspectors and re-check the organization. As long as I see, local people want to do for their future and everything. Please set this organization for more healthy and futuristic.
Pros: Usual benefit programs. Name value from brand power.

Cons: No true people managers, only target obsessed types with no knowledge of teams jobs, processes, or people's skills. V fast paced, overly complex processes and systems, cumbersome working practices, and the most over the top interview format for jobs that are all much of a muchness. Anyone would think they are carrying out vetting for CIA the length and gruelling nature of their interview processes - when they are generally all pretty similar admin jobs. 

Day job - expect to encounter old fashioned business processes, and expect a fierce blame culture.
Advice: Start recruiting true people mangers - with people skills.
Pros: Car ownership schemes are handy if you are without wheels.

Cons: To reach a higher positioin you must be german, mexicans and others take too long to reach a higher position because in my experience the CEO and the other chiefs are germans.They also make you work saturdays and sundays if necessary.

Career progression is difficult, it all about timing

A lot of great employees are unmotivated

Cons: Unfortunately they have a big problem with blame culture, people spend a lot of time trying to cover themselves instead of collaborate or work . The company is slightly behind compared to other large corporations, no working from home or flexibility culture. It’s up to the managers to decide how their team work.

IF your face fits you will be fine, or a woman who entertains her male "boss"
Advice: Managing Directors need to watch the management below them as they truly are running a muck!
Pros: The only positive of this coming are the benefits such as onsite physio, but they use these benefits to cover up the fact they are terrible employers.

No standards to merit employee's performance. 

Processes of appraisal are just for sake, nobody follows it. 

Management does not take care of performers.
Advice: .
Pros: Good work-life balance is maintained. 

Nice pay packages are offered. 

Nice working atmosphere. 

Employee benefits are good. 

Employee feels no burden.

Cons: 1- Incompetent management: The management skills of middle and top management are very poor. Firstly the managers do not understand how the software industry works and then do not have the inclination of learning how it works. The people management skills of most of these managers can be gauged from the fact that a four member team has seen 8 people leave(in 2 years time) because they couldn't work in the VW IS environment.





2-Management focus: The top managers hardly play any role in the success of the IT projects. Top/middle managers or project manager hardly come into picture.

One senior manager seemed to have just one role  - point out to people that "this door can't be used for exit", "you need to wear tie" "you are only working the normal working hours??"



3-work-life balance: It is a very clear message from managers that developers need to work more that the normal working hours(No, budget doesn't permit overtime). 

Their estimates are generally very very poor and people end up working on weekends.

To give you an idea of the estimates: For one project the development lead estimated 115 man days of effort however the total development effort was 500+ man days..that too when developers had to cut corners to get the minimum functionality delivered.



I don't think there was even a proper discussion on why the estimates were so wrong.



4-software development processes:

Agile?  -NO

Waterfall?- NO

adhoc? - yes

wierd? -yes

depends on the whims and fancy of managers? - NO (remember that managers do not come into picture at all)

depends on the whims and fancy of lead? - YES and NO (yes, the development process keeps changing on the whims and fancy of the lead, however as the lead has no control - developers can divert the process at will)



Does the process work? - Good question!!





5-more focus on lip service than performance: This organisation doesn't value performance. To be really valued, one needs to be close to either the lead or the manager and if so, then he can get away with murder.



6-Highly political environment: 99% of employees in this department are contractors, including lead and project manager. First focus of these people is to cover their ^**£% and think about the task in hand later.

It is a highly political environment. Good people keep leaving as they can't survive and the crappies keep accumulating.



7- Not learning from mistakes: The worst part is that the VW IS department is not learning from its mistakes. I could see the same mistakes being repeated over and over again.
Advice: Create a meritocracy

Value competence and performance

learn from your mistakes

get rid of the existing crap managers

Managers need to play a part to see success in IT projects.

Concentrate on process
Pros: Brand name is the attractive feature

Cons: Bureaucratic, too much emphasis placed on processes, although employee car ownership scheme is an exceptional benefit you aren't always guaranteed the vehicle you want yet you must still pay the same amount. Also employees on starting salaries must pay the same as Directors for their vehicles
Advice: None
Pros: Great atmosphere, amazing benefits, opportunities to move around the brands and functions, iconic brands and talented colleagues

Cons: The Mangement has no vision at all. Promotions are more based on coffee talk than performance and knowledge. You have to be "visible" was often heard. It is part of the game but if those people take the leaed it is understandable why the company falls behind in new technologies
Advice: Change your culture and allow innovation
Pros: Work-Life-Balance



35h working week and 30d vacation are very good for someone who enjoys freedom.

Good transport and food service

Cons: There are some pockets of management that do not follow company values and frankly, should not be there. Beware of the occasional snake.
Advice: Find dissenters and remove them to retain the best people.
Pros: I worked at VWG UK for nearly 5 years. Most people I came across were friendly, helpful and competent. Overall my experience of the company was a positive one. Good benefits.

Cons: Very poorly run, extremely unorganised, to few staff to do the job properly,shocking management as all they want to do is “hit with a stick” to get results and tick the VW boxes, bullying of some weaker staff is common place hence the revolving door, selling cars seems to be an after thought
Advice: Look after your staff properly and they will look after you and your company and make it a good place to work thus creating continuity with staff not wanting to leave all the time
Pros: The earning potential is quite good with a great quality VW brand

Cons: Volkswagen is a place where they try to create rules to make work efficient and fair for everyone, but the truth is these rules are only applied to certain people.



For example, there is a rule that 2 people with the same education and work experience should not be paid differently. 



There is another rule that sets payment levels (tariff groups) for people based on experience and education.



There is a third "rule" not written anywhere but enforced by HR when they find convenient that says people cannot be promoted more than 2 tariffs up.



Sounds all fair, but now, if you told HR that you were getting a salary of X which happens to be way lower than you would get at VW with the same experience and education. They will offer you less than they should, you accept, fair enough, not their fault you don't know better.



You get hired, you are already making less money than people with the same education and experience and thus there is a rule being broken. Then you ask for a raise to put yourself on the same levels of your colleagues, they say no because you can't be "promoted" many tariffs like that. But it is not a promotion as according to the tariff group that is exactly what you should be paid in the first place.



Would be great if would stop there. Let's say you have a friend in high places at Volkswagen and you don't have the education nor the experience to ask for a high salary. Still, you ask for a category (salary) that is meant for someone with at least 6 years more experience than you have. In general, HR would say no to this kind of request but as you came from internal and very important recommendation you get the salary that is not meant for you.



Now you are breaking 2 rules, where you make more money than people more experience and having a category not meant for you, just because of nepotism.



To make things even worse, Volkswagen pays way less to women than men.
Advice: Managemen at Volkswagen is the reason why the company is such much behind innovation. Old managers, with old mentality and old ways of doing business and managing.

Lack of the authentic Scandinavian culture from Sweden and not all employees have the same rights. HR sometimes 'forgets" to communicate and is ruling the office with the iron fist(Spanish way). i can't remember if I ever had an honest and objective performance review. The worst of it all is that headquarters don't care about this office and see this place as another cheap labour location.

Low salary budget, almost none trainings. To much manual work( old financial systems, procedures) for a multinational company that sells premium vehicles, 0 investments in the automation and in the people. The employees are the ones who raise the company.
Advice: Trainings for the management for developing soft skills, communication, training ( internationals) to open the mind.
Pros: The company is lucky to have, had, some employees with ethic skills, soft skills, responsible, but who doesn't know to appreciate them.

Cons: The leadership is incompetent at most levels. Managers bullies employees with the support of the HR organization. The so called "speak up culture" is in practice only allowed if it is positive. No constructive criticism of feedback is accepted. Managers support each other and distance themselves from the employees. 50% of all manager recruitments are friends according to a union survey. The manager culture is rotten to the core. Leave if you can.
Advice: The management needs to be replaced on all levels and a new sound culture needs to be nurtured from scratch and down to up. This includes the complete HR organization. Listen to the employees and the unions. Work together on a rebirth of the company and management culture or die as a company. It might be too late already to do something about it.

Cons: High bearocray like any other big company.
Advice: None
Pros: Using state or the art tools 
Ability to innovate

Cons: I had the opportunity to work for this company, and I must say that my overall experience was quite disappointing. The company is deeply rooted in old-fashioned practices and seems to operate with a work philosophy from the 80s. One of the major drawbacks is their claim of striving to become a software company, yet the reality is quite different. The management's approach to people and work resembles something from the 80s, lacking modern flexibility and innovation. Salary adjustments are incredibly rare, and there is a prevalent culture of micro-management, which creates an extremely toxic environment. For any software engineer in the market, I strongly advise against considering this company. The lack of flexibility, slow adaptation to new technologies, and toxic work environment make it an unfavorable choice. If you value a modern work culture that encourages growth and innovation, this company is definitely not the place for you.

Cons: Uncertainty, Spa2 delay, layoffs, unplanned hiring
Advice: Plan the future
Pros: Work-life balance, company cars, vacations, office lication

Cons: The engineering managers for the Data Engineering teams make this place horrible to work at. They skip or ignore feedback in the tech interviews to make sure their friends get in. They are also actively working against each other and one manager has even been told they’re not allowed to speak to their subordinate manager because they can’t behave or treat them with respect.

Cons: It's been a good number of years since Volvo Cars started its agile transformation.



Until now, the company has little trust in the reliability of the individuals filling agile roles (RTE, PM, SM, PO).



The line management is a complete pain in the head.



If you go around in the corridors of Volvo Cars, and pick any random PO/SM and ask them their take on the line management, they would tell you "I hate them, they are horrible".



In the new organization structure at Volvo Cars, the number of layers of line management was reduced. It's high time to terminate the line management organization in its entirety and transfer its responsibilities (and they're trifling for what matters) to the agile roles in the organization.



The current line management may assume agile roles. If they don't want it, they have the door, they can go back to the Ericsson they have already ruined!

Other companies in EU will generally compensate much more ( more than a 100% from experience ).

- Executives have been there for more than 15 to 20 years. Says a lot about what is hindering growth in the company.
- Employees at Stockholm office are NEGLECTED on all levels. [From benefits to office space / location]
- Not diverse at all. [Just go take a look at the executive team.
- New blood held back due to bureaucracy.

Design reorg a year ago doesn't address the root of the problem. Lots of churn in the company, especially in the stockholm office, resulting in the need to ramp up hiring in other Swedish cities or lure people to move.
Advice: Buckle up for a rough ride. We are too slow. Empower the new hires to build great digital products rather than hinder them with the old, otherwise you risk losing more talent.

Start to think and act more like a global company instead of thinking within your own confines of Torslanda. 

Promote more women and POCs. Have a clearer plan for ICs to progress their career.
Pros: - Amazing colleagues.
- Good benefits for being a Swedish company.

Cons: Slow and lengthy process for decision making.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company with amazing people. Open and transperent corporate culture.

Cons: - Big organization with some slow processes and in the middle of a reorg at the moment.

- The company is "Gothenburg-heavy", most of the decisions are made there, and the Stockholm office lacks some perks they have in Gothenburg (on-site restaurants, gym facilities, etc.)

- Stockholm office is too sterile (plain white walls, grey floor carpet, no decoration, no colors).

- I miss some perks I had at my previous employers (tech education budget for courses and conferences, massage in the office, language course, gym membership, top-notch computer and phone, fika, Friday beer, hack days, meetups, swag, etc.)
Advice: The digital transformation is a good step, but maybe try to make the company and the office a bit more "trendy" so you don't have to solely rely on high salary offers when it comes to attracting young talents.
Pros: - Good office location in downtown Stockholm; free fruits, coffee and soda; playing room.

- Decent work equipment (Macbook Pro and iPhone, but not the newest models like at other companies ).

- Nice, talented coworkers, international environment.

- Meaningful product, interesting project (mine at least is).

- Really good salary (Volvo Cars is able and willing to pay the price of the best talent, they seduce people from top Swedish tech companies like Spotify, Klarna, King, iZettle).

- Perks (pension contribution, annual bonus, discount on cars, etc.)

Cons: Management need to show vision
slow changes

Cons: Some managers are less good
Advice: None
Pros: Talented cooworkers

Good atmosphere

Good opportunities within the company

Cons: Stressfull, overtime every week, criminal people in the management and lots of substance abuse. Horrible culture and place to be.
Advice: Clean up in the organization and make it legit.
Pros: Good salary but that probably the only thing worth mentioning about this company

Cons: The company is very conservative, which slows its innovation and market share growth.  Because employee retention is so high, there is limited opportunity to grow into new positions, and they are the slowest I've ever experienced with regard to static promotions (eg moving someone from an engineer to senior engineer, which doesn't require a vacated position).  The salaries are also very low compared to similar positions in automotive companies located outside of Sweden.
Advice: None
Pros: The work environment is relaxed and positive, and one of their greatest strengths is their employee retention.  With so many people that have been working together for so long, the company works well together in many ways.  The company has many ways in which it is employee centric and offers a lot of possibility to move around within the organization.  Current changes in corporate structure may improve cross-functional work and information exchange, but it remains to be seen as it's a work in progress.  The benefits are good and the management is flexible to the life interests and demands outside of work.

Cons: It is not clear what career path you can have when you join the company. Currently there is a lot of encouragement towards horizontal moves of people, cross-functionally. The Swedish mindset and culture brings positives, such as a flat organization and democracy, and a great work-life balance, but it also generates a laid back working culture, with very few ambitious people willing to walk the extra mile.
Advice: None
Pros: The designed around you culture means there is a lot of focus on people development and the leadership practices are oriented towards positive and constructive feedback, encouraging employees to have initiative and be proactive. The industry as such is very dynamic and rapidly changing, and working for Volvo which is a quite small player compared to BMW or Mercedes, means more exposure to the industry, different departments and projects.

Cons: 1. Culture discourages working from home

2. Hard to increase salary while under contract. 

3. Architects have way too much control over the day to day work and implementations of the software developers.

4. Overtime requests are quite common (once to twice a year).

5. Not much fun or perks at the office

6. Office space and area (Torslanda) is boring and too far from the city
Advice: More autonomy to software engineers.

more perks in the office. (breakfast, snacks, music...etc.)

More software engineers closer to the city to be in par with other software companies
Pros: 1. Everything shifting to Agile and therefore things are moving a lot faster

Teams are having more and more autonomy to build products

2. You manage your own time.

3. Easy to change jobs within the company.

4. Management encourages to build competence (pays for courses, books and provides rewards for passing courses)

Cons: Old school leadership way too common, generally poor senior management behaviors and narcissist CEO not fitting a transformation to tech. Confuses culture for campus feel and ping pong tables.  Needs to hire people for virtual teams to meet skills gap but focus on office presence simultaneously. Younger and lower level leadership much more promising but need to act like bumpers currently. Deep but not broad specialists - sub optimization of almost everything main rule.
Advice: Address your own and others behaviors, stop trying to control yourself to success. Embrace the needed software culture, dare to let go of control and act like know-it-all’s  and stop behaving like power hungry VPs from the 90s. Embarrassing.
Pros: Good intent culture. People approachable and kind. Wants to modernize and transform itself and succeeds in parts. Decent pay since HR stopped interfering. Actually do have a unique position as a (comparatively) fast mover into mobility in premium segment. Strong brand.

Cons: Compensation for software developers is way less than in any German OEM, even not talking about Tesla or any other US-based company. Benefits program is also incredibly poor: it is super cool to buy a new Volvo with a 15% discount but it is still not affordable for a person who is working as a software developer without a loan for 5-7 years.
Advice: If you would like to be like Tesla for a software engineer, you must be as attractive as Tesla. Otherwise really good engineers will never prioritize Volvo's offer over Tesla's offer. Right now Tesla is a way ahead of you.

Meanwhile, for manufacturer workers the situation is completely opposite, it think you're better than Tesla.
Pros: Company is investing a lot of money in an attempt to beat Tesla. Volvo Cars is really trying to change from being a pure vehicle manufacturer to the software oriented OEM brand.

Cons: - The full-time employees had to work too much, and it didn't seem to be temporary. 

- So much meetings nobody had time to do their work. Both these things gives a hint of a malfunctioning work environment.

- Poor salary, considering one year to M.Sc. and doing relevant tasks. The salary among the full-time employees where not especially competitive either.
Advice: None
Pros: - Very good colleagues and closest manager were great. The were welcoming and supportive.

- Interesting tasks that was needed to be done and not just something stupid you because the summer intern have to do something.

- Good insight in work life and a good experience for the future.

- Good career opportunities as the contacts that were made there could be used for M.Sc. thesis opportunities and a first job after graduation.

Cons: Auto industry is experiencing a disruption and Volvo Cars is not fully ready for it. Currently working at the autonomous driving department, which means major part of the job is securing the delivery from the suppliers (integration/testing/analysis) to guarantee the car safety, but not much of real technical development. There is a lack of personal competence development as an engineer. Obscure future about the merge with Geely Auto.
Advice: Vertical integration with suppliers, further remove the workforce redundancies / duplicate functions within the company or subsidiary companies.
Pros: Care and respect for people. Nice and competitive colleagues to work with. Good sales number so far until Oct 2020, so the business runs well.

Cons: It is never enough, if you work hard, they want you to work harder 

Volvo gent should be more important than your private life 

Bad communication 

Work pressure to high 

Pretend to be a good employer  but only cares about making cars and profit 

Benefits of the company are only adapted for the people Who are making the rules instead of those Who are making the cars
Advice: Have more respect for the People Who work for the company
Pros: Good salary, good payment 

Company car program

A lot of benefits such as bonus and insurances 

Company restaurant with cheap food 

Nice cars

Cons: If you are a serious software developer, please keep away from VolvoCars. This is a quite traditional company. Most managers did not have a strong background in the software area, even in sometime, they refuse to do the change as a software company. 

Lots of people only have the ability to talk, open the meeting, As a developer, please keep away from this company.



By the way, this is the first company what I have meet, the ScM was a dedicated role, whose jobs is talk, talk, talk.......
Advice: Please try to learn some knowledge of software engineer. give respect to the software engineer instead of dedicated ScM.
Pros: work/life balance. work/life balance.work/life balance.work/life balance.work/life balance.

Cons: A lot of change of organisation and roles going on. Still some traditional OEM culture going on with people resisting change and challenge of the business models.
Advice: Dare to challenge old models and try the new. Give people a chance to grow into roles, hire people with right mindset and train on the job. Hire managers who can manage people not only the project.
Pros: Great work life balance. Development opportunities within company to try out new things. Great people and culture. A lot of growth and forward spirit. Good benefits.

Cons: - No governance on employee performance

- Promotions are 100% subjective

- Outdated digital infrastructure 

- Average age is high thus the mindset and culture are very old

- HQ is almost 90% Swedes, major steps needed for international diversity

- Regions are highly disconnected from HQ

- Workplace is very bland and boring,  feels like 1990s

- Extremely slow decision making
Advice: - Hire more internationals

- Hire younger people

- Govern employee performance

- Understand the importance of data and digital infrastructure
Pros: - Growing and recognized brand

- Decent product portfolio

- Tons of development opportunities

Cons: Totally toxic culture in Australia NSC.  HQ actively promotes a whisteblower program, which enables disgruntled employees &amp; dealers to tell outrageous lies about good employees. Targeted employees axed on basis of biased police style investigations, and without opportunity to answer accusations. 

Structure of bonus program actively favors head office senior management  and discriminates against local team.
Advice: Get real about ethics and culture. Build a realistic  culture based on people. Time serving seat warmers have too much say.  Targets are realistic, but budgets &amp; resources aren't consistent. Allow  a more stable plan to achieve growth targets
Pros: Fantastic Product, ambitious plans, some good colleagues (outside the clique). Roomy offices, good furniture. Company car policy very reasonable. Gender equal pay structures

Cons: A traditional automotive company trying to become a Tech company. People working in tech should expect a long and bumpy road during this journey to Agile ways of working across the entire organisation in making lightning fast decisions and shifting quickly with the trends.
Advice: None
Pros: Equal opportunity employer. Rich history and prestige  building the world's safest cars. Starting an exciting new phase into making only electrified vehicles from 2021.

Cons: It’s management only looks flat, the old established systems are not possible to change even if they are proven wrong, for non-Swedish it is more difficult to get promotions, innovation is less focused upon, the management and the unions would rarely intervene if there is a problem leaving the employee vulnerable to toxic conditions.
Advice: None
Pros: It is almost what you expect from a corporation: good benefits, international community, lots of projects to work with and etc

Cons: Because of the set up of the program, you rotate to a new role every 4-6 months and therefore you feel as the ‘new person’ a lot. It’s not really a con, just something that might be challenging for some.
Advice: None
Pros: The graduate program is a great way to learn about different parts of the company, to become really confident in the business as well as comfortable with uncertainty.

Cons: Old company with strong traditions, some people might be resistant to change
Advice: Regarding the current transformation I think an entrepreneurial approach to validating the new business models is essential to success
Pros: Great resources for self-improvement

Great culture (engagement, openness, diversity, ethics)

Interesting transformation of the company. Volvo is in a nice place right now with a focus on mobility services, electrification and autonomous drive.

Cons: There is a risk that the processes becomes too bureaucratic due to Volvos size. Too much administation reduces creative time for the engineers.
Advice: Continue on the path towards more efficient and environmental products packed with innovative solutions that make the customers lives better.
Pros: Innovative and caring corporation with great products. Volvo is well equiped to handle the changing environment and new customer demands. A lot of creative persons.

Cons: Not yet a global company. Still most employees work in either China or Sweden. Needs to work on more female leaders and a better international balance of management.
Advice: Don't forget to give credit to those who work with great loyalty to construct and produce these beautiful cars.
Pros: A Company in ramp-up phase with a lot of exiting products ahead. Building up capabilities for autonomous drive and e-commerce.

Cons: Since the culture is not very aggressive, the development is slow too except the market in China. Global strategy is very centralized in Sweden HQ, and there is less communication between different country markets.
Advice: None
Pros: Work-life balance, never overload, very Swedish. The culture is very much to "avoid conflicts" and is not very performance driven - very easy to survive in such environment.

Cons: Multinational typical bureaucratic procedures.

Swedish attitude rether slower response than some german competitors
Advice: The latest decisions and policy definition is the right track.

The fast growing / quick development of Volvo Cars, which already started, is the final proof that current strategy is right. Should continue that way.
Pros: Extremely dynamic industry.

Position of the company very Person Oriented.

Extreme care with Customer Satisfaction.

Swedish attitude. (Relaxed, flexible and target oriented).

Cons: Sometimes things move very slow.  You may feel the disconnect with end goal or mission of the company.
Advice: There is more room to improve on making employees feel involved in the end mission of the company .
Pros: Amazing flexibility in the work environment allows you to have a good work life balance.  Also the work challenges are quite fulfilling  for an engineer.

Cons: To slow moving company. Many different areas of development and it is slowing the machinery down. It needs to review its dev processes and let management get much more hands on until processes and flows move swiftly.
Advice: Needs to start managing the companies software pipe to several 100% better. There is no direction no operational hands-on to get things in place.
Pros: Company cars, new frontline technology

Cons: Completely hopeless senior Swedish leadership team. Still reaping the benefits of Stefan Jacoby's past decisions and vision. No new ones of any substance since he unfortunately went.
Advice: There are other countries & cultures outside of Sweden. Stick to design & let the markets sell the product.
Pros: Good people trying to do the best thing locally

Cons: Some departments are manage by incompetents with wishful thinking and no connection/experience to the real world  - too much small politics instead of focus in work when that happens
Advice: Get real and stop applying fairy tale management theories - Agile. Everybody knows that doesn't work, except you that should be the first to know!
Pros: Big company, many departments, many possibilities.

Cons: As a technician you have to pre call customers, diagnose the car (obviously), price up the parts, check the stock, call customer to get authority, order parts then carry out repair. Feels like you have to do everyone's job. 
Lots of waiting appointments which aren't properly organised.
Advice: None
Pros: Nice people to work with
Great product
Lots of training courses to progress

Cons: Nothing that I can think of.
Advice: None
Pros: Volvo Cars has a good company culture which makes you enjoy working in the company.

It feels good to be part of a company with nice products which brings customer safety on top of all the decisions. as a SW Engineer, working Agile is also a highlight of working in an automotive company.

Cons: Hard to say, but being a relatively small player in the automotive industry does face certain challenges.
Advice: Not to get too confident with the current success run, sometimes revolution comes in the form of quick evolutionary steps.
Pros: Great culture, good w-l-balance, positive momentum! Absolutely a place I would recommend to a close friend looking for work.

Cons: They are so good at talking, but you will get nothing at the end

Management avoid writing, they do things in a meeting, so you can never has anything to prove!

Management gets it all wrong and it is so easy for them to get on with it, as they get promoted, and someone else to clean their mess.
Advice: You need 21st century mentality and way of working, get down from your ivory tower.
Pros: Nothing really, unless you like developing a product while talking by the coffee machine!

Cons: It is a large organisation, sometimes you can feel that

Most office spaces are very good, but in some buildings still lacking a bit
