manager be continually demean to employee , use gaslighte tactic to try and squeeze anything extra from people eager to prove themselves and move up in a company most of we be excited and hopeful to work for .

<PERSON> :
while in some company trainees_management trainee have their own project , a lot of department where you get your rotation treat you as a free labor to do the most boring work .
many manager do not understand that you be pay twice as much as a basic intern , and it would be more useful for the company and the trainee to give more interesting project with some responsibility .
so my advice be to ask upfront for a specific project ( as it will help you gain experience_management experience_management ) , and avoid routine work which people just try to get rid of ( it do not teach you anything and do not bring any value ) or try to share it , otherwise your motivation will dissapear very soon . 


it seem also that headcount in some department be not right at all - some people work till <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> very often , while other always leave at <TIME> <TIME> ( not because they be more efficient ) 

advice : develop a specific program for each trainee with project they can be solely responsible for .

 they never think you will leave 

 some senior manager will not even recognise junior people 's exsistence 


the ceo think this therefore you think this 
 advice : look for the young bright spark and promote they accordingly not purely on time accrue  

 take on consultants_management consultant , they be expensive but they will make you more efficient 

 all country do not operate the same , a product may work in <CARDINAL> place and not in another , local staff need to be able to speak up

 lack of process and an air of confusion about who be responsible for what which be disguise as flexibility and Graduate_creativity 

 Graduate_creativity and recruitment_intern recruitment_intern be huge which sometimes give an overriding feeling of immaturity and lack of experience . 


Pay be much low than market average 
 advice : increase headcount_Increase and give people the opportunity to excel at what
  they do .
currently , people be too busy try to cram in the basic to reveal their true flair . 


Invest in system that work and spend money on make they appropriate for the business .
currently , a process_business process_business that work be be alter and adapt to suit the system .

 advice : stop rest on your laurel , good product alone be not go to keep <ORG> alive - not only be you lose good talent but will find it difficult to attract and retain good talent if you do not look inward at what you could and should fix within the business .
also need to look at the levels_knowledge level o

Most of sale do a <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> as a minimum and this be only get long ( I usually start at <DATE> and finish at <TIME> <TIME> ) , mean I be too tired <DATE> <DATE> to socialise and switch off .
sale contract be <TIME> <TIME> per week ... 

 - Management be very slow to make decision and often seem to be look out for themselves by want a large amount of information .
this can mean that we annoy the retailer and miss opportunity 

 - more concerned with share_market share_market than Low_profit 

 - low pay for the share_market ( <MONEY> <MONEY> <MONEY> <MONEY> <MONEY> <MONEY> less compare to our competitor ) , no overtime or day in lieu for <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> 

 - little collaborative approach to issue or problem .
those in sale be expect to come up with the answer individually and then present to management , but then of course they be slow to act

different story with management though , I hear they invest in their manager .

maybe than your rate_turnover rate_turnover will not be astronomically high !
you be loose money retrain new hire all the time anyway ! 

 b ) pay new grad a decent salary , I know they be easily replaceable , but they be also the backbone of your organization , so invest in your non - management employee .

when they decide to merge our brand together , it come with new management , who be complete bully .

within <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> , I be tell I have no talent , that I be never a artist_makeup artist_makeup , and would only benefit from small , unknown brand outside of l'oreal .
the way the company treat staff who be not management be disgusting .

Most of the manager be really young and do not have a clue about manage . 


if there be a department where every employee be work <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> for <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> , it mean that they be understaffed !
no need to wait <DATE> <DATE> to get to this conclusion ! 


make the process_decision process_decision fast .

no real over your career as they have a path for you and even if you may voice a certain interest in a certain position they will not grant it to you if they have another idea for you .
there be no fairness in how position be grant . 

advice : the arrogance of <ORG> <ORG> on how they take control of someone 's career or think what be good for you need to change if they want to keep good people with competency .

but if thing would go bad , you be to blame    example : especially in <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> in your <ORDINAL> job ever , you should be able to ask some question as you be like an alien .
in my case , it be not allow to ask " how " question .
you could only suggest a possible set of solution to your manager and he would choose the direction for you .
how you be suppose to get to those option be a mystery .
you can ask around of course but nobody would have time for you . 




<ORG> , unwelcome culture .

Bonus be meager , unless you be senior mgmt . 
 advice : they have to value their employee more .
I see too many good people get poach from competitor , which mean that the company be not be compensate / recognize very well .
it do not make sense to develop an employee for <DATE> <DATE> and then lose they to a competitor for nothing but a small promotion or $ <MONEY> k raise_K ( I mean , that be practically nothing to the company in <DATE> term ) . 

pro : global company ( you can transfer to other location / country ) .

<PERSON> : lack of clarity over opportunities_career opportunity for <LOC> at the end of the program , stem from an inability to confront the reality of the situation ( too many graduate , too few operational role ) .
responsibility and amount of engage ( as oppose to menial ) work vary too much from role to role on the scheme_graduate scheme_graduate , with some role similar to operational role and other too heavily admin base . 

advice : Re - consider the role of the scheme_graduate scheme_graduate ( cheap labour or future development_leadership development_leadership ) and adapt the balance between entry level full - roles_time role and scheme_graduate accordingly .
More formal organisation of scheme_graduate scheme_graduate such that it be ensure all trainees_management trainee have serious responsibility and engage work across all role . 

<PERSON> : relatively good benefit .

pro : - opportunities_Lotsa opportunity whether you wanna move up or across the brand 

  - friendly and helpful colleague 

  - ton of training and benefit available ( if you be free enough to enjoy they , it be there ! ) 


con : Resource_Human Resource_Human support_Resource for expat in <GPE> office_Tokyo lack professionalism , mainly in visibility_salary visibility_salary and administrative support_Resource .
the system_tax system_tax be complicated and there be no system_tax briefing_tax , so you will only know your net income by the end of your expatriation .
in my case , a large unanticipated sum ( <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> JPY ) be deduct from my final pay .
when I request for clarification , it take they <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> to reply . 

advice : improve orientation for new expatriate and standardise the structure for packages_expat package around the zone .
since the system_tax system_tax in <GPE> be more complicated , discuss the package in <ORG> income_NET instead of <ORG> .
this will ease the unnecessary stress for expat and give much more visibility where finance be concern .

<PERSON> : good benefits_staff benefit of benefits_staff shop_staff and friend and sale_family sale_family and get to be a part of exciting opportunity

Long_Super long work hour and operational mess that you be continuously clear .
it can get very tiring 
 advice : the focus be always on the side_marketing side_marketing .
need to focus on other function and empower they to build a more balanced place_work place_work 
 pro : it be an open culture with a flat hierarchy .
the company be very agile you be allow to trial new thing and even if it fail the <ORG> support you and give you a feedback .
there be no fixed process hence you can bring about any kind of change .
if you be an asset and a performer you be expose to the leadership_TOP leadership_TOP .
also they tend to load everything to the person who do most the work that to I be an opportunity to learn so much 

 <PERSON> :
above everything else , <ORG> be exceptional at sale - sell the product to customer , sell " opportunity " to new employee , and especially sell a certain type of delusion to everyone who work there . 




here be the main difficulty I face while work at <ORG> : 



 -3 out of <CARDINAL> senior and mid managers_- level manager be generally unequipped for the scope_role 



 this mean a lack of understanding of what it mean to manage in a professional sense ( set objective , define scope_role scope_role and responsibility , remove roadblock , etc ) , but what be more concern , be that a lot of management be unequipped for the scope_role emotionally managers_- with no ability to empathize or understand the need of the subordinate , they be follow only because the employee have to follow they . 




-Ego <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> ; Merit + result 



 I vividly recall my manager obsess over the most insignificant detail on a deck_powerpoint deck_powerpoint , only to ensure that when he or she present it to upper management , she be see as a " superstar " .
I also recall manipulate the datum to make a fail launch look " good " , just so my manager could have good news to share .
there be a general preference for ignore data - drive decision in favour of whatever make the manager in question look good . 




-emotional abuse 



 it be a regular occurrence to see co - worker cry_workers .
it be even more commonplace to have a vacant role on any give team because the employee be on " sick leave_stress " aka " leave_stress - leave_stress " aka " burn - out " .
the scary part be that no one be bother by either of the above because they happen so frequently . 




-Hardcore cool - culture_aid culture_aid 



 there be a strong expectation that everyone who work at <ORG> must absolutely love it all the time , never mention anything negative , and <ORG> show intention of stay at the company until retirement .
if you as much as mention that you might have an interest in perhaps explore another industry or company way down the line , you will be tell to keep quiet as it will damage your progression_career progression_career .
the ironic part be that <ORG> <ORG> have by far the high rate_turnover rate_turnover in the industry , and force employee to always pretend to be " love the experience " only make it more difficult to get to the cause_root cause_root of the problem . 




-Lack of ethical backbone 



 I can not disclose any detail relate to development_product development_product for legal reason , but there be a lot of very questionable development_product both from an efficacy point_stand - point_stand as well as from the positioning_consumer positioning_consumer standpoint_positioning . 

advice : without sound like a break please_record - please_record take off your <ORG> - tint glass and assess the state of the company objectively .

the rate_turnover rate_turnover be very high to begin with , and people work until <TIME> <TIME> be not unusual . 




they talk openly about ethic and diversity but they do not practice what they preach .
it be all just for show to attract young talent .
they mostly hire straight out of college because they be inexperienced with how toxic environments_work environment be and they usually put up with it . 




I be push by a senior manager and hr to work the <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> day without complaint .
I try to explain many time that it be detrimental to my mental health and my relationship at home but they defend the " culture_L'Oreal culture_L'Oreal " and say it have to do with the " competence " they want to see if I ever want to get a promotion .
I remember feel sad and depressed but they reprimand I for not be grateful to be work there .
as a disciplinary measure they extend my period_probation period_probation and I be not eligible for a increase_salary increase_salary since then . 




when a coworker find I cry in the bathroom she say " do not worry , I have see so many people cry here at l'oreal " .
we even have a term for it at the office : " <WORK_OF_ART> <WORK_OF_ART> " .

 the salary_fix in <GPE> be base on a package with a salary_fix salary_fix and a very important " intéressement+participation " ( <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> of salary_fix per year free of charge ) .
the problem be that the fix be in general lower than in other company .

 pro : you build your own carrier at <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> be still new field to explore 

 this be a challenging world that can build a person and his carrier

<PERSON> : Concentrated in Hair and <PERSON> category .

 lack of strong middle leadership_management leadership_management

 <PERSON> : I have be work in <ORG> <ORG> for <DATE> <DATE> . 


working environment_Working be fun and people be great to work with ! 


definitely not a gossipy environment as some claim . 


<ORG> <ORG> be there if you ask for it 

 will listen to employee ' opinion and improve welfare to enhance life_work - life_work Cons_balance 

 <PERSON> :
this be a <NORP> company that operate as the <NORP> do .  
it be very political , and hierarchical , and you do have to learn the politic to get ahead .  
they always say you have to manage your own career at <ORG> , and it be true .  
you have to know what you want and learn exactly the right way to push , and who to become friend with - not everything be merit base .  
and god forbid you ever show a bit of emotion - the culture_masculine culture_masculine of <ORG> manufacturing_L'Oreal may come as a bit of a surprise , consider it be a cosmetic company_cosmetics .  
there be no woman past a certain level , so be aware that you can move forward quickly at the beginning , but you will probably have to get out after <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> if you really want to move ahead . 




the downside of quick responsibility be tha
t they give you little - to - no training - it be all " on the job " training , but this be the <ORG> way_L'Oreal , and we have all come to accept it , even if we do not like it . 




finally , the " leadership " ability of much of the management leave much to be desire .  
the top guy be between good and great , but there be a lot of people under they who do not really know how to manage ... and I do not think <ORG> have do a good job in correct that yet . 

advice : worry about the fact that even though <ORG> be vote one of the top spot to start a career , it be consistantly not rank above the top company to work for .  
<PERSON> people be willing to work hard and produce really good work , but when they see their peer , or their predecessor do the same and still not getting reward just because they do not play the game exactly right , this be a problem .  
at some point " experience " do not count as a part of compensation .  
finally , you hire smart people , but you do not trust they to do smart thing . 

pro : Young , dynamic co - worker make it easy to have a social life , especially if you have move from elsewhere .  
there be something special about work for a company whose product you see on the shelf at the salon or in <GPE> or even the up_make - up_make counter_up at <ORG> 's .  
they do give you a lot of responsability right off the bat , and if you continue to perform , you can move ahead , as long as you learn your way through the politic .  
finally , as long as you be perform well ( average , even ) , your job be not at L'Oreal_stake - L'Oreal_stake hold onto its employee sometimes well after their date_expiration date_expiration , but this also give you the chance to make mistake and take risk without ruin your future .  
if you do not fit in <CARDINAL> position , they will try you out in another , because when they hire you , somewhere they see a spark of something that they want to see shine . 


<PERSON> : - very bureaucratic environment 

 - poor management significantly impact morale_team morale_team 

 - lack of upward mobility if you be unwilling to move to <GPE> 

 - communication between head Value_office and teams_field morale_team be problematic ; feedback from teams_field morale_team be rarely lead to improvement in strategy 

 - they do not invest in the professional development of their employee 
 advice : - listen to your sale rep give that you emphasize the importance of gather intelligence_market intelligence_market that be communicate to head Value_office 

 - value your employee and take reasonable source of dissatisfaction_job dissatisfaction_job as opportunity to improve your organization and reduce Pros_turnover 
 pro : - significant level of autonomy 

 - flexible schedule 

 - Plenty of opportunity to be entrepreneurial in your Cons_territory 

 <PERSON> : all about network far more than performance , very competitive .
young leadership that need to be shappe .
poor hr management_HR with lack of undertsande what leadership trully mean ( despite the country ) 

advice : please hr , be care to your employee .
understand who your public be and enable they for what they can acutally become .
do not hinder people 's growth due to your frustration .
leader ... be mature before you aim to grow in your career , your knowhow and expertise have to match your emotional maturity , after all your <ORDINAL> product be the peple you work with ! 

pro : you will be very autonomy to create new procedure , millenial workstyle_millenials , awesome brand to work with

pro : no code_dress code_dress . 


open policy_door policy_door . 


<PERSON> :
since there be some many interlocutor and speaker , it sometimes become hard to be quick and flexible to launch campaign to the market .
also , it be a highly competitive environment with lot of business - relate pressure , and it become quite hard to keep a work / balance_life balance_life . 

advice : need to simplify processes_work process : less meeting , more <NORP> feedback , more analysis of result 
 <PERSON> : your manager trust you from the very <ORDINAL> moment you start processes_work at the company .
you be entitle and responsible for your position and can easily get visibility to top levels_management level .
it be easy to learn from cross - functional team and , if you perform correctly , you be give the chance to grow in the company . 


con : high turnover and constant change of management in the company .  
it get tire have to re - establish relationship with new manager , in <DATE> <DATE> you can have <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> different manager .  
all the hard work you do to prove yourself with your previous manager can be waste .  
because here , it do not matter what you do <DATE> <DATE> , what be you do <TIME> <TIME> ? 



 long hour .  
if there be an international visit be prepared to work weekend and late evening .  
sometimes these visit be a surprise and they tell you to prepare in <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> ( mostly rare ) .  
you end up prepare <CARDINAL> different ppt .
slide , <CARDINAL> of which might actually be use .  
the entire process_visit process_visit be such a waste of time , you be basically put on a big show for the big international boss .  
I have not hear bad thing about they , I have typically hear that they be pretty friendly , but it be just a waste of time .  
everyone be stress out and run around like chicken with their head cut off .   




Politics_Office Politics_Office .  
this be soo huge here .  
like the comment above , its all about put on a show .  
make it seem like you be do so much work and its amazing .  
everything be control by HR , and they be watch / analyze you be every move .
it be all about if they like you , performance have less to do than you would expect .  
lot of backstabbe .  
but at first its so hidden , you do not realize anything once you have the rosy shade on from be so excited to get hire .  
then slowly you see case where upper management suddenly vanish from the company .  
People will throw you under the bus to get ahead .  
poor system_value system_value .  
do not trust anyone !  
everyone be look out for themselves .  




<ORG> and IT suck here .  
you would think that a company that be so cut edge in innovation , they would invest more in their logistic management_logistics system and operation .  
especially be a <ORG> giant_CPG .  
expect computer from <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> ( kid .
but seriously : crappy it ) .  
it slow down your work , frustrating .  




poor management ( sometimes ):   if you have a bad manager , all I say be good LUCK !
you can be the hard working , most intelligent employee and if they do not like you , you be screw .  
if your manager do not know what they be do , good LUCK !
this typical do not happen , but it do ( I guess this be a risk at all company )  
but do not dare voice your opinion to hr , because their motto be " too bad , its your responsibility to deal with it " 
 advice : Relax , it be just a stick of lipstick .  
you be not cure cancer . 

pro : discount product

<PERSON> : difficult to have a working and private life balance , difficult to get support when you face difficulty with your manager_line manager_line , difficult to evolve if you do not know the good person ( lack of transparency in the management_career management_career sometimes ) 
 advice : take the principle of manage with generosity as a value that have to guide your business_day to business_day business_day .
make managers_line manager accountable for the way they manage their team in stead of take only into account the quantifiable objective set . 

pro : multinational company that have a lot of mean to develop its staff , compensation and benefit , multiplicity of paths_career path , Cons_autonomy 

 con : complete and utter disorganisation , hide by ' be entrepreneurial ' .
<ORG> do what you want , and if it work , pat on the back , but if it do not , I would have some stitch ready to patch up the wound_knife wound_knife lodge in your back ( metaphorically speak ) . 




I can see the company be try to make it a nice environment for their staff , such as implement agile working hour ( something that have be in the industry for <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> already in other company ) , but it just do not work . 


People at the top of <ORG> be far too stubborn , old school , and do not believe in change .
therefore , if you dare work from home , which be the new policy , I would not bank on get a promotion anytime soon . 


in my opinion , the only way
  <ORG> be go to become a top place to work be if they get a good old sweeping brush , and have a good clean out of old management at the top , to then bring in fresh thinker who be not brainwash by the old school <NORP> house_power house_power that rule the roost . 

advice : go on an course_training course_training at a company_FMCG like <ORG> or another top place to work company_FMCG company_FMCG ( check the time top place to work for inspiration ) , take all the learning you can from what they do , and then implement it at <ORG> . 


sound easy say than do , but there be no other business in the industry that have a high staff turn over than <ORG> . 


they must be do something right , and <ORG> must be do something wrong . 

<FAC> <FAC> <FAC> experience_business experience_business due to a lot of responsibility .
you be basically put under that much pressure that you be force to learn at a rapid pace .
great if you want to go on the apprentice . 


People be brilliant though , and you can have a great laugh . 


<PERSON> : where to begin ...
the team be extremely low on headcount , to the point where flexible / working_home working_home have to be bring in <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> and this have be readily jump to try and escape <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> ( which be and still be the norm ) .
I have have colleague who have constructively complain about the work hour effectively manage out of the company for be " inefficient " .
everyone know what be happen so it just mean that people stop complain about the workload .
unfortunately the one 's manage out for inefficiency ( not I ) tend to be the ' nice guy / girl ' . 




the work environment be very cut throat .
individual team_cross seem to work well but team_cross team_cross work be difficult as everyone be try to come up with the good idea ( and then take the credit ) .
nam , snam etc not only have to do their own job but be also organise into ' teams_brand team ' , which be essentially roles_trade roles_marketing role .
this be all extra work on top of your job_day job_day ( whether you look after <ORG> or <GPE> it be the same ) .
write presentation on the way to meetings_customer meeting be normal because you just could not find the time due to all the internal priority .
these ' teams_brand team ' go some way to explain <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> everyone do <DATE> <DATE> that be unpaid .  




talk of pay , it be low for the industry .
nam start somewhere around the late £ 30 be to mid £ <MONEY> 's , and snam be in the early £ 40 's to low £ <MONEY> 's sort of range .
when you add in the long work hour , which mean on average you be earn somewhere around the £ <MONEY> - £ 16 per hour range as a <ORG> , you have to question whether your life and investment in your education have be worth it for that , particularly be base in <GPE> . 




the final thing I will add be that when I decide to leave and be interview I have to defend the fact that I have work at <ORG> to <CARDINAL> different company that I interview with , which be surprising .
l'oreal worker be see as arrogant by the wide fmcg cultures_company and I find myself have to say in interview that I be not the typical <ORG> employee_L'Oreal in order to show that I would fit in with their cultures_company culture . 

advice : try to give your sale team more choice in what they do in term of commercial planning - have a junior manager_product manager_product tell a <ORG> or Controller_Business <PERSON> what to do in this field will only ever lead to conflict . 




remember that you be employ a young team who do actually want to experience <GPE> life_London during <DATE> <DATE> . 




think retention !
the rate_churn rate_churn at <ORG> be ridiculous and it feel like people be leave every other week .

- manager be all smart and great individual contributor , but I think too young or still need maturity in manage direct report .
those be different yet equally important sets_skill set .

 <PERSON> :
to corporate / hierarchical and to structure .
entrepreneurship be not stimulate enough .
Most people be really young within <ORG> .
company need more diversity : more old people / more man / more people from a different background_education background_education . 

advice : need more diversity in team .
l'oreal recruit way to many intern to many   or people from associations_student association .
recommendation be to look more outside the company . 

<WORK_OF_ART> <WORK_OF_ART> <WORK_OF_ART> invest a lot in people .

their commitment for enable entrepreneurship be real .
and it be a bit like be at a university , ton of young and motivated people .
inspire vibe and constant exposure to new idea 

 <PERSON> : while management_state management_state be really friendly and easy to approach , I find there be often a huge lack of communication and a lot of disorganization .
some of the manager have almost too much of a lay back attitude and there be sometimes a blurr between <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> ; relationships_business relationship .
the counter can sometimes go for <DATE> without resource such as tester / sample with no explanation and it can be frown upon for you to follow up yourself .
if you have a permanent position high management will generally look out for you a bit more but I find that casual be often forget about / leave in the dark <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> / shift .
there be many time where there be problem with the roster and a few issue with payroll which could be very frustrating .
the ' <ORG> ' approach be great in theory and do create a lot of support between the different team within store ; however , it be way too much work for the managers_state manager to handle on their own and   I think that be where the discrepancy in organisation and lack of communication come from . 

advice : state management_State should not have to look after <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> brand otherwise it get to be way too much for they and the employee and counter suffer because of it . 

pro : L'Oreal offer an excellent social aspect and a lot of training_quality training_quality and experience in sale .
the perks_job perk be wonderful with free product and the team_management team_management be really friendly and easy to approach .
if you be work here while study its an excellent job , however , if you do want to pursue a career in beauty or management there be a lot of opportunity and room for progression .

the culture_company culture_company be very hierarchical if you have a low position you
  will be ignore or talk down to or most likely not even listen to .   
I feel the company be get away with abuse intern because most of the intern be young and do not have any previous experience_work experience_work .

<PERSON> : <PERSON> mandate_Vaccine ; <ORG> planning_product planning_product ; <WORK_OF_ART> <WORK_OF_ART> <WORK_OF_ART> <WORK_OF_ART> balance_Life ; <ORG> tool can be terrible ; <ORG> win over technical Advice_excellence 
 advice : this be advice for <ORG> ( <ORG> <ORG> Manager_Group ) / skip - managers_level manager on my most recent team in particular : 

 do not sit in an tower_ivory tower_ivory , separate from the day - to - day reality of engineer .
structure your channels_communication channel in Teams such that the team actually feel like a team .
for unknown reason , our communication be spread out over multiple groups_Teams group_Teams : my team be force to keep its channel in a <ORG> group_Teams for the large org ; I have no idea where the other teams_engineering team communicate with each other .
I be not even sure what our org structure look like - who work on our product across the globe .
we should have have an all - meeting_Hands meeting_Hands once per quarter - not once per year .
or maybe an email_update email_update here and there . 


perform research_user research_user before you ask engineer to implement a feature .
on my team , most of the feature we implement get cut just before or just after they be finish - because research_user research_user have only just finish their testing ( without use the stuff we have just build - so building it be unnecessary ) .
lot of time_engineering time_engineering be waste , and it be demoralize . 


in addition , do not keep pile pressure on engineer along the line of " we should have ship already ! "
when PM / design / research_user research_user have not even decide what we should be build ! ! !
it be laughable to have a fix date_launch date_launch when you do not even know what your new product want to be . 


and if PM / design go through the process of cut feature in order to speed up the time to market , maybe involve engineer in that process .
otherwise you might end up create MORE work instead of reduce it ! !
re - design an entire website & amp ; add new cuts_feature in response to cuts_feature cut be not how you reduce work for engineer ! ! 


the good news : my immediate manager be competent .
Most gpm and levels_skip - level at <ORG> be more competent than the leadership of my most recent team .
it be a mess . 

<WORK_OF_ART> <WORK_OF_ART> <WORK_OF_ART> <WORK_OF_ART> ; <ORG> ; <NORP> security_Job ; <PERSON> ( internal social medium ) ; lot of dls / group ; <GPE> practices_engineering practice

 <PERSON> : the main complaint I hear from people leave <ORG> be that they want to make more money or get promote . 


as I mention in the pro , turn over at <ORG> be pretty low by design .
but that do mean that compare to other place , the opportunity for promotion and big raise be small as well .
generally people either leave by <DATE> <DATE> or stay for <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> at least .
there be a lot of people who have be there for a very , very long time . 


also , good life_work life_work balance_life and culture be the state goal at <ORG> and most team seem to follow it , but not every team be the same . 


there be a lot of different team at <ORG> and reorgs seem to be fairly common -- though it seem about the same as at any large company , not particularly bad here . 


my team only just start do sprint .

personally I have use it to reimburse kits_meal kit , a subscription_peloton subscription_peloton , pet insurance , and a envy_massage envy_massage membership_envy .
the list be really expansive . 


the average tenure at MS on my team be <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> .
People stay a really long time because the philosophy be that they would rather have you take a break than lose all the expertise you have   gain .
be such a large company , the bases_code basis be large and the history be long on pretty much all the project .
the long they keep you , the more valuable you become .
more on that in the con . 


there be plenty of room to move internally when you be ready to do something different , and internal hiring be very common . 


specifically on come out as transgender at <ORG> : 
 my wife and I pay <MONEY> <MONEY> for our insurance_health insurance_health and have a copay of $ <MONEY> for any doctor in the <ORG> system_Kaiser .
the tran healthcare_trans be especially affordable -- <MONEY> <MONEY> <MONEY> for any of the procedures_gender procedures_reassignment procedure .
the lists_wait list be <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> for a transgender surgical consult , which be not terribly short but it be certainly bad other place .  


there be an internal community_transgender community_transgender that have worldwide member .
they have be an incredible support and place to belong .
change my name and pronoun have be completely painless .
a lot of my team be virtual and I have never be misgendere or dead name .
I do not even announce it beyond tell my manager and say in my team chat " hey I be go by X now and update my pronoun to y " and everyone just say great , congrat , and start use it .

 con :
<ORG> tout a diverse and inclusive community , but I find that it be not accurate .
the executive may come from all different area of the world , but they be all from similar educational background , which mean it lack diversity in " thought " and to push against that be very difficult , if you have be at <ORG> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> .  
they recruit a lot of people to join the company , since they be lose people to the competition and well salary , but people that have be at the company for <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> , make it very difficult for new people with " idea " , so the politic be hard to navigate .
there be people that be try to bring innovation to the company , but most of they be frustrated and have give up try to make any significant change to the culture or innovation , until they can find a new gig . 




since new people be not very much embrace by the people that have be there for a long time , progress be very very slow .
primarily , why <ORG> do well in the market , be because they have a good brand , due to the leadership of <GPE> , but that be the reason , not due to innovation . 




many long - time " softie " expertise_lack expertise_lack in their subjects_work subject , so they utilize agency for most of the strategy and execution .
if you really want to participate in the innovation of product or strategy , then I would suggest work for <CARDINAL> of their many agencies_consultant agency . 




People be on <ORG> <ORG> <DATE> <DATE> , every day .
there be no respect for people 's time and people be constantly late for meeting , since they be stick on the previous meeting .
executive assume that <DATE> <DATE> meeting = work , which it do not .
work still have to be conduct , so people do not write or work , until <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> , when they can finally get off a meeting_Teams meeting_Teams . 

advice : if you really want to have diversity and inclusion at <ORG> , then modernize as the other companies_tech company have during the pandemic , and allow for different type of people of thought .
please look beyond hire in <GPE> for talent or force outside talent to relocate to <GPE> .
also , there be so many executive that have be at <ORG> for <DATE> <DATE> that hold back the innovation and do not allow for other 's opinion , hire executive that you will respect their voice .
it be good to listen   and stop suppress new idea . 




lastly , manager need to limit the amount of meeting they have in <DATE> <DATE> ,   as well as , have all of their worker on the meeting , which many time be unnecessary .
staff be afraid of not join a meeting , since manager will penalize they .
manager need to trust their staff and conduct less meeting to create efficiency .  
worker be burn out , since they be stick on <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> meetings_Teams meeting per day .
have so many team meeting do not encourage a healthy work / balance_life balance_life . 

<PERSON> : the benefits_health benefit and perk program be great .
total compensation be comparative , but base salary be less than the other big tech company .
for middle salaries_management salary , it be a great place to be , but for executive , they be not as competitive as an <ORG> or <ORG> .

 con : your overall experience at <ORG> be very team dependent , with some organization ' action contradict the value set by the company 's statement_mission statement_mission .
this manifest in poor cross - team communication , misalignment of interest between team , and tribalism .
this lead to a poor collaborative culture where every team act only in the good interest of their own team , and not for the company as a whole .
how can you empower every person and every organization in the world if you can not even empower your own employee ? 


Compensation be not as competitive as other faang company .
while <ORG> comp_Microsoft be still very good compare to most non - faang company , this signal that <ORG> be not willing to take the initiative to be competitive with their main competitor .
what end up happen be that the good talent end up leave for green pasture and all the mediocre one stay , cause a " drain_brain drain_brain " where standards_engineering standard steadily decrease .
<ORG> be not interested in retain its good talent contrary to their claim . 


it be much easy to interview external company than it be to switch to different organization .
if you want to transfer to a different organization within <ORG> ( say , from <NORP> to Xbox ) , you have to apply to a posting_job posting_job create by the organization of interest and go through an loop_interview loop_interview as if you be an external applicant .
assume they even read your application , you be a <ORG> employee_Microsoft give you no advantage as the loop do not take into account your positive <ORG> , testimonials_manager testimonial , etc .
I have make more progress in <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> worth of external interviewing than I do try to transfer internally for <DATE> .
yes , <ORG> be entrench in various market , but you most likely will not be able to enter most of they unless if you boomerang or have connections_insider connection ( which be outside of your control ) .
again , <ORG> be not interested in retain talent despite <ORG> sell you on the idea that they want to keep and cultivate talent . 


work balance_life balance_Work be a hit or miss depend on several variable such as dynamics_team dynamic , your level_seniority level_seniority , and the quality of your dynamics_team 's processes_engineering process .
in my team , engineer be put in rotations_oncall rotation with little to no training in the area_product area_product , poor organization of information , and not be teach to take initiative in solve problem .
this leave the most senior , competent , and knowledgeable engineer be put on <CARDINAL> virtual oncall where they can get ping / page / call / etc during off hour by engineer that be officially oncall but couldn't / wouldn't find relevant information themselves .
I have even be texte several time to come online and help with an issue , while I be on vacation ! 


furthermore , if you be perceive as a competent engineer , expect to be stretch thin with increase responsibility but little to no resource to deliver on say responsibility .
this lead to competent engineer burn out while the mediocre one be able to coast by .
even when bring up in <CARDINAL> - on - one , the issue be dismiss with a nonchalant " we try
but we can not fix it " response .
it be almost as if <ORG> reward mediocrity more than competency .
there be an ongoing myth about <ORG> be the pinnacle of life_work life_work balance_life , but I find that it be mostly true if you be junior or be unmotivated . 


<ORG> claim to be experience_customer obsess and seek to offer a delightful experience_customer experience_customer , but my experience_customer with see poor practices_development practice and see product fail the most basic cases_use case ( imply a lack of testing_quality testing_quality ) lead I to believe this be just another buzzword .
<ORG> be more concerned about cross off checkmark and deliver fast rather than be honest about their product and take corrective action .
this lead to technical debt , loss of morale , and burnout . 


on a slightly unrelated note ; even during my tenure at <ORG> , I have favor compete product over <ORG> 's counterpart .
I will use <PRODUCT> <PRODUCT> over Word any day , <PERSON> over <ORG> , and I end up sell my <PRODUCT> <PRODUCT> but keep my PS4 .
I be not familiar with the team behind those product , but base on my experience here , I would not be surprised if their lack of quality translate to my dissatisfaction with those product . 


tl;dr your mileage may vary at <ORG> as each team be different , so be prepared to jump ship if your working condition do not line up with their promise and you
expectations_r own expectation .
I recommend <ORG> as either a booster_resume booster_resume or as a place to retire . 

advice : if you truly believe in the company 's value such as obsession_customer obsession_customer , cultivate talent , and mindset_growth mindset_growth , walk the talk .
do not just talk the talk .
otherwise , employee who actually practice those value will leave for your competitor . 

pro : good benefit like care_health care_health , <PRODUCT> match , matching_donation matching_donation , access to service_counseling service_counseling , etc . 


<ORG> be entrench in a wide range of market from productivity_office productivity_office , gaming , search , mixed reality , etc . 

 can find coworker with a wide range of interest and hobby outside of work , such as sport and gaming .
lot of internal lists_mailing list for different hobby to facilitate meetup and building_community building_community .

 advice : none 
 pro : it be always good anytime 

 <PERSON> : not busy = mean that it be really quite boring , and not just for my position either the sale team_sales be equally as bored . 




where to start ? 

 • poor training , have no idea what be go on for the majority of my employment and therefore I do not learn anything to help I develop any skill . 

 •lack of communication between all the department , lead to a lot of confusion 

 •manager be way too passive aggressive 

 •the sale team_•The be quite good at return call , however some member of the team_service team_•The just do not care ( I do not blame they ) but the consequence be that customer get angry at le receptionist .
( which reminder , be not train for ) 

 •diversity be probably good , the other employee have low key racist comment or discriminatory comment to certain race etc . 




additional things_meh thing : 

 •the layout_•The of the place make it very hard to see thing and do my job 

 •update areas_employee area please , the toilet be horrible , the kitchen be just grim and have very basic thing , just a kettle actually 

 •You would think for a multi million or billion company they would provide more for the staff like lunch , well utility , even care and that be free 

 <PRODUCT> be not pay which be just stupid 



 probably a lot more , but my experience be mine alone .
I would not recommend work here in the dealership as they be quite boring , high pressure , confused management and bad work / balance_life balance_life . 

advice : be well . 

pro : not a busy environment which be both a pro and con * 

 con : will not be give any meaningful work or work at all .
Most of <DATE> <DATE> in spend dreaming_day dream .
hr   and payroll be not transparent at all and attempt to conceal information from you .
extremely boring and worthless internship unless , you want to experience live in <GPE> .
almost all other intern will be people that major in   <NORP> Studies_Asian   with no knowledge on <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> / the automotive industry .
no " native " <NORP> speaker , most employee <PERCENT> <PERCENT> of employee be either <NORP> or <NORP> .
so , if your <NORP> be not very good , it will be a difficult experience .
<ORG> be an extremely boring part of <GPE> and if give the option , goto <GPE> .
although , your salary will not go very far in <GPE> .
it will be <PERCENT> <PERCENT> well than frequent the same <CARDINAL> bar that close at <TIME> <TIME> every weekend .

if there be not a project or assignment for they , do not hire they .

 pro : Colleagues_Nice colleague to work with 

 <PERSON> :
unfortunately I would say that the hire policy be very strict and depend on your top manager if they hear about you .
work hard and might have a change to be reward , know that a recommendation from the top managment in <ORG> group_Volkswagen be worth a lot if you apoly somwhere else . 

advice : keep up the good job and the management you be follow .
it not uncommon to meet the president of the company and naturally say hi to you because he trully value his employee from intern to top management . 

pro : as your manager be all senior they be just an awesome source of knowledge and inspiration .
I think the management use in <ORG> by some manager be just brillant as they try to put you at the good of your performance .
you will participate all the travel and most the dealer_car dealer_car network_dealer visit and these kind of thing .
<DATE> I can say that I gain in maturity and change a part of how I be work .

1- incompetent skills_management : the skills_management skill of middle and top skills_management be very poor .
<ORDINAL> the manager do not understand how the industry_software industry_software work and then do not have th
inclination_e inclination_e of learn how it work .
the skills_people skills_management skill of most of these manager can be gauge from the fact that a <CARDINAL> team_member team_member have see <CARDINAL> skills_people leave(in <DATE> <DATE> time_years ) because they could not work in the <ORG> IS_VW environment_IS . 






<ORG> <ORG> <ORG> focus_Management : the top manager hardly play any role in the success of the it project .
top / middle manager_project or manager_project manager_project hardly come into picture . 


<CARDINAL> senior manager seem to have just <CARDINAL> point_role   - point_role out to people that " this door can not be use for exit " , " you need to wear tie " " you be only work <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> <TIME> ? ?
" 



 <CARDINAL> - life_work - life_work balance_life : it be a very clear message from manager that developer need to life_work more that the normal hours(No_working hours(No_working , budget do not permit overtime ) . 


their estimate be generally very very poor and people end up work on weekend . 


to give you an idea of the estimate : for <CARDINAL> project the lead_development lead_development estimate <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> of effort_development however the total lead_development effort_development be <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> .. that too when developer have to cut corner to get the minimum functionality deliver . 




I do not think there be even a proper discussion on why the estimate be so wrong . 




<CARDINAL> - development_software development_software process : 

 agile ?  
-no 

 waterfall?-
no 

 adhoc ? - yes 

 wierd ?
-yes 

 depend on the whim and fancy of manager ? -
no ( remember that manager do not come into picture at all ) 

 depend on the whim and fancy of lead ?
- yes and no ( yes , the process_development process_development keep change on the whim and fancy of the lead , however as the lead have no developers_control - developer can divert the process_development at will ) 



 do the process_development work ?
- good question ! ! 






<CARDINAL> - more focus on service_lip service_lip than performance : this organisation do not value performance .
to be really value , one need to be close to either the lead or the manager and if so , then he can get away with murder . 




<CARDINAL> - highly political environment : <PERCENT> <PERCENT> of employee in this department be contractor , include lead and manager_project manager_project .
<ORDINAL> focus of these people be to cover their ^**£% and think about the task in hand later . 


it be a highly political environment .
good people keep leave as they can not survive and the crappie keep accumulate . 




7- not learn from mistake : the bad part be that the <ORG> be department be not learn from its mistake .
I could see the same mistake be repeat over and over again .

 <PERSON> : the earn potential be quite good with a great Cons_quality <ORG> Cons_brand 

 <PERSON> :
<ORG> be a place where they try to create rule to make work efficient and fair for everyone , but the truth be these rule be only apply to certain people . 




for example , there be a rule that <CARDINAL> people with the same education and experience_work experience_work should not be pay differently . 




there be another rule that set levels_payment level ( groups_tariff group ) for people base on experience and education . 




there be a <ORDINAL> " rule " not write anywhere but enforce by hr when they find convenient that say people can not be promote <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> <CARDINAL> tariff up . 




sound all fair , but now , if you tell hr that you be get a salary of x which happen to be way low than you would get at <ORG> with the same experience and education .
they will offer you less than they should , you accept , fair enough , not their fault you do not know well . 




you get hire , you be already make less money than people with the same education and experience and thus there be a rule be break .
then you ask for a raise to put yourself on the same level of your colleague , they say no because you can not be " promote " many tariff like that .
but it be not a promotion as accord to the group_tariff group_tariff that be exactly what you should be pay in the <ORDINAL> place . 




would be great if would stop there .
let us say you have a friend in high place at <ORG> and you do not have the education nor the experience to ask for a high salary .
still , you ask for a category ( salary ) that be mean for someone with <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> <DATE> more experience than you have .
in general , HR would say no to this kind of request but as you come from internal and very important recommendation you get the salary that be not mean for you . 




now you be break <CARDINAL> rule , where you make more money than people more experience and have a category not mean for you , just because of nepotism . 




to make thing even bad , <ORG> pay way less to woman than man . 

advice : manageman at <ORG> be the reason why the company be such much behind innovation .
old manager , with old mentality and old way of do business and managing . 

pro : good name on your <PERSON> and not much pressure .
if you be the kind of person that do not care about your work , that be the place for you .
if you do care about do something meaningful , that be unlikely the place .
