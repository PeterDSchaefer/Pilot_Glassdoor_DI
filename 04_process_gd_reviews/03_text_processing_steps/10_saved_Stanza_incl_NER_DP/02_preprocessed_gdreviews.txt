prioritization of metric and statistic .
although this stat be always important ( they be factore in to determine increases_pay increase ) , I notice new change_leadership change_leadership how they treat different employee over small change_leadership or minor trend in sale metric ( <S-ORG> , trade - in , accessory , connect ) .
- work - life_Work balance_life be not well for a full - role_time role_time .

extreme lack of production due to this problem , usually amplify by the high amount of customer we see at our small and less employ store .
Slight anti-union attitude , but no outright call against they .
we see other large store in city unionize , I know some of my fellow employee be oppose to the idea give the dissent from life_work - life_work balance_life .
advice : - New management be treat many employee differently , do favor for they or their customer , or prioritize they for promotion base on sale statistic .
this be something that be trend bad before I leave .

they say they could afford the <S-ORG> demand .
then , as soon as the deal with the union be sign , they announce a <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> buyback_stock buyback_$ .

manager skill vary a lot , so depend on which team you be at it can be great or not so much .
they still do have <S-CARDINAL> review , which could help the company to find out how their manager perform .
be prepare for a lot of overtime , rather a hectic time_day time_day and never - ending change .
the <S-ORG> team_HR be not what can be expect from the company at that level .
quite a lot of person get stress out and sick .

this can create a feeling that thing be not always smooth or define .
it be not consider a bad thing for the organization , as it have work for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , but it be not always easy for newcomer to understand .
you have to be someone that want to work in ambiguity and constant change .
advice : none pro :
my favorite part of the <S-NORP> culture_L'Oreal be the never - end quest to create and innovate .
no matter what your job be , you will be expect to find new and good way to work and to challenge the old way of think .
Leadership be more accessible than most company of similar size , and top manager encourage junior staff to disagree with they and create a opportunity for debate - this be how we get our good idea !
<S-CARDINAL> of the perk be that you will never need to buy any products_beauty or grooming product ( at least not a full price ) .
there always seem to be free goods or you can shop in the <S-ORG> stores_company store .

even though I leave the company grateful I also leave it exhaust .
I have experience be harass , bully and award all in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> and that be not a unique situation , its expect .
advice : hire , promote and train leader that can do more than manage their operational task at hand .
promote the one who actually lead , develop talent sustainably and empower .
you can only rely on the excuse of " the <S-NORP> style_work style_work " for so long .
what be the real reason your turnover amongst newly hire be so high ?
develop next leaders_generation leader instead of just marketeer and you will be invincible .
pro :

<B-DATE> <E-DATE> , <S-CARDINAL> country and <S-CARDINAL> position late - this company teach I everything I know about sale , marketing and digital .

if you have a amazing idea you will always be allow to develop it .
con :
while in some company trainees_management trainee have their own project , a lot of department where you get your rotation treat you as a free labor to do the most boring work .
many manager do understand that you be pay twice as much as a basic intern , and it would be more useful for the company and the trainee to give more interesting project with some responsibility .
so my advice be to ask upfront for a specific project ( as it will help you gain experience_management experience_management ) , and avoid routine work which person just try to get rid of ( it do teach you anything and do bring any value ) or try to share it , otherwise your motivation will dissapear very soon .
it seem also that headcount in some department be not right at all - some person work till <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> very often , while other always leave at <B-TIME> <E-TIME> ( not because they be more efficient )
advice : develop a specific program for each trainee with project they can be solely responsible for .
tell manager that it a waste of resource to give a lot of work_routine work_routine to trainees_management trainee ( they be pay sometimes more than junior managers_brand manager and more than most " positions_specialist " position )
pro : a lot of nice person , no code_dress code_dress , free lunch
con : <S-CARDINAL> . the internship be real hard work , especially when you in the sale team_sales .
it drive you crazy to fulfill the sale target_sales .

so you get emotional every now and then .
<S-CARDINAL> . they do have great culture , but they not open for mistake , you can have any excuse if you do get your job do .
advice : when I be work there , I do get any mentor around I , I make mistake and I fix they .
the <S-ORG> do really care about each of its employee that much .
pro : <S-CARDINAL> . if you a current student_college student_college in <S-GPE> , especially a junior one , it be a great opportunity for you to apply for <B-ORG> <E-ORG> at <B-ORG> <E-ORG> .
it challenge you a lot no matter which department you work for .
and it help a lot for the late process_interview process_interview of their <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> .
<S-CARDINAL> great team_HR team_HR , really professional , they advise you and help you prepare everything .

and the working environment be great , you see your peer be all professional and outstanding .
con : - overtly aggressive corporate culture .
Always a sense of work_urgency - work_urgency life_work balance_life be non-existant -
not introvert friendly , must be over the top and fake to fit in .
sheep - like_Sheep atmosphere .
- pay for <B-TIME> <E-TIME> however the workload of my collègue and I require <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> per week - good for person <B-DATE> <E-DATE> only .
not family friendly as this company_loreal simply do not respect have a life outside of company_loreal - company_loreal leave a ridiculous amount of responsibility on junior employees_level employee with little to no support from upper employees_level or mentor .
they then pass it of as '' entrepreneurial '' - <S-CARDINAL> of the company consist of expat from <S-GPE> who have nothing here and have nothing good to do than work <B-TIME> <E-TIME> a day - department work in silo - more time spend in meeting that work on your desk advice :
your corporate culture be toxic and flawed and if not fix employment will be a continuous door_revolving door_revolving .
pro : - competitive salary - good benefit - good school ( get to reinvent the wheel for many project and process ) - good brand on your flex_CV - flex_CV hour , work from home , and hours_summer hour -
not micro manage and leave to make decision that impact the business .

some senior manager will not even recognise junior person exsistence
the ceo think this therefore you think this advice : look for the young bright spark and promote they accordingly not purely on accrued_time accrue
take on consultants_management consultant , they be expensive but they will make you more efficient
all country do not operate the same , a product may work in <S-CARDINAL> place and not in another , local staff need to be able to speak up
senior management from <S-GPE> need to hit reality , dare to speak to some junior person and ask they honestly what they think not just the person try to impress you to get your job .

- HR lie to new recruit , promise they of a job_dream job_dream
- most worker be young , because they be mostly fresh from university or have little experience , still naive , but they soon realize the L'Oreality and leave .
a new set of young naive recruit enter and another set of overworked tired worker leave ... this cycle never end .
advice : hire more person , the problem be that person leave due to high stress because there not enough personnel .
you will always have person leave if you do listen to their need .
everyone be swamp with work .
stop focus on production for a moment and try focus on the real and big problem : employee well - being .

when they decide to merge our brand together , it come with new management , who be complete bully .

there be no fairness in how position be grant .
advice : the arrogance of <B-ORG> <E-ORG> on how they take control of someone career or think what be good for you need to change if they want to keep good person with competency .

but if thing would go bad , you be to blame example : especially in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> in your <S-ORDINAL> job ever , you should be able to ask some question as you be like a alien .
in my case , it be allow to ask " how " question .
you could only suggest a possible set of solution to your manager and he would choose the direction for you .
how you be suppose to get to that option be a mystery .
you can ask around of course but nobody would have time for you .
- tough , unwelcoming culture .

the company be very very <S-NORP> ( infact <S-NORP> ) , hence not very frank a open .
everything be a closely guard secret with formality ( almost royal treatment ) reserve for high management .
company culture_Company be a bit lay back , with tolerance for poor performance ( in other word less accountability ) .
renumeration / benefit be more bargain base rather than be systematic or performance base .

when I request for clarification , it take they <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> to reply .
advice : improve orientation for new expatriate and standardise the structure for packages_expat package around the zone .

I would have have a much good experience if I be in a different brand and do blame <S-ORG> , but have a negative view on the brand and its General manager .
advice : look into certain brand close so you can see how the GM in some brand be good leader and their negative value and outlook feed down into the company .
pro : good benefits_staff benefit of benefits_staff shop_staff and friend and sale_family sale_family and get to be a part of exciting opportunity

con : total lack of respect from management : from one_day one_day I be tell I could never expect to grow up in my career , that I would be stick in the assistant role_Assistant no matter what my performance be .
no surprise since in <S-GPE> it be more of " who you know " that matter rather than you be a good professional .
I be treat like a maid many time and have to use the word " doctor " before their name like they some kind of special person .
once I give a suggestion and the director_marketing director_marketing respond for I to go to away and not give suggestion .
no training or support be give , they expect for you to know everything just because .
I be happy to get away from this place and I do recommend the department_Marketing department_Marketing at <S-GPE> in <S-GPE> to no one , unless of course you one of " team_who you know " team_who .

criterion for promotion not well define .
if you not in the trainee_management trainee_management program_trainee , you will have trouble move ahead .

what salary be you expect ?

there be always room for improvement .
advice : keep give feedback to your employee .

great to have on your cv.
con : very hierarchical structure_company structure_company , result in very long making_decision making_decision process and also result in stress stressed_out person since top management in <S-GPE> have no idea / do care of the workload .
everybody be stress out and depressed .
very bad work / balance_life balance_life .
lo salary .
<B-TIME> <E-TIME> decision and change all the time , partly because none of the manager dare to say " no " to <S-GPE> .
very competitive culture , also internally .
a lot of responsibility but not the same amount of control over decision - very frustrating .
very old - fashion it / report systme .
a lot of time spend on report to <S-GPE> - could have be spend on develop the business .
manager have good technical skill , but very poor person skill .
advice : take care of your employee - this would benefit the company as well sine the rate_turnover rate_turnover be extremely high and a lot of knowledge be lot and money spend every time a good employee leave / burn out .
pro : steap curve_learning curve_learning , good colleague , nice product
con :
not many con to say , not any con to say really , I believe if I be force into say a con it would be that " I wish they speak to we more on a personal basis after the brandstorm be conclude , they really do seem like very fun person to talk to " .
advice : none pro : before I talk about the pro and con its very important to state that I have work within the company itself or ever be a integral part of the <S-ORG> community_Loreal ( on a corporate basis ) , however , I do spend some time work with the representative of loreal in order to come up with our brandstorm .
pros : amazing person , they give you a sense of a unbelievably fun and dynamic environment , highly intelligent they really do know what they do .
end up <S-ORDINAL> place .
con : work life_Work balance_life do not exist
senior management have their own agenda for you , it do matter what you want
the pay be terrible
very competitive .
stressful environment ... backstab person advice : stop treat your talented , high potential person badly or they will leave to go work someplace else .
maybe you should consider what be good for they sometimes and not about your own agenda all the time .
this be person and they want to be happy at their job .
pro : great experience in that I learn a great deal while I be there .
great preparation for go to another company , because if you can make it <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> at <S-ORG> , you can make it anywhere !
everything else be a breeze after you spend <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> there
benefite be good and good perk ( product , etc. . . )
con : Super long hours_working hour and operational mess that you be continuously clear .
it can get very tiring advice : the focus be always on the side_marketing side_marketing .
need to focus on other function and empower they to build a more balanced place_work place_work pro :
it a open culture with a flat hierarchy .
the company be very agile you be allow to trial New thing and even if it fail the managment support you and give you a feedback .
there be no fix process hence you can bring about any kind of change .
if you be a asset and a performer you be expose to the <S-ORG> leadership .
also they tend to load everything to the person who do most the work that to I be a opportunity to learn so much
con : above everything else , <S-ORG> be exceptional at sale - sell the product to customer , sell " opportunity " to new employee , and especially sell a certain type of delusion to everyone who work there .
here be the main difficulty I face while work at <S-GPE> :
- <S-CARDINAL> out of <S-CARDINAL> senior and mid-level manager be generally unequipped for the role
this mean a lack of understanding of what it mean to manage in a professional sense ( set objective , define scope_role scope_role and responsibility , remove roadblock , etc. ) , but what more concerning , be that a lot of management be unequipped for the scope_role emotionally - with no ability to empathize or understand the need of the subordinate , they be follow only because the employee have to follow they .
- ego + &gt_Politics &gt_Politics ; merit + result
I vividly recall my manager obsess over the most insignificant detail on a deck_powerpoint deck_powerpoint , only to ensure that when he or she present it to upper management , she be see as a " superstar " .
I also recall manipulate the datum to make a fail launch look " good " , just so my manager could have good news to share .
there be a general preference for ignore datum - drive decision in favour of whatever make the manager in question look good .
- emotional abuse
it be a regular occurrence to see co-worker cry .
it even more commonplace to have a vacant role on any give team because the employee be on " sick leave_stress " a.k.a. " leave_stress - leave_stress " a.k.a. " burn- out " .
the scary part be that no one be bother by either of the above because they happen so frequently .
- hardcore cool - culture_aid culture_aid
there be a strong expectation that everyone who work at <S-ORG> must absolutely love it all the time , never mention anything negative , and always show intention of stay at the company until retirement .
if you as much as mention that you might have a interest in perhaps explore another industry or company way down the line , you will be tell to keep quiet as it will damage your progression_career progression_career .
the ironic part be that <B-GPE> <E-GPE> have by far the high rate_turnover rate_turnover in the industry , and force employee to always pretend to be " love the experience " only make it more difficult to get to the cause_root cause_root of the problem .
- lack of ethical backbone
I can disclose any detail relate to development_product development_product for legal reason , but there be a lot of very questionable development_product both from a point_efficacy point_stand - point_efficacy as well as from the positioning_consumer positioning_consumer standpoint_positioning .
advice : without sound like a break record - please take off your <S-PRODUCT> - tint glasses and assess the state of the company objectively .
the issue I mention have be voice <S-CARDINAL> of time over <B-DATE> <E-DATE> and no one have do anything about it .
you know what the problem be , you just need to choose to resolve they .

everyone have a feeling that something " not right " with the environment_work environment_work .
the rate_turnover rate_turnover be very high to begin with , and person work until <B-TIME> <E-TIME> be not unusual .
they talk openly about ethics and diversity but they do practice what they preach .
it all just for show to attract young talent .

I be push by a senior manager and <S-ORG> to work the <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <I-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> day without complaint .
I try to explain many time that it be detrimental to my mental health and my relationship at home but they defend the " <S-NORP> culture_L'Oreal " and say it have to do with the " competence " they want to see if I ever want to get a promotion .
I remember feel sad and depressed but they reprimand I for not be grateful to be work there .
as a disciplinary measure they extend my period_probation period_probation and I be eligible for a increase_salary increase_salary since then .
when a coworker find I cry in the bathroom she say " do worry , I have see so many person cry here at <S-GPE> " .
we even have a term for it at the office : " Leave_Burnout leave " .
besides that , I also witness strange incident such as :
- Black female employee be the less likely to have their contract renew and many of they be " subcontractor " which mean they get pay less than permanent and do receive any benefit despite work in the same office .

work environment be fun and person be great to work with !
definitely not a gossipy environment as some claim .
career development be there if you ask for it
will listen to employee opinion and improve welfare to enhance life_work - life_work balance_life
con :
this be a <S-NORP> company that operate as the <S-NORP> do .
it very political , and hierarchical , and you do have to learn the politics to get ahead .
they always say you have to manage your own career at <S-ORG> , and it true .
you have to know what you want and learn exactly the right way to push , and who to become friend with - not everything be merit base .
and god forbid you ever show a bit of emotion - the masculine culture of manufacturing_L'Oreal manufacturing_L'Oreal may come as a bit of a surprise , consider it a cosmetic company_cosmetics .
there be no woman past a certain level , so be aware that you can move forward quickly at the beginning , but you will probably have to get out after <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> if you really want to move ahead .
the downside of quick responsibility be tha
t they give you little - to - no training_job - it all " on the training_job " training_job , but this be the way_L'Oreal way_L'Oreal , and we have all come to accept it , even if we do like it .
finally , the " abilities_leadership " ability of much of the management leave much to be desire .
the top guy be between good and great , but there be a lot of person under they who do really know how to manage ... and I do think <S-PERSON> have do a good job in correct that yet .
advice : worry about the fact that even though <S-PERSON> be vote <S-CARDINAL> of the top spot to start a career , it be consistantly not rank above the top company to work for .
Young person be willing to work hard and produce really good work , but when they see their peer , or their predecessor do the same and still not get reward just because they do play the game exactly right , this be a problem .
at some point " experience " do not count as a part of compensation .
finally , you hire smart person , but you do trust they to do smart thing .
pro : Young , dynamic co-worker make it easy to have a social life , especially if you move from elsewhere .
there something special about work for a company whose product you see on the shelf at the salon or in <S-PRODUCT> or even the counter_make - up counter_make at <S-ORG> .
they do give you a lot of responsability right off the bat , and if you continue to perform , you can move ahead , as long as you learn your way through the politics .
finally , as long as you perform well ( average , even ) , your job be not at stake - <S-ORG> hold onto its employee sometimes well after their date_expiration date_expiration , but this also give you the chance to make mistake and take risk without ruin your future .
if you do fit in <S-CARDINAL> position , they will try you out in another , because when they hire you , somewhere they see a spark of something that they want to see shine .
con : - very bureaucratic environment
- poor management significantly impact morale_team morale_team
- lack of upward mobility if you be unwilling to move to <S-GPE>
- Communication between office_head office_head and teams_field team_office be problematic ; feedback from teams_field team_office be rarely lead to improvement in strategy

Young leadership that need to be shap .
poor management_HR management_HR with lack of undertsand what leadership trully mean ( despite the country ) advice : please management_HR , be care to your employee .
understand who your public be and enable they for what they can acutally become .
do not hinder person growth due to your frustration .
leader ... be mature before you aim to grow in your career , your knowhow and expertise have to match your emotional maturity , after all your <S-ORDINAL> product be the peple you work with !
pro :
you will be very autonomy to create new procedure , millenial workstyle_millenials , awesome brand to work with
con : - Sad to see new talented waste
- never see a company with such a high turnover ever
- no one be really good at what they be do because they be only in a position for a year or <S-CARDINAL> ( by choice , or not by choice )
- good " play the game right " or be play -- see too many employee leave because they just could take it advice : realize that new talent hire have more potential than the position give to they ...
it be up to management to test their limit & set they up for failure or success .

con :
the inequality between the different division be alot .
office staff_Office eat on glass and overall normal plate while staff_factory staff_Office eat on plates_metal plate .
employee work on <S-ORG> products_consumer product division_Loreal have extremely high benefit compare to staff work on local product ( which ironically sell more ) .
extremely low salary for intern , trainees_management trainee and that on contract .
slow making_decision making_decision .
frequent resignation .
few growth_career growth_career opportunity for local .
advice : you have to make thing more equal in <S-GPE> .
for the company to grow , discrimmination have to stop .
make everyone feel as if the role they play in the company be value .
get more local in high up position as they understand <B-LOC> <E-LOC> more , especially in sale and marketing .
pro :
no code_dress code_dress .
Open policy_door policy_door .
con :
since there be some many interlocutor and speaker , it sometimes become hard to be quick and flexible to launch campaign to the market .
also , it a highly competitive environment with lot of related_business - related_business pressure , and it become quite hard to keep a balance_work / balance_life balance_work .
advice : need to simplify processes_work process : less meeting , more feedback_concese feedback_concese , more analysis of result pro : your manager trust you from the very <S-ORDINAL> moment you start processes_work at the company .
you be entitle and responsible for your position and can easily get visibility to top levels_management level .
it easy to learn from cross-functional team and , if you perform correctly , you be give the chance to grow in the company .
con : high turnover and constant change of management in the company .
it get tiring have to re-establish relationship with new manager , in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> you can have <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> different manager .
all the hard work you do to prove yourself with your previous manager can be waste .
because here , it do matter what you do <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , what be you do <B-TIME> <E-TIME> ?
<B-TIME> <E-TIME> .
if there be a international visit be prepare to work weekend and <B-TIME> <E-TIME> .
sometimes this visit be a surprise and they tell you to prepare in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> ( mostly rare ) .
you end up prepare <S-CARDINAL> different slides_ppt. slide , <S-CARDINAL> of which might actually be use .
the entire process_visit process_visit be such a waste of time , you basically put on a big show for the big international boss .
I have hear bad thing about they , I typically hear that they be pretty friendly , but it just a waste of time .
everyone be stress out and run around like chicken with their head cut off .
<B-ORG> <E-ORG> .
this be so huge here .
like the comment above , its all about put on a show .
make it seem like you do so much work and its amazing .
everything be control by HR , and they be watch / analyze you every move .
it all about if they like you , performance have less to do than you would expect .
lot of backstabbing .
but at <S-ORDINAL> its so hidden , you do realize anything once you have the rosy shade on from be so excited to get hire .
then slowly you see case where upper management suddenly vanish from the company .
person will throw you under the bus to get ahead .
poor system_value system_value .
do trust anyone !
everyone be look out for themselves .
logistic and IT suck here .
you think that a company that be so cut edge in innovation , they would invest more in their logistic management_logistics system and operation .
especially be a giant_CPG giant_CPG .
expect computer from <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> ( kid . but seriously : crappy IT ) .
it slow down your work , frustrating .
poor management ( sometimes ) :
if you have a bad manager , all I say be good luck !
you can be the hard working , most intelligent employee and if they do like you , you screw .
if your manager do know what they do , good luck !
this typical do happen , but it do ( I guess this be a risk at all company )
but do dare voice your opinion to HR , because their motto be " too bad , it your responsibility to deal with it " advice : relax , it just a stick of lipstick .
you not cure cancer .
pro : discount product

con : difficult to have a working and private balance_life balance_life , difficult to get support when you face difficulty with your manager_line manager_line , difficult to evolve if you do know the good person ( lack of transparency in the management_career management_career sometimes ) advice :
take the principle of manage with generosity as a value that have to guide your business_day to business_day business_day .
make managers_line manager accountable for the way they manage their team in stead of take only into account the quantifiable objective set .
pro : multinational company that have a lot of mean to develop its staff , compensation and benefit , multiplicity of paths_career path , autonomy
con : complete and utter disorganisation , hide by ' be entrepreneurial ' .
i.e. do what you want , and if it work , pat on the back , but if it do , I would have some stitch ready to patch up the wound_knife wound_knife lod in your back ( metaphorically speak ) .
I can see the company be try to make it a nice environment for their staff , such as implement agile hours_working hour ( something that have be in the industry for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> already in other company ) , but it just do work .
person at the top of <S-GPE> be far too stubborn , old school , and do believe in change .
therefore , if you dare work from home , which be the new policy , I would bank on get a promotion anytime soon .
in my opinion , the only way
<S-PERSON> be go to become a top place to work be if they get a good old sweeping brush , and have a good management_clean out of old management_clean at the top , to then bring in fresh thinker who be not brainwash by the old house_school <S-NORP> house_power house_school that rule the roost .
advice : go on a course_training course_training at a company_FMCG like <S-ORG> or another top place to work company_FMCG company_FMCG ( check the time top place to work for inspiration ) , take all the learning you can from what they do , and then implement it at <S-ORG> .
sound easy say than do , but there be no other business in the industry that have a high turn_staff turn_staff over than <S-ORG> .
they must be do something right , and <S-PERSON> must be do something wrong .
pro : great experience_business experience_business due to a lot of responsibility .
you be basically put under that much pressure that you be force to learn at a rapid pace .
great if you want to go on the apprentice .
person be brilliant though , and you can have a great laugh .
con :
where to begin ...
the team be extremely low on headcount , to the point where flexible / home working have to be bring in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> and this have be readily jump to try and escape <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> ( which be and still be the norm ) .
I have colleague who have constructively complain about the hours_working hour effectively manage out of the company for be " inefficient " .
everyone know what be happen so it just mean that person stop complain about the workload .
unfortunately the one manage out for inefficiency ( not I ) tend to be the ' nice guy / girl ' .
the working environment be very cut throat .
individual working_team seem to work well but cross working_team working_team be difficult as everyone be try to come up with the good idea ( and then take the credit ) .
<S-ORG> , snam etc. not only have to do their own job but be also organised into ' teams_brand team ' , which be essentially marketing_trade marketing_trade role .
this be all extra work on top of your job_day job_day ( whether you look after <S-ORG> or <S-ORG> it the same ) .
write presentation on the way to meetings_customer meeting be normal because you just could find the time due to all the internal priority .
this ' teams_brand team ' go some way to explain the extra <B-TIME> <E-TIME> everyone do <B-DATE> <E-DATE> that be unpaid .
Talk of pay , it low for the industry .
nam start somewhere around the late sort_£ <S-MONEY> to mid sort_£ <S-MONEY> , and snam be in the early sort_£ <S-MONEY> to low sort_£ <S-MONEY> sort_£ of range .
when you add in the long working hour , which mean on average you earn somewhere around the <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> per hour range as a snam , you have to question whether your life and investment in your education have be worth it for that , particularly be base in <S-GPE> .
the final thing I will add be that when I decide to leave and be interview I have to defend the fact that I have work at <S-ORG> to <S-CARDINAL> different company that I interview with , which be surprising .
l'oreal worker be see as arrogant by the wide companies_FMCG cultures_company and I find myself have to say in interview that I be not the typical <S-ORG> employee_L'Oreal in order to show that I would fit in with their cultures_company culture .
advice : try to give your sale team more choice in what they do in term of commercial planning - have a junior manager_product manager_product tell a <S-ORG> or <B-ORG> <E-ORG> what to do in this field will only ever lead to conflict .
remember that you employ a young team who do actually want to experience <S-GPE> life_London during <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
think retention !
the rate_churn rate_churn at <S-GPE> be ridiculous and it feel like person be leave every other week .

this be due to the scheme_grad scheme_grad be project base and the internship be operational .

manager will play a psychological game to save their reputation to HR .
they will tell you to go home in person with smile and concern but in reality you know you can because they push <B-TIME> <E-TIME> of work on you at <B-TIME> <E-TIME> so you end up either stay late at the office or take your laptop home to finish .
my contract say <B-TIME> <E-TIME> , I be easily work <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> a week and sometimes finish work on <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
you try and keep up with the endless demand of manager who will have you redo the same powerpoint <S-CARDINAL> time ( I be not over exaggerate this be how many time I rework a powerpoint once that be just use for a internal meeting ) .
the culture_company culture_company be very hierarchical if you have a low position you
will be ignore or talk down to or most likely not even listen to .
I feel the company be get away with abuse intern because most of the intern be young and do not have any previous experience_work experience_work .
also no one report the bad behavior because they be rely on their manager to recommend they in order to get hire .
when I try to speak up and say something to HR I be ignore and brush aside and tell to speak transparently with my manager who be regularly condescending , her constructive criticism on a presentation_powerpoint presentation_powerpoint I complete with another intern be '' the beginning be pretty and the end be get shitter and shitter . ''
let just say she make <B-WORK_OF_ART> <I-WORK_OF_ART> <I-WORK_OF_ART> <E-WORK_OF_ART> look like a nice person .
work here be only worth your time if you have a upper position_management position_management in this company .
work as a intern you be pay <S-CARDINAL> ( <S-CARDINAL> but <S-CARDINAL> be take out every month for tax ) and as a junior if you do get hire you will be get pay <S-CARDINAL> per month and barley scrape by in <S-GPE> while you give your entire life to a company that do appreciate you - I would recommend it .
also they will try and entice you to stay for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> because at <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> you have access to share .
all of my manager work for the company for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> and its the only thing they know in their working career - I honestly pity they because they do not know that life can be so much good .
I want to quit this internship and I could I have to finish it in order to validate my master - this be how it be do here in <S-GPE> .
the company know this .
they know they own you for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> and you will be able to get out - my recommendation be do run_start - run_start away while you still can .
advice : more accountability need to be place on manager and how they treat intern .
I contact previous intern that also work underneath the same female manager and they all have the same experience of bullying as I .

how good your life will be depend
entirely on your manager .
if you be unlucky your tenure will be short .
<S-ORG> do reorg yearly it seem .
the management do not seem to match person with team very well after a reorg .
if you end up in a team that be not a match the you be stuck and will have to look for another job .
find another position inside <S-ORG> will require that you interview again , exactly as if you apply from outside <S-ORG> .
there be many company that pay much good and offer more interesting work .
I can recommend <S-ORG> .

too much work , busy schedule / advice : none pro : great environment they say , I think its true .
con : vaccine mandate_Vaccine ; chaotic planning_product planning_product ; bad work / life balance_Life ; Internal tool can be terrible ; Politics win over technical Advice_excellence advice :
this be advice for <S-ORG> ( <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> ) / level_skip - level_skip manager on my most recent team in particular :
do sit in a ivory tower , separate from the realities_day - to - realities_day reality of engineer .
structure your channels_communication channel in team such that the team actually feel like a team .
for unknown reason , our communication be spread out over multiple team group_Teams : my team be force to keep its channel in a team group_Teams for the large org ; I have no idea where the other teams_engineering team communicate with each other .
I be even sure what our structure_org structure_org look like - who work on our product across the globe .
we should have have a all - hand meeting_Hands once per quarter - not once per year .
or maybe a email_update email_update here and there .
perform research_user research_user before you ask engineer to implement a feature .
on my team , most of the feature we implement get cut just before or just after they be finish - because research_user research_user have only just finish their testing ( without use the stuff we have just build - so build it be unnecessary ) .
lot of time_engineering time_engineering be waste , and it be demoralize .
in addition , do keep pile pressure on engineer along the line of " we should have ship already ! " when p.m. / design / research_user research_user have even decide what we should be build !!!
it laughable to have a fix date_launch date_launch when you do even know what your new product want to be .
and if <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> go through the process of cut feature in order to speed up the time to market , maybe involve engineer in that process .
otherwise you might end up create more work instead of reduce it !!
re-design a entire &amp_website &amp_website ; add new cuts_feature in response to cuts_feature cut be not how you reduce work for engineer !!
the good news : my immediate manager be competent .
most gpm and levels_skip - level at <S-ORG> be more competent than the leadership of my most recent team .
it be a mess .

con :
the main complaint I hear from person leave <S-ORG> be that they want to make more money or get promote .
as I mention in the pro , turn over at MS be pretty low by design .
but that do mean that compare to other place , the opportunity for promotion and big raise be small as well .
generally person either leave by <B-DATE> <E-DATE> or stay for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> at least .
there a lot of person who have be there for a very , very long time .
also , good balance_work balance_life balance_work and culture be the state goal at <S-ORG> and most team seem to follow it , but not every team be the same .
there be a lot of different team at <S-ORG> and reorg seem to be fairly common -- though it seem about the same as at any large company , not particularly bad here .
my team only just start do sprint .
for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> plus <S-ORG> places_work here , I struggle without the framework of agile that I become use to at previous places_work place .
it get good on my dependent_team , and I know that super dependent_team dependent_team as well .
advice : this be a great place to work , but only because I on a team with a good manager .
most manager seem to be good manager here .
pro : I start at <S-ORG> a few month into the pandemic and from <B-DATE> <E-DATE> I experience management as compassionate and commit to take care of person as person .
crunch have be rare on my team .
I work on a service large enough that I only the on engineer_call engineer_call about once every <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
perks+ benefit -- a yearly amount_reimbursement amount_reimbursement of $ <S-MONEY> for things_health and wellness thing .
personally I use it to reimburse kits_meal kit , a subscription_peloton subscription_peloton , insurance_pet insurance_pet , and a membership_massage membership_envy membership_massage .
the list be really expansive .
the average tenure at MS on my team be <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
person stay a really long time because the philosophy be that they rather have you take a break than lose all the expertise you gain .
be such a large company , the bases_code basis be large and the history be long on pretty much all the project .
the long they keep you , the more valuable you become .
more on that in the con .
there plenty of room to move internally when you ready to do something different , and internal hiring be very common .
specifically on come out as transgender at <S-ORG> : my wife and I pay <B-MONEY> <E-MONEY> for our insurance_health insurance_health and have a copay of $ <S-MONEY> for any doctor in the <S-ORG> system_Kaiser .
the trans healthcare be especially affordable -- <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> for any of the procedures_gender procedures_reassignment procedure .
the lists_wait list be <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> for a transgender surgical consult , which be terribly short but it certainly bad other place .
there a internal transgender community that have worldwide member .
they be a incredible support and place to belong .
change my name and pronoun have be completely painless .
a lot of my team be virtual and I never be misgender or dead name .
I do even announce it beyond tell my manager and say in my team chat " hey I go by <S-PERSON> now and update my pronoun to y " and everyone just say great , congrat , and start use it .

con : mildly political corporate climate - difficult to move internally without intensive networking advice : none pro : great work life balance and person
con : <S-ORG> tout a diverse and inclusive community , but I find that it be not accurate .
the executive may come from all different area of the world , but they be all from similar educational background , which mean it lack diversity in " thought " and to push against that be very difficult , if you have be at <S-ORG> <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
they recruit a lot of person to join the company , since they be lose person to the competition and good salary , but person that have be at the company for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , make it very difficult for new person with " idea " , so the politics be hard to navigate .
there be person that be try to bring innovation to the company , but most of they be frustrated and have give up try to make any significant change to the culture or innovation , until they can find a new gig .
since new person be not very much embrace by the person that have be there for a long time , progress be very very slow .
primarily , why <S-ORG> do well in the market , be because they have a good brand , due to the leadership of <S-PERSON> , but that the reason , not due to innovation .
many long - time " softy " lack expertise in their subjects_work subject , so they utilize agency for most of the strategy and execution .
if you really want to participate in the innovation of product or strategy , then I would suggest work for <S-CARDINAL> of their many agencies_consultant agency .
person be on <B-ORG> <E-ORG> all day , every day .
there no respect for person time and person be constantly late for meeting , since they be stick on the previous meeting .
Executive assume that <B-DATE> <E-DATE> meeting = work , which it do .
work still have to be conduct , so person do write or work , until the end of the day , when they can finally get off a team meeting_Teams .
advice :
if you really want to have diversity and inclusion at <S-ORG> , then modernize as the other companies_tech company have during the pandemic , and allow for different type of person of thought .
please look beyond hire in <S-GPE> for talent or force outside talent to relocate to <S-GPE> .
also , there be so many executive that have be at <S-ORG> for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> that hold back the innovation and do allow for other opinion , hire executive that you will respect their voice .
it good to listen and stop suppress new idea .
lastly , manager need to limit the amount of meeting they have in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , as well as , have all of their worker on the meeting , which many time be unnecessary .
staff be afraid of not join a meeting , since manager will penalize they .
manager need to trust their staff and conduct less meeting to create efficiency .
worker be burn out , since they be stuck on <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> team meeting per day .
have so many team meeting do encourage a healthy balance_work / balance_life balance_work .
pro :
the benefits_health benefit and perk program be great .
total compensation be comparative , but salary_base salary_base be less than the other big <S-ORG> company .
for middle salaries_management salary , it a great place to be , but for executive , they be not as competitive as a <S-ORG> or <S-ORG> .
<S-PERSON> be great and truly be inspirational for try to change the culture of the company .

con :
if you below a certain level_job level_job ( e.g. , <S-CARDINAL> ) , <S-ORG> be really cheap on your total compensation compare to other big companies_technology company like <S-ORG> , <S-PRODUCT> , or <S-ORG> .
person have be leave in drove during the great resignation to go to competitor that have be pay more , and <S-ORG> be now realize it need to do something to stop the bleeding of early and mid-career to competitor and startup .
despite know employee be unhappy with compensation in this high &amp_inflation &amp_inflation ; high cost_gas cost_gas environment_cost , the leadership_company leadership_company be do anything transformational that make <S-ORG> the leader when it come to compensation .
the company be do across the salary_board salary_board cut <B-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> for employee in certain state like <S-GPE> , <S-GPE> , and <S-GPE> ( no exception ) , and this be in no way beneficial to the employee in this state as they try to grow their presence and recruit person there .
<S-ORG> be also a " culture_rest and vest " culture_rest where there have be person who have stay at the company for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> and do have to do much work .
if you look for a place to increase your trajectory_career trajectory_career velocity_trajectory , definitely look somewhere else .

other big peers_tech peer ( and even startup ) be steamroll you in this category while senior leadership continue to tell person " think about the life_work - life_work balance_life that you get " .
it be frustrating and make person feel not value at all .
I know you think about keep the <S-ORG> ; a item_line item_line on the sheet_balance sheet_balance minimal and try to maximize income_net income_operating income_net by keep salary cheap , but it be a terrible long strategy_term strategy_term for attract and retain good person .
also , if you go to cut salary of person in different state without tell they ( after they have move there during the pandemic ) , at least come forward with explain why you think their new low salary be good and attractive for they .
I know you would do
that , but some explanation be good than no explanation .
pro : I really like the benefit that be offer by <S-ORG> - they actually do a good job here .
that be the only reason I give <S-CARDINAL> star to the rating for " compensation and benefit " - the benefit lift it up .
otherwise , it would be a <S-CARDINAL> - rating_star rating_star for that category .

<S-ORG> be not interested in retain its good talent contrary to their claim .
it be much easy to interview external company than it be to switch to different organization .
if you want to transfer to a different organization within <S-ORG> ( say , from <S-ORG> to <S-ORG> ) , you have to apply to a posting_job posting_job create by the organization of interest and go through a loop_interview loop_interview as if you a external applicant .
assume they even read your application , you be a <S-ORG> employee_Microsoft give you no advantage as the loop do not take into account your positive connect , testimonials_manager testimonial , etc. .
I make more progress in a few month worth of external interview than I do try to transfer internally for <S-DATE> .
yes , <S-ORG> be entrench in various market , but you most likely will be able to enter most of they unless if you boomer or have connections_insider connection ( which be outside of your control ) .
again , <S-ORG> be not interested in retain talent despite <S-ORG> sell you on the idea that they want to keep and cultivate talent .
work life_Work balance_life be a hit or miss depend on several variable such as dynamics_team dynamic , your level_seniority level_seniority , and the quality of your dynamics_team processes_engineering process .
in my team , engineer be put in rotations_oncall rotation with little to no training in the area_product area_product , poor organization of information , and not be teach to take initiative in solve problem .
this leave the most senior , competent , and knowledgeable engineer be put on oncall_24/7 virtual oncall_24/7 where they can get ping / page / call / etc. during off hour by engineer that be officially oncall_24/7 but could / would find relevant information themselves .
I even be text several time to come online and help with a issue , while I be on vacation !
furthermore , if you perceive as a competent engineer , expect to be stretch thin with increase responsibility but little to no resource to deliver on say responsibility .
this lead to competent engineer burn out while the mediocre one be able to coast by .
even when bring up in <S-CARDINAL> - on - one , the issue be dismiss with a nonchalant " we try but we can fix it " response .
it almost as if <S-ORG> reward mediocrity more than competency .
there be a ongoing myth about <S-ORG> be the pinnacle of balance_work balance_life balance_work , but I find that it mostly true if you junior or be unmotivated .
<S-ORG> claim to be experience_customer obsessed and seek to offer a delightful experience_customer experience_customer , but my experience_customer with see poor practices_development practice and see product fail the most basic cases_use case ( imply a lack of testing_quality testing_quality ) lead I to believe this be just another buzzword .
<S-ORG> be more concerned about cross off checkmark and deliver fast rather than be honest about their product and take corrective action .
this lead to technical debt , loss of morale , and burnout .
on a slightly unrelated note ; even during my tenure at <S-ORG> , <S-ORG> favor compete product over <S-ORG> counterpart .
I use Docs_Google Docs_Google over Word any day , <S-ORG> over <S-ORG> , and I end up sell my <B-PRODUCT> <E-PRODUCT> but keep my <S-PRODUCT> .
I not familiar with the team behind that product , but base on my experience here , I would be surprise if their lack of quality translate to my dissatisfaction with that product .
tl ; dr your mileage may vary at <S-ORG> as each team be different , so be prepare to jump ship if your conditions_working condition do line up with their promise and you
be own expectation .
I recommend <S-ORG> as either a booster_resume booster_resume or as a place to retire .
advice :
if you truly believe in the company value such as obsession_customer obsession_customer , cultivate talent , and mindset_growth mindset_growth , walk the talk .
do just talk the talk .
otherwise , employee who actually practice that value will leave for your competitor .
pro : good benefit like care_health care_health , matching_401k matching_401k , matching_donation matching_401k , access to service_counseling service_counseling , etc. .
<S-ORG> be entrench in a wide range of market from productivity_office productivity_office , gaming , search , mix reality , etc. .

<S-CARDINAL> example be that when freshers_college fresher join , their team be decide by <S-ORG> as compare to the person work in the team themselves
there be a policy_retention policy_bonus policy_retention , wherein one have to work for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> to get the assure package , otherwise have to return the policy_retention policy_bonus part_retention of the salary , which be <B-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of the total <S-DATE> compensation .

manager have really bother take time hire quality staff .
zero experience_Zero staff_experience join the company at high rank and high Advice_salary advice :
it really bad to see members_staff member be put through there pace to apply for promotion or managerial role only to find someone with no experience_training experience_training , no relevant background be put forward to a high position_management position_management .
only because they know someone high in the company to be put forward for the role .
do be surprised if you see someones , friend , husband or wife join the company only because they want the money and not the job .
this have once , it happen multiple time .
Internal recruitment and HR have to put up with it and then have to give some long winded speech on why they be good then you .
HR and internal recruitment be just bad person and they will fold down to upper management to decide who enter <S-ORG> .
it really embarrassing and I feel bad for some of the more highly talented person I work with to hear they say that to I .
unfortunately , <S-CARDINAL> time out of <S-CARDINAL> , they would just leave and find good job who respect there talent rather then who they know in the company .
<S-ORG> can make the company good but because the culture_work culture_work in some department be basically : '' no one care what you think '' .
there no point in work in such harsh condition .
there a also a
bully culture at <S-ORG> which again , why no one speak about it ?
it simple : HR do care and will do anything about it .
enjoy work with talentless person .

they have many level of test and if you be not able to clear that test you might lose your job and test be not relevant to your work at all .
test be the level of like you be work for " <S-ORG> " .
3.origin of politics be rating -
they have <S-DATE> rating to employee from <S-CARDINAL> to <S-CARDINAL> . ( <S-CARDINAL> be good <S-CARDINAL> be bad ) .
for that they need to maintain <S-ORG> curve_Bell .
which result around <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> employee_% will fall in to rating <S-CARDINAL> & <S-CARDINAL> .
end result_End be no hike for that employee and they have maximum <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> to get a new job as <S-ORG> will start ask to they to search a new job they will throw out of project .
though if you get <S-CARDINAL> or <S-CARDINAL> rating no issue at all .
if you be a new joiner then you have fair enough chance to get <S-CARDINAL> & <S-CARDINAL> rating .
<S-CARDINAL> . no balance_work balance_life balance_work you have to complete <B-TIME> <E-TIME> in office_side office_side barrier_office not do this will effect your salary .

con :
the executive leadership have completely disconnect itself from the reality of the COVID_post - COVID_post workspace_COVID .
they lose all compassion for employee and now follow their own desire and feeling of how productivity_work " should be " rather than consider actual datum when it come to make decision that affect the life of their employee and their productivity_work productivity_work .
they have abandon <S-ORG> goals_sustainability goal .
they have abandon <B-FAC> <E-FAC> ; I goal .
advice : stop make assumption that actual datum do support .
you be not as smart as you think you be .
drop the ego and listen .
<S-CARDINAL> : there be no restriction prevent employee from work in the office .
if we want to do that , we already would be .
force it be foolish .
treat we as the adult we be .
this <S-ORG> policy_RTO will cause a wave of quiet - quit ( and actual quit ) and only board / executive will be to blame for that massive loss of productivity .
<S-CARDINAL> : your force return to policy_office policy_office mean <S-ORG> have commit to its goals_sustainability goal by pledge to put <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> of car back on the road over <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
congratulation on that .
pro : over <B-DATE> <E-DATE> at <S-ORG> and I have find my colleague to be incredibly smart and dedicate .
the work be fascinating .
up until <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , I would have also ( and have ) say top leadership generally strive to take care of its employee as much as it can though that be no long the case , sadly .
con : up until <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , then when the <S-ORDINAL> round of termination happen hope and culture slowly become toxic .
termination happen without any reason , seem like person where just number to ensure <S-ORG> get their bonus .
<B-DATE> <E-DATE> board_year get a huge bonus and we have another round of termination .
manager have no say who get terminate , L1 who do not know individual dictate the decision .
person who work with future project where cut off due to lack of knowledge .
people_AI be future , people_AI person get sack nonetheless .
<S-ORG> culture_SAP be dead and replace by a culture_SAP of zombie and ignorance , except if you work in <B-ORG> <E-ORG> .
salary be purposely low .
Recent round of termination happen without give reason as to why , push down from leadership .
Mandatory <S-ORG> be because of empowerment_employee empowerment_employee , more because of corporate implications_state tax implication .
employee be now just a number , culture be dead , aspiration to do more be dead .
advice : Always tell the why and do treat employee like number that exist only to ensure some ceo and bonus_board bonus_board .
start to embrace new way of independent controlling_self control , controlling_self hiring_self team .
treat person like human not machine pro :
over <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> I have love <S-ORG> .
colleague always want to help , when ceo speak you become proud .
<S-ORDINAL> <S-PERSON> leave then <S-PERSON> ...
con :
in my personal expereince , increases_compensation be not align with other big companies_tech company and you have to be strategic in your moves_career move in order to gain meaningful increases_compensation increase .
<S-ORG> tout " future of work " as a strategic area but the working environment and policy be lag compare to the industry .
board mandate pass down to local HR for implementation often make HR look like the bad guy when really we be just put in charge of operationalize unpopular policy create by execs_out - of - touch exec in <S-GPE> .
in the <S-GPE> , there be a general resentment towards <S-NORP> colleague as they get much good benefit and protection from their worker council .
the <S-NORP> think that we be spoiled with high salary when in reality this be a small prize_consolation prize_consolation for the expense that we incur ( healthcare_employee healthcare_employee cost , debt_student debt_student , affordable crisis_housing crisis_housing , lack of public transportation , I could go on ) .
the <S-GPE> usually get the short end of the stick at <S-ORG> since we be expect to produce the most value for the company while simultaneously be the easy to cut during time of layoff and cut back .
advice : listen to your employee .
change and innovation be important for progress but you have to balance it .
too much change too quickly be alientay your employee .
I have hear so many person say " <S-ORG> do feel like <S-ORG> anymore " .
pro : Affordable high - benefits_quality benefit in the <S-GPE> and a company that generally care about it person .
lot of internal opportunities_growth opportunity , particularly for someone in the field_HR field_HR .
it a good than average company to work for , but nowhere be perfect .
con : - salary wayyyyy below average_market average_market , no merit increase , the more you stay here the less you make ( Increases_SAP average_market increase at <S-GPE> be <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> even for top performer ) , its easy to switch team internally or leave <S-ORG> and return to get a good compensation - or bring a outside offer .
- yoy record profit that employee be not see <B-MONEY> <E-MONEY> , but <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> for shares_buyback share ?
easy peasy - Double board salary ?
easy peasy - Mandatory return to Office despite increase cost of sustainability_living - sustainability_living goal just for show - unless the goal be to put <S-CARDINAL> thousand car on the road increase pollution and accident - ceo with no holds_experience - hold father_position due father_position be a politician and founder friend .
- <S-ORG> be also just for show , if you be not a white german male your chance of reach L1 - L3 be minimal - DEI at <S-ORG> be only for the one at the bottom , the '' early talent '' .
advice : none pro : our <S-ORG> work overtime to delete <S-CARDINAL> reviews_star review on <S-ORG>
con :
it a gear toward the interest and career of <S-NORP> employee .
during recent restructuring , all <S-NORP> employee be protect from layoff , so the <S-GPE> side_US take the hit .
the restructuring be not over , and so <S-GPE> - base person should consider stay away .
advice : stop coddle <S-NORP> employee .
pro : solid benefit .
a culture that tend to respect boundaries_work / life boundary .
salary and structuring_bonus structuring_bonus tend to be good when you join , then it difficult to get good raise year to year .
con :
the downfall of this company will be that nobody train the new generation .
I be hire in a group of <B-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> other early employees_talent employee , and nobody in our group have see a promotion .
it have be realize the only way to grow be to leave , which be unfortunate because it be a great company .
advice : no more team of <S-CARDINAL> +.
I should be speak with my manager <S-DATE> at least , not 2 x a year .
management should not be a formula of " x_work x_work amount_x of year and you become a manager " .
manager should be truly helpful to who they manage and knowledgeable of their team .
pro : nobody be look over your shoulder demand you be present and work <B-TIME> <E-TIME> a day <B-DATE> <E-DATE> a week , objective be task base , and if completely with high quality , be trust in delivery .
benefit be <S-ORDINAL> to none .
great coworker .
con :
the pay be very low give that the workload have increase significantly due to change throughout the company .
there be barely any increases_pay increase once a year .
we should be give increases_pay increase throughout <B-DATE> <E-DATE> advice : increases_pay the employee more money if you be go to increase the workload pro : flexible time off , however you still have to ask other to cover your work which feel like another job in itself
con : <S-ORG> and other break promise slow move Advice_Politics advice : " keep the promise " be one of your core value .
I suggest you have a hard look at it as you break it for force employee back into the office who be hire as remote for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , work in many zones_time zone with geographically diverse team , and do a outstanding job .
it be utter stupidity .
pro : great people_caring person Interesting Benefits_work benefit WLB_Benefits be great until <S-DATE>
con : <S-ORG> to work be no long flexible .
have to be in office <B-DATE> <E-DATE> per week and any flexibility be discretion_manager discretion_manager ( if you do have a good discretion_manager , you have <S-CARDINAL> flexibility ) .
layoff be over , minimal raise , no promotion , but more work than ever .
advice : when you say flexible , be flexible .
go back to <B-DATE> <E-DATE> in office with more leeway .
understand and adjust because less employee mean less work will get do or everyone will be more burn out than they already be .
very low morale mean output will be low .
pro : decent pay , if you have a good manager you will have a decent experience .
con : <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> betray its <S-CARDINAL> + employee on <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , at <S-TIME> <B-EVENT> <E-EVENT> .
we receive a notification that employee must work in the office <B-DATE> <E-DATE> per week even though we have be a remote culture for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
most employee at <S-ORG> join , at least in part , because we have a remote culture .
for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , our lob actively support remote work .
we never discriminate against <S-ORG> employee .
we have a remote culture_work culture_work before <S-EVENT> , and it be critical to the ease with which we navigate the pandemic .
nobody expect the execu
tive board to betray our culture and person like this .
realistically , I suspect this be all a attempt for <S-ORG> to avoid lay person off <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
if they institute a <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> - in - of fice policy_day , they darn well know that a significant percentage of its population will quit .
what a shame .
I probably be amongst they if this policy go into effect for real in <S-DATE> .

overcommunication bore ( but be highly effective ) , and under cripples_communication cripple !

con :
to many reorganization , to much complaxity advice : none pro : large company with a lot of opportunity
con : work - life_Work balance_life be not good .
although not official , there be a " committee_leadership committee_leadership " within support_product support_product where they decide person life and if they do like you , there be no promotion .
hard work will get you a promotion be a sycophant with the group_leadership group_leadership will .
lack of transparency .
advice : none pro : learning opportunity .
salary be ok .
con : again , the experience depend on your place in the organization .
the experience , for example , in <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> ( a function_support / consulting function_support ) can be condescending .
while never the target myself , I see other publicly berate multiple time when they could have be coach instead .
additionally , if you make a mistake in front of certain leadership , it would be very difficult to recover from .
I do not experience either of this element from other units_business unit I serve in .
there be specific leader , who have be raise in the organization over a long period of time , who be ultimately responsible for both of this issue .
to be fair , some of that same leader have some redeem quality as well -- include really go to bat for person when it be time for a raise .
but that quality be not enough to overcome the negative for the leadership in place .
if after a long time work at the company you decide to pursue a change_career change_career , I would advise not try to complete the transition within <S-ORG> .
one might think it would be easy to change internally , it be not .
there be a huge headcount be culture_gold culture_gold among managers_hiring manager ; which be likely true in many organization .
however , at <S-ORG> it make it incredibly difficult to make a change even with transferable skill .
it essentially make managers_hiring manager unwilling to take a chance that they might take otherwise , on someone who have great transferable skill but might not have the functional background ( which they could learn ) .
example of my own experience include : - <S-CARDINAL> 10_+ interview for <S-CARDINAL> position , but then have a external consultant choose instead - a manager tell I I do have enough experience in their function despite the fact that I be willing to reduce my grade in order to grow and have significant level of transferable skill .
- many hir
ing manager , after <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> ( sometimes more ) interview , never get back to you ; you find out week late through automated notification that you do get the job ; when they do let you know , they almost never respond to request for feedback that would help you grow advice : provide training_leadership training_leadership on how to deliver feedback ( specifically to the member of what be the Global CoE in <S-DATE> ) .
transform from the headcount be culture_gold culture_hiring culture_gold and take chance , specifically on long tenure internal applicant try to make a change .
you find they to be motivate , quick to learn , and a passionate member of the team .
reduce the number of interview -- <S-CARDINAL> interview be not uncommon , in <S-CARDINAL> case I experience <S-CARDINAL> + .
it a waste of time and money for <S-ORG> and a horrible experience for the candidate .
infuse empathy into the process_hiring process_hiring .
you might not be able to reply to every external candidate you interview .
Internal candidate be take a risk by apply and if you be go to put they through <S-CARDINAL> , <S-CARDINAL> , <S-CARDINAL> , <S-CARDINAL> interview and not be willing to reply when they ask for feedback so they can improve , you be add to a negative experience_employee experience_employee .
<S-ORG> do a project <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> about moment that matter in the experience_employee experience_employee ; hear feedback be a moment that matter for I , and honestly , not hear it over and over make I feel that I do matter to <S-ORG> .
pro : I spend <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> at <S-ORG> , so obviously there be many good thing .
the experience you have be go to differ ( sometimes drastically ) depend on the part of the business you work in .
if you be in the technical space , it a amazing place to grow -- over time you could stay in the same role and work on many different technology because they be always evolve .
if you be into solving_problem solving_problem , its also a really good place to work -- they have the tool and methodology for cause_root cause_root analysis_cause in support_customer support_customer and you learn a ton even if you already good at it .
person tend to stay in the organization for a long time or return to work there after step away .
over the time I work there , I see incredible growth and transformation , and over that time I continue to have good benefit , and good bonus .
I learn a lot .
con :

they will push any raise you get into your bonus to avoid pay you more money in your salary_base salary_base .
they have very old approaches_school hierarchical approach to everything and fight against change that could be innovative and beneficial unless it come from someone they be friend with or align politically with .
it a very political organization which do a great job of pretend they care about diversity and inclusion but they demonstrate that they do not through hiring and promote person who be unqualified for their role while overlook person internally who be qualified .
their internal system be inefficient and there be continual duplication of work due to poor practices_planning and communication practice .
it the most uninspiring , tedious organization I have ever work for outside of the <S-GPE> government_US .
the most egregious thing they do be create unnecessary obstacle to get work do through process that be ineffective and cumbersome , which be continually change without notice or information .
beyond all of that , the other incredibly harmful cultural norm they have be to never have a discussion about resource beyond headcount .
there be no discussion of whether we have enough resource to get schedule_work do just the expectation that if you be tell this need to be do you will find a way to add it to your already overwhelming schedule_work schedule_work .
this lead to mediocre work that have no real impact on the organization or work that create no real contribution because no one take the time to create a realistic driven_resource - drive project that hold up to reasonable scrutiny .

con :
there be a collaborative making_decision making_decision model_making , which sound nice , but it unclear who have what authority because every project be different .
for example , sometimes your boss say yes do make another team help out when you need they .
and if you do contact executive x until too late , then they might not want to help you .
overall , it hard to get be on the edge_cutting edge_cutting of anything because so many person have to be involve with the decision .
and little thing like budgeting be difficult , you manage your budget offline in Excel because access the system be always accurate or up to date , it take <B-DATE> <E-DATE> to get a order_purchase order_purchase open and over a month to get vendor pay .
I come to <S-ORG> through acquisition , and after the merger , I feel my career take a big step backward because half my job be get all of the little thing in line to get something complete .
advice : please encourage good engagement between sale and marketing .
marketing want to help sale but often be keep at arm length_arms , this need to be at the executive , middle management , and individual level_contributor level_contributor .
all projects_marketing project should have sale input_sales , or more ideally input_customer input_sales .
it a big organization , but marketing can do their job from a ivory tower .
pro : nice perk , like a cafeteria at the big office .
also on - gym_site gym_site & dry cleaning available .
relatively easy to work from home when necessary since communication be often via calls_email and conference call .
con : I be in sale at <S-ORG> .
sit here on <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> our group still do not have its compensation plan .
if you be from <S-CARDINAL> of the company they acquire you will not be treat right .
Internal system be awful .
you will be force to use SAP technology for your daily job and its absolutely numbing_mind numb that company buy some of this technology .
I be lucky to hit quota <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , but only <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of the <S-ORG> reps_field rep make their quota <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
<S-ORG> slogan be " SIMPLE_RUN simple " , but if you be work here expect the exact opposite .
<S-CARDINAL> last thing .....
<B-DATE> <E-DATE> they tell we we would not get commission until <S-DATE> , which end up be <S-DATE> .
we literally do not get our <S-ORDINAL> check_commission check_commission until <S-DATE> .
they pull the same thing again <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
as of right now we be be tell that the <S-ORDINAL> check_commission check_commission for <S-DATE> biz_2015 will not come until <S-DATE> .... my guess be they will continue to drag this out .
all of this information be accurate and true .... I hope this help .
advice : any advice you have for management will not matter .
they be too big for your opinion to matter .
at <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> they want the stockholder to be happy and do whatever they can to keep the cost of a sale down .
turnover be inevitable and will only hurt <S-ORG> over time .
pro : I come over from <S-ORG> .
<S-ORG> be a incredible experience .
great money , balance_work / balance_life balance_work , and you feel like you make a difference .

my colleague have have <S-CARDINAL> different manager in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
this lead to a feeling of insecurity_job insecurity_job that be never good .
also , while <S-ORG> be rank <B-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> for diversity by <B-ORG> <E-ORG> , my personal experience do not match that .
there be no person of color on my team .
tangentially , I work with only <S-CARDINAL> woman of color and <S-CARDINAL> man of color .
old employee tend to get re-org out .
the <S-ORG> be white and <S-GPE> with only <S-CARDINAL> woman currently in what I would consider a ' more female " role .
to <S-ORG> credit , they have step up in <S-DATE> to address racial injustice in a meaningful way that have be more than service_lip service_lip .
advice : none pro : <S-ORG> care about its employee .

<S-ORG> have create a culture of person <S-ORDINAL> , whether that be reward its employee with days_bonus day off during <S-EVENT> to ease stress , gift options_stock option or provide amazing free opportunities_learning / class opportunity to ensure health and wellness .
I have never feel that <S-ORG> talk a good talk but do not back it up with action .
there be a clear path for advancement .

<S-CARDINAL> of the large problem at <S-ORG> , which be of no exception to any corporation <B-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> person , be the incredible amount of red tape one must go through to push forward specific initiative - regardless of how press .
it be truly a <S-NORP> company that be not only obsessed with efficiency and achieve true economy of scale ( by staf in such a way that box person in to specialize in <S-CARDINAL> specific function rather than a solid cross-functional understanding of the department in which they work ) , but also in that one must know someone to achieve a promotion with the organization .

<B-GPE> <E-GPE> campus_Alto be in a nice location and in general colleague be easy to work with and have a good attitude towards achieve success , solve problem , etc. .
<S-ORG> typically have long retention , minimal attrition and very few layoff ( almost unheard of ) , which I believe speak to the general happiness and satisfaction of the employee .

<S-ORG> respects a distribute workforce and rely on its global population to influence the direction_company direction_company which empower employee to be influential and successful regardless of where they work , even based_home base employee .
the company desire to build a inclusive workplace , couple with it strong brand as a employer , be allow they to reach underrepresented population of incredible talent who will find a ally in <S-ORG> - a company willing to stray from the norm of systemic oppression , make a deliberate effort to drive parity in the workplace for all demographics of person so that individual can spend their day develop professionally in a environment that empower they to bring everything they be in order to become everything they want .

<S-PERSON> , <S-PERSON> , <S-PERSON> be all smart and very capable at the top , but the person below they in the middle roles_management role be questionable .
the direct sale leadership_sales work hard and care about the person , but at the <S-ORG> and national level_GM they keep play game that demoralize the teams_field sale team .
in the <S-LOC> specifically , they have have <S-CARDINAL> gm’ in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> and the last <S-CARDINAL> be social experiment with unqualified woman .
the most recent <S-ORG> be install <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> and base on credential it be obvious to everyone that the decide factor be that she be a woman .

con :
it can be extremely tough obtain a full - job_time job_time at <S-ORG> .
it seem to be you have to know someone to get it in .
the common path for young talent be to enter as a intern and network internally to find a full - role_time role_time .
<S-ORG> hire a lot of intern and provide they all the opportunity to find a full - job_time job_time , but there be only so many full - job_time job_time available , often lead it to be very competitive .
due to the nature of the industry_software industry_software , technology advance very fast , lead to a constant internal change_structure change_structure .
sometimes this cause team to dissolve and new team to start .
this can be a good and a bad thing depend on the field you work in .
advice : none pro :
the environment_work environment_work be amazing .
employee from all team be easy to engage with and provide guidance if need .
also , the manager do not breathe down your neck while work and be flexible when it come to work hour .
<S-ORG> have a ton of resource for guidance_career guidance_career , which be very appealing for a young professional .
with this come encouragement to try out new position as you progress within your career at <S-ORG> .
<S-ORG> do not want their employee feel bored with their job , so they provide ton of opportunity to try different job out .
S
<S-ORG> also compensate their employee more than well and depend on the team they usually let you live in your desire destination .
con :
so much change happen here , that it slow the pace of operation ...
but not because thing be get do ... because of the enormous amount of technical and organizational debt .
thing move glacially slow here in comparison to other company in the great <S-GPE> area_Seattle .
other groups_business group seem to want to drag their foot for other , so that it take forever to get anything do ... like they be afraid .
sadly , they promote person to person roles_management role that be fit for the position .
it clear that person be not vet as person manager , or be not give proper training and monitor .
poor behavior here not only go unchecked , but it bury organizationally , HR be not much help .
it also impossible to move around the company , there be no support for that want to pivot to other role , and most manager offer none or absolutely bare - bone growth_career growth_career guidance_bones through the <B-ORG> <E-ORG> system_SAP , which pay you only in service_lip service_lip .
I do even think the company have value that be culturally circulate .
the fact that I do know this should concern you .
advice : enable employee to lead and make change , allow they to move quickly , even if it mean stir the pot .
expect and demand that employee shine and bring innovation .
immediately squash with employees_intent employee that promote unhealthy and toxic culture_work culture_work , as this breed acceptance of jerk and hurt your reputation .
encourage employee to move around and create a organizational structure for this to actually happen .
you lose money and knowledge_domain knowledge_domain when employee quit .
pro : nice office and free soda .
con : very low salary , extremely high workload , dismal benefits_healthcare benefit , out of management_touch upper management_touch , etc. .
hard work be not reward .
in fact , it be punish with more responsibility without a increase in pay .
salary in support be very low and they do not reward hard work .
they will never raise salary significantly , even if you change department .
do not plan to stay for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , it will not be worth it .
do not expect to make much more than you be offer when you <S-ORDINAL> join .
the management speak all the time about how wonderful they be , meanwhile they implement policy that do not help the hardworking employee to be good at their job or excel in their career .
advice : stand up for your employee and pay they more .
senior management rhetoric and action be <S-CARDINAL> different thing .
they say they care about their employee , but will not give adequate raise or decent salaries_starting salary to reward loyalty and hard work .
they treat your employee in support very poorly .
they do stand up for they when customer ( or consultant ) be act badly ( such as when customer abuse members_support members_team member ) , and they do pay we anything near what we be worth to the company .
that need to change , or the talent in the organization will continue to leave the company as it have be do recently .

- frequent re-org can be challenging to get use to
- any large company can be difficult to navigate and learn who who .
- compensation be pretty rigid .
it fair but do expect large increases_pay increase .
you can definitely make more elsewhere but the benefit make up for this drawback .

- Diverse and inclusive culture
I think it tell that many person who leave often come back or wish to .
it also say a lot about a company in <B-LOC> <E-LOC> when many employee have be there for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
<S-ORG> be a great company to work for and I feel privileged to work here !
con :
give the size of the company and its many units_business unit , it can be overwhelming to try and absorb all the knowledge , communication etc. of what happen across all the groups_organization / product group / initiative etc. to maintain a feeling that you aware of everything happen that be outside of your area_day to area_day functional area_day / portion of the company .
however , there be amazing tool and webinar , article , announcement , email etc. .
be all save and share to resources_intranet resource so you can go back to it late when there be time you can read and absorb it in real time .
advice : you challenge we to strive for innovation and to bring our good to each day - for ourselves , family , colleague and customer .

all that matter be to achieve bogus internal kpi and targets_revenue target .
- too large a organization with very inefficient middle management often cause a lot of chaos .
it a challenge to get anything through as you spend a lot of time get around the internal barrier .
- almost all major projects_customer project execute be a mess with few person have to burn themselves to get the company out of the ditch .
Cost be easily recover by charge the ignorant customer .
- if you dare challenge the management your career be doom as there be no place for open conversation .
- interestingly after <B-DATE> <E-DATE> <S-ORG> still use a estimate_gut estimate_gut of <S-CARDINAL> or <S-CARDINAL> individual to put together project that run into <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> .
advice : focus on employee , shed some middle management to give some space_breathing space_breathing to help serve customer good .

if you be not part of the cool kid club_kids ( in other word white ) , you will not be select to grow in your career .
there be a lack of minority in leadership as that be not the culture here as compare to any other company_tech company_tech .
<S-ORG> tout itself as a inclusive employer focus on diversity yet for <S-ORG> ; diversity mean equality_gender equality_gender ( but you have to be white ) - it like <S-ORG> jut wake up to equality_gender equality_gender and it be the late buzzword out there .
the other problem here be <S-ORG> be great at marketing itself - it be after all a sale and marketing machine_sales and not a company_software company_software - so reality be very different from the illusion <S-ORG> market itself as in term of diversity_product or person diversity_product .
if it be not for <B-EVENT> <I-EVENT> <E-EVENT> a lot of person would have leave soon .
lastly from a management_performance management_performance perspective_management , it do not matter if you kill yourself to stand out for you probably will make <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> more than the low performer and forget about talk about goals_career goal ( re : see above for explanation ) .
advice :
if you be serious about diversity then stop talk about it , stop market it and act on it .
we can breathe because you do planning_succession planning_succession and leave we out .
we can breathe because you promote your favorite but keep we at the level below to do all the work and pay we less .

unfortunately I report to a insecure , micro-manager with no person skill who be very narrow minded & operate with a pipe_stove pipe_stove mentality_pipe , she feel threaten by anyone who think " outside the box " or dare question her directive .
advice : witness fair amount of " churn & burn " in my specific division as well as and among new hire in <S-GPE> sale for new accounts_target " strategic account " in white space .

con :
the do not hire the good person for the job .
they hire friend and member of their clique .
if you do kiss the right butt you can forget advancement .
if you upset the wrong person they can make your life a living miserable and in some case block you from leave their department .
they do hire manager who have the skill set to empower and educate the team .
when a team be scared to talk to management because they be talk to like <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> it toxic to say the least .
advice : be fair and promote the good person for the job .
take some time to familiarize yourselves with what the department do so that you can lead the team .
just because someone be your buddy_drinking buddy_drinking do mean they deserve to be talk about or talk down to .
notice your talent and take advantage of their ability to make you look good , in most case your team know more about the business than you .
no when you have a exceptional team and treat they all equal .
Open policy_door policy_door mean ..
open your mouth and we show you the door .
pro : <S-ORG> have a competitive program_salary and bonus program_salary .
pay vacation , match <S-CARDINAL> thousand program_K and benefit package_benefits ..
their tools_learning tool be extensive and you will definitely have to rely on that resource .
con : human Resource be far and away the least inspiring group to deal with .
they be accessible and will answer your question , however they rarely take up the banner for the employee .
they be advocates_manager / company <S-ORDINAL> focus and poor advocates_employee advocate .
get promote take a act of congress as manager be give very little budget for promotion , the rank system_ranking use for calculation_bonus calculation_bonus pit team against each other , especially small team and team that have employee scatter across the globe .
be at another large , global company I have see more out of their teams_HR and talent management team in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> that I see in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> at <S-ORG> .
after <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> I want to stay , however after several interview and always lose out to other candidate who have a close connection to the manager_hiring manager_hiring , it be time to move on .
advice : scrap the based_rating base system_bonus system_bonus , appreciate your internal talent more - you force I out after <B-DATE> <E-DATE> because your level_mid level_mid manager hire their buddy instead of look at my qualification .

con : lot of " simplification " recently .
that the horrible euphemism go around now for layoff .
" you be simplify " .
while I fully understand the need to re-align needs_business need around our new product and paradigm_delivery paradigm_delivery , I be concerned that as this layoff have now stretch over <B-DATE> <E-DATE> that we be lower morale , reduce commitment , and perhaps even the ability to deliver to our customer .
everyone run with their head down .
hopefully this change stabilize soon so we can get back to be awesome for our customer .
( and hopefully I survive long enough to be part of that . )
advice :
in the effort to " run simple " everyone within the company be now run scared .
please identify a end to this change and let internal folk know .
person be collaborate now or do anything to stand out .
it hard to strive for excellence in the current climate .
we need to get back to function like the awesome team we once be .

con : I wish there be good communication with change .
we recently have to change our password and there be a lack of communication how to do so and what action would be take if we do not change it .
I think a lot of the rooms_meeting room need to be update and have old equipment that do not work .
it be a window focus company and I wish it be more align with Macs as there be many user out there .

imo too much time spend develop new bell and whistle and not enough time ensure the one already available work as expect .
never work at a place where there be such a abundance of material_training material_training none of which actually help one do their job .
feel like we just make this stuff up as we go , do in large part to the constant add of the aforementioned bell and whistle .
do get a remote job if you do come here to work , make sure you work out of a location_brick and mortar location_brick , will increase your chance tenfold_chances of get notice and promote .
in a frustrating_word - frustrating_word .
advice : fix what we have now .
slow down on the cycles_development cycle .
catch up all documentation to current version of product
conduct interactive <S-PRODUCT> training_VLS for all module with a persons_support person need in mind not a ps consultant_PS .
we need to help fix it , not build it .
have give up on the idea of advancement , do know the right person .
pro : work with <S-ORG> be a blast , great person , high energy , motivate to help business maximize the return on their most expensive investment , their person .
couple this with the model_SaaS model_SaaS and you have a great concept .
con :
the department_support department_support feel like a punishment .
you receive large volume and be harass for update by <S-CARDINAL> or <S-CARDINAL> different person for most of your ticket .
some issue be technical and require a lot of research and thinking .
you can do neither here unless you work extra hour .
to make thing even more insulting , the person who bother support for update get pay more than support .
somebody with no technical background at all can get hire on a team call prefer care and their manager reward they for harass support .
sale and account representative lie to customer about functionality and then when the customer get upset we tell that we need good support .
everything fall back on support and all management do be get in our way and make it hard for we to get anything do .
many of the actual issue we troubleshoot have be around since before I start with the company which be <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
when we bring issue up to management we be tell that we be be negative and then management just talk about how good we be do even though its pretty clear that most customer and most employee be miserable .
they be out of touch .
advice : stop pretend thing be okay when they not .
give employee a reason to stay on a team and learn instead of chase they off to other team .
a lot of you do not belong in management and be only there because you kiss up at happy hour .

it not something that be disguise .
even with micro-promotion , employee quickly become undervalue in contrast to the standards_market standard .

instead that only reduce loyalty_employee loyalty_employee .
why try if there no appreciation or value for go above and beyond ?

con : <S-CARDINAL> . even though <S-ORG> be a huge company_tech company_tech , its own internal system and process be antiquated and disparate .
this can be headache induce , and at time , unnecessarily lengthen the timeframe it take to complete a task .
advice : <S-CARDINAL> . keep on keep on with your commitment to your employee ... we be pay attention and be appreciative of the ongoing effort .
<S-CARDINAL> keep work to shore up and hone your internal process and system ... " Simple_Run simple " should just be a adage for our customer , but for <S-ORG> as well .

<S-CARDINAL> . they be very serious about retain professional person who have soul and be afraid to bear they .
this may not seem like a big deal , but we all know there be plenty of company out there who be dedicate to keep soulless person .
<S-ORG> expect you to be human , and celebrate that humanness .
<S-CARDINAL> . as a lesbian woman in technology , I can honestly say that <S-ORG> be the only company I work for that truly walk the walk regard diversity in the workforce ( other company can surely talk the talk , but execute on little else ) .
<S-ORG> be openly commit to <S-ORG> right .
con : too big to actually accomplish anything advice : none pro : profitable , pay well , great bene
con : income be not such appear .
advice : no pro : everyone be friendly , guideline be clear .
con :
it a very quiet office , to the point that the air from the ac can be distracting .
it a <S-NORP> company so for the most part that mean a cool , <S-NORP> environment , but some of the exec be a little weird .
they very rarely here though , so that have no effect .
ton of intern , a lot who do seem to do anything , give the office a weird hipster , high feeling_school feeling_school .
somewhat hilarious , consider that <S-ORG> make solutions_software solution , the office be so low - tech .
the <S-ORG> " portal_SAP " have to be update by lengthy requests_email request and be pretty useless .
advice : none , I think everyone happy .
pro : <S-ORDINAL> , let I say that <S-ORG> divide it employee into essentially <S-CARDINAL> group , contractor and regular employee .
all the positions_support position ( admin , facility ) be contractor .
<S-ORG> have very deep pocket and pay well , provide great benefit , and offer free lunch .
the office be gorgeous and mostly serve to host meeting .
<S-ORG> be very lay back about time_flex time_flex and work from home , so as a result , the office be almost completely empty on <S-DATE> and rarely get that lively in general .
I suppose it have its politics and silly corporate shenanigan , but for the most part , everyone here be very nice and calm .
con : Proprietary technology be see as superior ( we always do it in ABAP and it good ) .
infrequent weird jerk_knee - jerk_knee micromanagement_jerk from top management .
increase we vs. they ( management versus worker ) away_mentality - away_mentality from the ' we be a culture_team ' culture_team .
there be more and more level of management , although the new ceo want to change that .
there be many department that viciously defend their turf even though their product be unneeded or miss the market .
Talk to customer be leave to a thin layer that do communicate with the person who build the product .
it be hard to make it into high management - generally that be hire from the outside or move in sideways through the <S-ORG> channel_MBA , have no experience_product experience_product .
another downside be that you have to use some of the old product that be really hard to use .
advice : do some management by walk around .
use some of your product .
pro : good benefit and climate_work climate_work .
no hire and mentality_fire mentality_fire .
lot of different department that deal with vastly diverse subject .
person from all over the world work together , <S-GPE> , <S-GPE> , <S-GPE> , <S-GPE> , <S-GPE> , <S-GPE> , <S-NORP> - you name it .
free lunch and generally a person - friendly_people environment_work environment_work .
no nickel and dim on snack and drink at work .
con : training on procedure that be not compatible with system and need to be constantly re-written .
management
leave you to load <S-ORG> app .
yourself ( not IT ) and not able - due to not be the administrator .
get the other ( prior programs_company ) program to work with the completely new system , and still have issue .
Ton of phone_company phone_company - in_phone , phone_company video with a multiple test_answer test_answer at the end , and you must pass .
no free or discount lunch , or <S-PERSON> pass etc. .
really bad system_payroll system_payroll , and the new evaluation_self evaluation_self program_bonus program_evaluation that must be do in like <S-CARDINAL> week . ( it can be compare to a paper_college paper_admission paper_college )
a almost guarantee fail , while have to do your everyday job .
understand <S-NORP> jargon like - ' execute ' to they on a p.c. be = ' enter ' to we .
I do love the <S-NORP> though !
advice : lead by example !
do not expect perfection and pass judgement onto someone , when you the head of the department , and can even do the process , let alone sign on to the computer to do it yourself .
I just say .
pro :
get much need equipment for department .
more time_vacation time_vacation .
move up a little bit on scale_pay scale_pay .
never see any executive .
con :
there seem to be a shift_culture shift_culture now that we be a part of <S-ORG> , as expect .
advice : hire person who be hungry , competitive , and appreciative .
pro :
there be incredible upward mobility for that who put their head down , work hard , and do expect anything to be hand to they .
as in many based_performance - base organization , many of the negative review about unattainable goal or leadership hold employee back , be by low / average performer who expect praise and promotion to be hand to they .
I have experience firsthand how quickly you can move through the rank if go above and beyond goal be a expectation for oneself .
personally , I would encourage anyone who want to get their foot in the door at a great company to start in <B-ORG> <E-ORG> as it have provide a amazing foundation for future success in sale role .
effort be directly correlate to success in this role , so if you come in ready to work hard and earn good money while do it , this be a fantastic role for you .
both director and manager be ultra-transparent about expectation and run the department as a true meritocracy .
<B-ORG> <E-ORG> leadership_Development do a great job broadcast the performance of high performer to leader of other department as to help with promotion .
con : <S-NORP> culture_leadership culture_leadership , no real sense of what make a good person leader_people - this be the major area of focus need by <S-ORG> .
still quite hierarchical , with many old leaders_school autocratic leader lack vision but excessively busy with tactical action .
lot of talk about the future of work and new structure but in action use a <B-DATE> <E-DATE> ok approach to reorganize instead of innovate how to do this humanly - could have be a tanked_think tank opportunity to demonstrate real leadership and do it differently .
what a miss opportunity !
too many reorganization allow mediocre leader with a new boss each year to be overlook in their lack of real contribution .
advice : convene think tank to develop new approach to both major reorg ( recent downsizing ) and annual reorg .
this be a old approach and org need to figure out how to do this more regularly more humanely , respectfully , and without demotivate the vast majority .
you lose a ton of respect and commitment in this recent '' purge '' of highly talented and engage person who be never even acknowledge or thank for their effort over the year .
how appalling !
pro : significant opportunity to learn , with a direction_innovation direction_innovation and strong technical direction_innovation capability_innovation .
ceo be inspiring but not humble .
con :
you have to maintain relationship for promotion , it not really base on performance , if someone you know rise to the top , they will take you with you .
most of the positions_job position be fill without any interview or screen , so you well focus on your skills_networking skill than hard or smart working .
during the <S-EVENT> , they come up with strange restriction which require approval_board at all level , for employee that want to move to another country due to restrictions_visa restriction , process_company process_company require approval_board approval_board , that for <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> expense_USD , talk about run simple .
if you establish a process where nobody but board can take decision for expense of such low value_dollar value_dollar , you just do have trust in your <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> team_leadership team_L3 , Global team_mobility team_L3 in <S-ORG> act like office_government office_government ( no offense to anyone ) , you have to constantly beg they to get your response .
you will be constantly stifle by bureacracies_process bureacracy and follow the chain of blessings_command blessing to get simple thing do , everything be strictly hierarchical .
advice : fix the global process_mobility process_mobility require approval_board approval_board for transfer to different country .
focus on create diversity across all ethnic group in addition to gender and color .
you do see a lot of person of color or ethnicity at levels_L1 , L2 or L3 level .
empower your L3 and below leader , they can make smart decision too .
pro :
it a great company for someone who be not look for a accelarated path_growth path_growth or not dependent on a visa to work .
con :
only your usual balance between when ideal <S-PRODUCT> design could be implement because of the backend and issues_performance issue which require a architecture_lot architecture_lot change .
advice : none pro :
they immediately have everyone work from home in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> when news of the pandemic break out and have be very supportive and flexible .
they give we <B-DATE> <E-DATE> to use for crisis leave like take care of family or decompress as kid be at home ; this be not for sick leave which you use if you or anyone in your family get <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
they even send all employee reusable masks_cloth mask to use and keep we update on the current <B-EVENT> <I-EVENT> <E-EVENT> situation_Covid worldwide .
prior to all this it be great go into work and meeting with colleague and eat lunch together .
now our whole <S-ORG> department_UX meet on virtual chat every <S-DATE> or so just to chat during hour_lunch hour_lunch about stuff_none stuff_work stuff_none .
<S-ORG> have also ask for <S-DATE> to not have meeting so person can get work do and flexible to figure out the new norm with stay at home .
the most resent building_team building_team be arrange for we to do virtual remote escape room in building_team of <S-CARDINAL> or painting as a building_team get a kit at home .
con :
not really , very happy there advice : none pro : great company to work for
con :
it not really a con , but <S-ORG> be a highly virtualized meaning_environment - mean you need to build your network .
your network be how you get thing do and push project through .
there be many team at <S-ORG> and you need to quickly learn which one you should interact with depend on your role .
advice : none pro : <S-ORG> be a great place to work .
there be many thing to do , whether you be a geek_code geek_code , want to work with customer or partner , sale , marketing - so many role to choose from .
I switch group every <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> because there be so much to learn .
other person stay in the same gig their entire career .
<S-CARDINAL> of the thing I love most be the diversity of person you get to work with .
you will meet person from all over the world , depend on your role , you may also get to travel all over the world .
I have position where I fly every week , one where I fly every quarter to other country , and one that require no travel .
I work at home or be on the road - so this job fit my life well .
love work at <S-ORG> .
con :
the large business come with some of the expect con of a large business .
it can be difficult to keep up with all of the different team and navigate the big <S-ORG> world_SAP .
we be constantly work to simplify process and restructure to mitigate this issue , but with this size of a business it persist .
advice : provide a functional chart_organization chart_organization ( name_team name_team and short description ) especially when a reorganization take place would help employee navigate this change .
remember that while we appreciate the " big picture " what we really want be the detail and " how it affect I " which seem to be miss in the large announcements_change announcement .
pro :
the person : we have a very dedicated and talented workforce who be great to work with every day .
many of my colleague have become good friend .
the package_benefit : <S-ORG> offer a wonderful and well round package_benefit package_benefit .
the culture : our employee actually take to heart the desire behavior to build a wonderful working culture do thing like build bridge , tell it like it be , and keep their promise .

great benefit
con : - pay be way below market in the valley .
lot of good talent leave .
- some team responsibility overlap when each other - which lead to waste_resource waste_resource .
- career growth_Career may be limit .
management care about achieve kpi and not focus on individual development_career development_career .
advice : - adjust pay to align with standard_market standard_market , especially for the one that join <S-ORG> straight out of school .
- clear up each team responsibility .
no <S-CARDINAL> team should share the same responsibility .
- invest more on development_career development_career plan_development like training and provide opportunity for each employee to work on projects_side project of their choice - it will profit the company in the long .
focus on <S-DATE> kpi do not solve issue and have fail in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
pro : - lot of opportunity to move around internally - for technical and non-technical role .
- flexible work from policy_home policy_home ( can depend on your team ) .
for many senior position , you can pick up your kid and have flexible hour .
- free lunch daily ( can depe
nd on your location ) .
- as the company be big , you can easily make connection with different person .
- lot of opportunity to learn if you look hard enough .
- good culture in the company_tech company_industry - company_tech respects your time and be flexible with your emergency .
nice coworker and you will make lifelong friend here .
con :
the driven_consensus drive culture that be instil in the company by its strong <S-NORP> root can at time paralyze making_decision making_decision process , and slow reaction to competition .
( that say , the company have become much good at react in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> . )
sometimes too many person be consult on decisions_management decision that should be make at low level .
the geographical spread of the broad organization , and the dispersion of functional and marketing unit , can add a significant degree of complexity to go to market and other outs_company wide outs_roll out .
that say , this global footprint be a serious advantage in deal with large client .
advice : give low manager more leeway in making_decision making_decision .
pro : at <B-ORG> <E-ORG> ( and <B-ORG> <E-ORG> ) you be surround by top talent from across the globe .
the benefit be industry competitive and the environment_work environment_work be unparalleled for a customer_business - customer_business focus firm_customer .
the company be extremely accommodatating when it come to work need ( time off ; work from home ) .
consensus drive culture mean that manager ( both direct and top level ) take the time to consider input from low down the chain_food chain_food .
significant work occur across department and across geography , so you be expose to a variety of personality and system , which make thing very interesting at time , for good or bad .
con : pay be very poor and low advice : none pro : balance_worrk like balance_worrk be good
con : be a very large organization , get thing do take a bit long .
more approval require , more person involve , more " red tape " .
not quite as nimble as a small org , but this be understansable and something we just learn to work with !
advice : continue to invest in your person .
the program and resource that have be bring to we over <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> be incredible , and have be well receive by that take advantage of they .
thank you for see the benefit in program focus on mental health , especially during this uncertain time when we be all balance_work from home , and struggle to keep balance_work / life balance_work in check .
pro :
the culture at <B-ORG> <E-ORG> would be hard to beat anywhere else .
I have work at several different company , and have never feel more like a family any other place .
the person here truly care about one another , want to see other succeed , and be willing to go the extra mile to ensure everyone have a happy balance_work / balance_life balance_work .
family always come <S-ORDINAL> , and there be a level of respect and trust exhibit with our leader .
not only be this a incredibly strong company , but also have such amazing person to work with be what make it a place I plan to remain until I retire .
con :
almost all of the talent and smart person have already leave .
there be a few good person leave but would be surprise if they leave when the rest of their vests_stock vest .
most of the person leave be the employee that need improvement .
the system_rating system_rating be garbage and rate almost everyone as " deliver well " even if they be a disaster .
only the bad of the bad be rate as " need improvement " so even if someone be a poor performer , they think they be and do make any effort to contribute to the broad team .
high performer be not encourage to do well , only to dumb themselves down to make the low performer feel good .
executive management have no clue how horrible <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> work_day be because the vp and what not paint a rosy picture that be completely incorrect .
Certain vps be promote too quickly and lack experience , while other be never promote even though they should have be .
basically , everything be a mess .
pretty sure the company will only get bad as it get " <S-ORG> - ify " and all the remain good person leave .
I would go back to work here , even if someone offer I <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> a year .
advice : stop believe that everything be fine , take a good hard look at person , fire the low performer , reward the high performer , and actually move the needle instead of just say you will .
pro : benefit , location , free lunch , beautiful office
con : <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> acquisition_SAP , the company , as one would expect function more like a large , large , institutionalize corporation .
still plenty of talent and good person , but definitely a different outlook on ethic_work ethic_work , drive success , and make great thing happen .
<S-ORG> be go through its own internal struggle , try to at once preserve its software_enterprise software_enterprise model_business model_software , and adapt to the cloud .
if you apply to work at <S-ORG> in a location other than <B-LOC> <E-LOC> , this be probably a great choice_career choice_career for you , or if you want a <S-CARDINAL> - 5 er , it probably a great choice_career choice_career wherever you be .
everyone different .
advice : embrace the cloud , run like a up_start - up_start .

if you have a chance to work for <S-PERSON> , and want to be on a ship_rocket ship_rocket , rather than a <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> , take it .
if you look for a steady , <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> job , there certainly nothing wrong with that , everyone be different , but <S-ORG> be not that type of company .
con : <S-CARDINAL> . high expectation
expectation to perform and hit quota be expect with such a competitive structure_salary / structure_comp structure_salary .
should be too much of a surprise to anyone interested in a sale role_sales .
<S-CARDINAL> change
system , process , and change_personnel change_personnel often but that expect consider the nature of work at a company_tech company_tech .
get into a rhythm will take extra effort but overcome obstacle in this role will prove to be extremely valuable experience that you will carry with you throughout the rest of your career .
advice : Upper leadership should sit and shadow rep more often .

it a easy way to boost morale , and it help fast track the systematic roadblock that effect mdr efficiency .

con : sale management_micro management_Sales be off the chart .
I be require to give comprehensive status_deal status_deal report once a week .
but in addition , I get <S-CARDINAL> call and email <S-DATE> ask for update .
<B-ORG> <E-ORG> be entirely focus on simple next steps_closing step , layer of manager be trip over each other to have the very late info .
I a high performer , will make <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , again .
I can leave a important meeting , take <S-CARDINAL> or more call from various manager within <B-TIME> <E-TIME> , and be berate for not have update our <S-ORG> system_CRM call <S-PRODUCT> .
advice : dial back the torrid pace of status_deal status_deal .
hire manager who actually understand issues_customer issues_business issue and <S-ORG> selling_solution and who can coach on selling_solution sell .
the culture have shift to a bunch of managers_spreadsheet managers_jockey manager , compete with each other to have the late info .
a number of account Executive be wonder if the <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> a year be worth it in this environment .
<S-ORDINAL> issue be decline plans_compensation plan for over achiever .
why be management stock option uncapped , while sale plan for that who deliver revenue cap ?
pro : good set_product set_product that work .
con :
only downside be the ability to move around to other position within <S-ORG> .
while employ at <B-ORG> <E-ORG> apply for multiple role that I be qualify for and have not receive a response .
I leave for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , and apply for the same type of role and be contact on every one .
advice : keep do what you be do .
our customer love the new innovation come with <S-ORG> and <S-ORG> .
pro :

I get the chance to work on the late and great software that be not yet well know to the other Big <S-CARDINAL> ( <S-ORG> , <S-ORG> ) and have a blast do so .
my manager be truly awesome and I consider her a friend .
great place to work as long as you be willing to work very hard .
New options_stock option put <S-ORG> package_benefit package_benefit superior to competitor .
the benefit and 401k , competitive pay , benefits_travel benefit ( clubs_airline club ) and reimbursement_tuition reimbursement_tuition have be great .
con : - poorly plan / staff project ; sometimes you will hear of a new project and have to go on site with little to no background and the client / partner will expect a quick turnaround .
team_project be be rush to start implementation when they be not ready , and the internal team_project team_project suffer as a result
- there be more pressure put on internal hire / tenured employee because the time_ramp up time_ramp for new hire can be very slow .
it can seem like manager tell everyone that they be do a awesome job , so employee feel there be no difference between that who do great work and that who be mediocre advice : invest in professional growth , set your team up for success , recognize your value employee ( and compensate they ) ,
and do be afraid to " hurt feeling " when employee be do their Pros_job pro : - great culture ; very open and collaborative , social activity , weekly carts_beer cart , stock kitchen , unique office

- good experience_learning experience_learning , especially for new grad .
you will get to work with extremely intelligent person who be willing to help when they can .
there be also opportunity to switch department depend on what skill you polished and where your interest be
con :
Way too many manager across the company try to prove they can " add value " by mandate you take tests_training and certification test on area that have nothing to do with your job .
even if you have a write plan_bonus plan_bonus , do expect the company to honor it .
if they think you make enough money , they hold some back .
very <S-NORP> culture - there be a process for everything and if you think you be able to get something do quickly , you wrong .
the environment be extremely control in term of recording_time recording_time and processes_expense process .
very , very high pressure , high environment_stress environment_stress with a continuo focus_continuos on " flawless execution " .
should you fail to execute flawlessly , expect to spend a lot of time with your manager discuss your deficiency .
complete focus_management focus_management on appearance , not result .
arrogance towards customer , and a attitude that it completely ok to mislead a prospect about detail as long as you " tell a good story " .
advice : Ditch the recording_time recording_time for <B-ORG> <E-ORG> and principal .
everybody fake the number anyway because you be so explicit about how many hour a week need to be spend in front of customer , how many hour on education , how many hour on prospecting , how many hour on admin , how many hour on prep to sale ....
pro :
it look good on your resume .
if you be in a facing_customer face role , you will learn absolutely top techniques_notch techniques_demo and presentation technique .
con : like any big company , the organization can be difficult to navigate and at time it appear there be overlap between group cause confusion .
I always look for peer that have be with the company <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> ( and there be a lot ) to help with navigation_matrix navigation_matrix advice : none pro : I be with <S-ORG> for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> and have nothing but great thing to say about this company .
I be in focused_IT focus role for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> as a <S-ORG> consultant_PwC , <S-ORG> , sale manager_sales , manager_partner manager_sales and now a manager_product manager_sales , span <S-CARDINAL> different company .
after spend most of my career in roles_management role , I join <S-ORG> as in individual contributor .
I be amaze at how much they value my experience and work hard to ensure that <S-PERSON> challenge and able to completely utilize my intellectual property for the company and our customer .
unlike the last major global company_software company_software where I spend <B-DATE> <E-DATE> and be extremely political , discourage individual contributor , and pride themselves on factor_stress factor_stress , <S-ORG> seem very focus on person , work - balance_life balance_life , and a culture_team culture_team .
I actually love go to work everyday and feel value and appreciate which strengthen my loyalty and dedication to this company .
highly recommend .
con :
the fact that a few seasoned leader must re-assure a huge population of incredibly talented individual that <B-LOC> <E-LOC> be " relevant " and " important " to <S-ORG> , offer insight to the nature of the company .
advice : get the culture under control .
start with yourselves .
a little humility go a long way .
stop build fiefdom , and grow your areas_board area , and start focus on deliver value .
the company be top down , so start with yourselves .
serve your internal and external customer not your own areas_board area .
wake up , engage , stop the metrics_vanity metric , and roll up your sleeve and make a difference by add value and serve beyond your area_board area_board .
pro :
there be a handful of <B-ORG> <E-ORG> executive who be class_world class_world leader .
smart person that understand software_technology , business , and enterprise software_technology .
they also get <B-LOC> <E-LOC> and understand which methodology and innovation can and should be adapt and adopt into a huge , global , company .
that same handful strive to make <S-ORG> a great place to work while striving to make <B-ORG> <E-ORG> ( <B-LOC> <E-LOC> ) relevant .
<B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> value too much on tenure_employee tenure_employee instead of merit .
majority of the employee be lifer and their skill be not up to date yet they feel entitle because of their tenure and internal network .
employee do have input in making_decision making_decision .
Internal fight_food fight_food and politics .
<S-NORP> clique in club_R&D and boy club_R&D in sale and marketing in <B-LOC> <E-LOC> .
weak senior / middle management - throw members_team member under the bus , intimidate employee with punishment to teach they a lesson of obedience , building_empire building_empire , based_fear base culture , no trust and transparency .
too many re-org and senior management turn over .
advice : I admire the executive team_leadership team_leadership however many of their initiative and value be lose down the chain_food chain_food because of many layer of incompetent senior / middle management .
stop push <S-CARDINAL> bake product to your customer .
<S-ORG> leadership_HR need to step up and fix the practices_hazing / punishment practice condon by some manager .
hire from outside so there new perspective and fresh idea .
diversity / inclusion be a culture not a slogan .
go beyond fabricate number and really talk to your front employees_line employee .
pro : Global company , good erp brand_ERP , flexible schedule_work schedule_work , strong executive team_leadership team_leadership
con :
this be a big place with lot of person .
organization be complex and there a lot of overlap .
it can be hard to operate across organizational line when you be even sure which organization do what and own what .
it can feel like you work within a amorphous blob that can only roll uphill or downhill .
in addition the strategy_compensation strategy_compensation be poor .
this be a sale drive company , everyone else be treat like " everyone else " .
promotion be drive by " who next in line " versus " who deserve " .
since compensation be drive by performance , they do try to be creative about find other means to promote performance but that effort generally fall flat and they themselves be fund enough to meet the demand .
the culture_compensation culture_compensation incentive movement_position movement_culture ( even lateral one ) rather than performance to increase your culture_compensation .
advice : none pro : <S-ORG> be a big place , sometimes there literally a job for every little task that can be think of .
if you be great at networking and promoting_self - promote you could move around quite a bit within the company .
there a lot of benefits_fringe benefit and opportunities_learning opportunity that be offer .
some be good for development and some be good for a nice distraction to your day to day .
con : - pay be good .
in the less side of the area_bay area_bay margin_area .
- wlb be ok I guess .
as in any other company in the area_bay area_bay .
- lot of politics around .
good idea to shut up and do your work wear headphone .
- the company do seem to be do so well .
I be see less money be spend on engagement_employee engagement_employee .
we use to have <S-DATE> outing and stuff <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> but now its once in like <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
<S-ORG> normally have a yearly outing to great America but they even cancel that <B-DATE> <E-DATE> say they need money for " processing other employee green card_employees " .
I mean who say that ?
that be so bizarre .
we get some horrible trucks_food truck where it take my <B-TIME> <E-TIME> to get a small slider I be not even kid .
overall with the recent layoff and other small thing go on here and there I be not very sure about the future about this company and look like a sink ship .
advice : none pro : - free lunch and recently add complimentary breakfast
- amazing campus around alto_palo alto_palo
- good atmosphere and freedom for developer to use late technology to do their job
- learning new stuff_Learning
con : incredibly arrogant , highly political , " Old boy " network_Boys .
Culture be highly corrupt and underhanded .
<S-ORG> be the most corrupt company in the business_software business_software .
a incredible amount of customer be in " escalation " in other word they have fail implementation on their hand .
the products_legacy <S-ORG> product take <S-DATE> <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> to implement - and they still do work as describe in the demo .
the interface_user interface_user be something out of the <S-DATE> .
if you come in from the outside and question the quo_status quo_status , you be label a malcontent .
<S-ORG> Executive be shuffle from job to job within <B-FAC> <E-FAC> as part of the " old boy club_boys " .
it be a very hostile environment_work environment_work for woman and minority .
advice : employees_Survey current employee and former employee who have join the company over <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> in senior position and have subsequently leave .
<B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of that employee currently at the senior vp and <B-ORG> <E-ORG> level_VP in the <S-GPE> do not have any idea how to run the business that they be assign to .
they cultivate a hostile and abusive environment to attempt to mask their limitation .
most of this resource need to be let go , and most will have trouble find future employment .... they be that bad .
pro : <S-ORG> be a incredibly company_resource rich company_resource from a perspective_cash perspective_cash .
the pay be great and the benefit be top of the line
con :
with so much content available to leverage , they need a improve internal mechanism_search mechanism_search .
they do have one , and it effective , but it could be good , perhaps leverage more filter and attribute .... give how much content there be .
this be the only think I can think of , and it picking_nit pick .
advice : please do follow through on make employees_travel employee accommodate until such a time as a effective immunization_covid <S-CARDINAL> immunization_covid be widely distribute to the mass .
pro : value employee , their need , opinion , safety , growth_career growth_career , need , life_family life_family balance_life .
great benefit .
good compensation .
incredible on - program_boarding program_boarding .
great communication both from upper management
and immediate management .
overall , I be blow away .
<B-DATE> <E-DATE> wise , again the company have safety_employee safety_employee at heart .
for that with high risk , I believe they will work with employee who have requirements_travel requirement , in order to stay safe until immunization exist .
very impressive .
the amount of content available to knowledge_employee border on overwhelming , there be so much available to educate , prepare and enrich knowledge_employee knowledge_employee .
they even have formal program for find mentor , coach and interactions_peer interaction .
I could go on and on .
great company .
con :
once you join in a position and most importantly range_salary range_salary , it be significantly tough to make range_salary jump as oppose when you join externally .
guess this be the side_flip side_flip of the coin , where hierarchy be rather flat so there be limited opportunity for growth in the classical carreer_management carreer_management path_carreer , even though <S-ORG> offer pathes_expert carreer_management pathes_expert and management_project carreer_management carreer_management pathes_expert to compensate for this .
outside recognition of that title though be awkward for interaction with customer .
it be a very much consensus drive company which at time hinder fast paced innovation , create internal competition rather than the good possible synergetic approach advice : draft internal talent_Draft more effectively pro :
you can really make thing happen here .
rather flat hierarchy , very globally orient company with load of very smart person .
senior management be very accessible and it be a very stable employer who really protect their employee .
give the international setup there be a lot of opportunity to travel , work in intercultural setup , work accross different zones_time zone and interaction between employee be very informal .
flexible time_work time_work agreement , generous packages_vacation package even in the <S-GPE> , possibility to explore different pathes_carreer pathes_carreer .
it be the leader in applications_business application and tend to make the right decision .
con : I be with <S-ORG> prior to the <S-ORG> acquisition_SAP .
this be the <B-ORG> <E-ORG> office_Sybase and we be " the center of the universe " as far as the company be concerned .
<S-ORG> be headquarter in <S-GPE> so we be now on the very edge of the universe as far as the company be concerned and it be very difficult to get put on any meaningful project .
the company be also go through a major change in that they move more to the cloud which mean less staff_IT staff_IT be need .
the combination of this <S-CARDINAL> scenario cause our entire <S-CARDINAL> team_man team_man to be terminate after <S-CARDINAL> or <S-CARDINAL> ear of work at <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> .
advice : when <S-ORG> acquire <S-ORG> we be tell by upper <S-ORG> management_SAP that they do not acquire company and terminate many employee like <S-ORG> do .
they do it any way .
advice ... get all of your skilled resource involve in meaningful work ASAP after acquisition .
pro :
there be a lot of very talented person that work in the <S-GPE> , <S-GPE> office_Dublin .
pay be good and there be opportunity to learn different skill ... <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> and front tools_end tool in my case .
con : it be to bad that if you do fall into the right click you be a outsider ... the <B-ORG> <E-ORG> staff_Exec have too much power ... so you pray that they like you if not your life will be a hell_living hell_living .
it could be a great company and great to work for if they only treat and respect everyone .
get a rasie be a joke .... but as long as upper managmenet get their <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> then life be good
since you have to spend so much time at your work ... it should be a some what pleasent experience ... and yes you will have bump along the way ... but .. this road be not even paved
I could go on and on ... but what be the point .. it well never change ... they big dog be make big <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> on the back of the everday employee ....
advice : all I can say be you need to treat all your employee like you like to be treat ... and stop with all the lie ... about more <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> and promotion ... that will never happen unless you like they or they fit into the click .... one day you will know what this feel like .... it will come around soon or late that I know pro :
it have a lot of potential to learn a lot regard the software
con : Travel become impossible when my dad get sick .
as a result of my stress , I also become ill .
no support to reduce level of travel require to help I help my parent .
I leave because work / balance become impossible in my situation .
not sure if they could have do anything - would require rework of structure_communication structure_communication between manager and <S-ORG> .
I could not find a non-travel position that would allow I to stay in the company and do have a contact that I remember to ask in HR about it .
advice : would love to return to <S-ORG> , but would need a position with little travel while I be care for my mom .
not sure if they would have I back because of my situation .
dig deep into way to manage balance_work / life balance_work to keep person from leave .
pro : great knowledgeable colleague .
really nice person to work with .
very professional .
also considerate of needs_customer need .
Always strive to enable their person to be their good .
great training_self training_self available .
good benefit .
take good care of consultant .
I have always be very impressed and pleased with <B-PERSON> <E-PERSON> leadership .
also , his admin always respond to email from employee .
con : focus on <S-DATE> number be too short sight .
be in sale leadership_sales have become a horrible place to be .
we be suppose to " lead and inspire " our person but be give nothing to do so .
wake up ... good leader be leave every day .
management pay_Management be not compelling ( as if your whole team be not produce you be unlikely to hit bonus ) .
even if you do they might apply a factor_funding factor_funding to find a way not to pay you .
advice : <S-ORG> still can be a great place but the foundation of what make it great ( employee and customer <S-ORDINAL> ) with profit a close second be rot away .
also need more options_career option for <S-ORG> leadership_Sales .
this position grind good leader down after a certain period_time period_time ( due to culture mention above ) .
<S-ORG> be a complex place and experienced leader be hard to find .
do let they walk out the door ...
pro : good company with a nice portfolio_product portfolio_product .
if they stay focus on employee and customer and not just the " <S-DATE> number " they have a chance to continue to grow and stay a viable company .
good benefit .
if in the right group , good person .
con :
it a large <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> company_software company_software and that come with headaches_legacy headache ; change be happen but it do happen overnight .
advice : continue to bet on markets_growth market like healthcare but that also mean adapt to new models_business model for pricing and partnering .
streamline the offerings_product offering and focus on what we be great at .
let not try to build everything just because we can or at least think we can .
let work to adjust the cultural to the glass be always <S-CARDINAL> full mindset .
I find that there be a lot of folk that try to tell I why not to do something or why something can be do or why we should focus on this deal over another deal because of so and so reason .
in a environment_start - up environment_start , folk run hard and hit all sort of wall and learn from failure .
we need to encourage run simple , run hard , and it ok to fail but fail fast kind of attitude in our workforce , at least in my humble opinion .
pro : I be around smart person try to solve real issue .
the organization be not catch up in the pieces_fluff piece .
con : - work outside of the main office in <S-GPE> can feel like be a <S-ORDINAL> citizen_class citizen_class at time , where we be shut out from making_decision making_decision and give less interesting work to do
- there be a trend in the company to build open plan_floor plan_floor office without even walls_cubicle wall .
developer be largely introvert work on task that require total concentration for <S-TIME> at a time .
it should be obvious that the open plan_floor plan_floor be a disaster for this kind of employee .
it hard to estimate precisely , but my productivity have drop to probably <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of what it be in a cubicle .
imagine the overall impact on morale_employee morale_employee , as well as the bottom line when you need to hire <S-CARDINAL> person to do <S-CARDINAL> person job in this kind of environment .
advice : stop build new open plan_floor plan_floor office for developer .
convert the exist one back to cubicle .
good yet , give each scrum team their own large office that they can customize to their need .
please !
pro : - <S-ORG> treat its employee like human being , not like battery to be drain
- lot of opportunity for training and advancement
- good quality of life and relatively low stress
con :
no real structure or discipline in how thing be do .
so when result be not meet , there would be a reorganization , usually <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
we be a acquisition so after <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> in this reorganization they systematically move out the person who know about the business and bring in the <S-ORG> lifer .
then they move everyone under they on and bring in their buddy .
the new senior manager would make arbitrary decision on who the manager under they should be .
it happen <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> time in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
the person work for the manager be way more qualified for the job , but not <S-CARDINAL> of that position be ever advertise .
the style_management style_management be abusive , highly political , and no interest in develop employee .
advice : invest in educate employee on what the sell model_selling be .
leave the manager in place long enough to be able to evaluate talent .
develop leader properly and teach they to operate to the company value .
manage change correctly .
pro : pay be excellent , benefit be good , flexibility in work remotely , good ceo .
have <S-CARDINAL> boss in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
con : training and mentoring have always be mention for growth , but most the time it be a learn as you go .
this make you a follower , as you end up ' follow the other ' and make it more difficult to be a true leader .
advice : <S-ORDINAL> thank you for the opportunity to work for a great company , I truly do enjoy work at <S-ORG> !
if I have to provide a request for improvement , get the program_mentoring program_mentoring more open and available .
I love the fact <S-ORG> have spend so much with program_mentoring woman and grow their skill , but there be still man who be capable and would like to see a diverse program_mentoring program_mentoring that can really elevate the company to the next level !
pro : I be a senior lead Engineer_Software engineer for the <S-ORG> team_EIM for the <S-ORG> component_Server of <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> and <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> product .
I have the opportunity to train and mentor junior engineer to help increase their set_skill set_skill .
<S-ORG> also have some of the good packages_benefit package I have see , sure we could always ask for more but that would be trivial item and not really need .
con : <S-ORG> be big , and move slow .
change be manage by huge team , with a emphasis on ' manage ' , not get it do .
at least in the <S-GPE> , <S-ORG> embrace the mentality_hire / fire mentality_hire : if a members_team become obsolete in the eye of a <S-ORG> , there no support for individual members_team member to find alternative position within the company : no matter how experienced , talented and skilled this person be , how long they have be with the company .
no check_sanity check_sanity by <S-ORG> .
as a result , loyalty be heavily affect , especially among the young generation .
advice : take care of your talent .
pro : <S-ORG> be big , and will stick around .
much depend on the manager : do she / he take care of the members_team member , or strictly manage up for own goals_career goal .
I have experience both , and if you be lucky , this will be a great company to work for .
the company willingness to move to cloud be there , with considerable investment to implement change : which be amazing to observe and be part of .
in general , the <S-GPE> office be good facility to work , work from home be mostly not a issue .
con :
there be many break because of the nature of the high industry_tech industry_tech and our competitive posture .
there be also not many woman in high tech , so for I ( a woman ) , it hard to progress to high level of the organization .
also , sometimes because of the rapid pace of delivery , the left hand and the right hand do realize that they be work at odd or redundantly .
that a peeve_pet peeve_pet of mine .
advice : keep work on the woman in management initiative_women , but go deep in the topic .
you need woman on the board and in senior management who think differently to the man so that you get the value of diverse thinking in <S-ORG> strategy_SAP .
if you only keep person who think like man , you lose the benefit .
pro : <S-ORG> be a great place to work .
the strategy be clear and it work .
the company focus on make it customer , partner and employee successful .
the person be top notch .
for my role , there be a lot of flexibility to be able to determine how , where and when I work .
I feel like I can make a positive difference in the world work for <S-ORG> .
con :
this be a company_Software company_Software that be focus only on sales_license sale ... even though it pull in more revenue from <S-ORG> .
the " HQ_mothership " <B-ORG> <E-ORG> in <S-GPE> try to push <S-NORP> value and practices_work practice on employee .
advice : when everyone be in charge , no one be in charge .
too many inexperienced young person who all have different boss .
this allow this overpriced wonderkund to pursue their personal agenda and not focus on get the company into the <B-ORG> <E-ORG> market_Services that it need to be in to compete .
also , it time to " honestly " develop " trusted relationships_Agent " relationship with customer and move away from pure <B-ORG> <E-ORG> .
sale force_Sales have to be restructure to support the <B-ORG> <E-ORG> market_Services .
btw , your customer base_Customer do really want <S-ORG> , particularly 4_S / 4_S , because they do want to pay your high fees_license fee and do a complete re-implementation .
fix your product !
mean s/4 HANA_S/4 !
pro : name recognition_Name when deal with professional .
decent benefit .
decent attempt to create <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> balance_Work for employee .
they treat you as a adult when you attend events_industry event and submit expenses_travel expense .
Always willing to support training .
con :
there be <S-CARDINAL> areas_challenge area that I find , and neither be insurmountable .
<S-ORDINAL> , it a huge organization , so learn my way around " the matrix " take time .
fortunately , I be give ample time to ramp up in my role , so although daunting , the matrix can be conquer .
advice : keep it up !
<S-PERSON> create a great organization and culture at <S-ORG> .
pro : I never work for another company that value their employee the way <S-ORG> do .
the culture be welcoming , supportive , and collaborative , and the calibre of brainpower and talent at <S-ORG> exceed any other organization I know .
there be numerous paths_succession path ( which I have be encourage to explore ) , and <S-ORG> truly support progression_career progression_career .
<S-ORG> also place enormous value on humanistic value , and lead initiative - both internal and external - to promote diversity , equality , and education both in their own workforce and around the globe .
additionally , <S-ORG> encourage innovation across the business , regardless of role - there be no " bad idea " and all be encourage to try new way of do thing .
I love my job , my team and the company .
con :
can be hard to transfer internally due to freezes_hiring freeze
too many decision ( hire , give away ticket to <B-ORG> <E-ORG> ) be make base on who you know
technology lag in some area , <S-ORG> tend to be very slow to innovate
slow move in general
very bureaucratic with layer of management and multiple team do overlapping work
management can be arrogant - twice my team have be reorganize with new management over <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> and both time the new <B-ORG> <E-ORG> come in and totally trash anything and everything we have do previously ( ah , not very motivate ! )
advice : we often hear the company can afford it - whether that mean a request_travel request_travel or investment in a need area_product area_product .
make some tough decision on old product and cut out the many , many layer of stuff we don 'ot need ( internal communication , newsletter , special sites_web site , etc. ) and spend money where you need to !
pro :
if you need to make your own schedule this be a awesome place to work
<S-ORG> compensate individual contributor well - you can make good money without have to manage a team
free , healthy lunch in multiple cafe on <B-GPE> <E-GPE> campus_Palo
con :
if compare to other campuse like <S-ORG> , <B-ORG> <E-ORG> , the facility seem old .
Limited opportunities_career opportunity for young and old .
too much focus on savings_cost savings_cost .
volunteer matching_Volunteer program_matching get remove .
long employees_time employee be get afraid of pay the bill for Germany protection_employment protection_employment law .
still too much control from headquarter in <S-GPE> .
advice : allow to hire young person .
upgrade the campus_Ware in <B-GPE> <E-GPE> ( all building , not only <B-LOC> <E-LOC> ) look at the new <B-FAC> <E-FAC> campus_Ware across the street in <B-GPE> <E-GPE> with shops_coffee shop etc. .
we still have middle manager who should not be there .
some long time very skilled employee get frustrated by hit a ceiling_glass ceiling_glass both career and salary wise .
management should think of alternative benefit to attract young and old .
for example : college assistant_College program_assistant ( for newly grad to pay back the debt , for the old to save for their child ) .
additional option to save for retirement .
job rotation_Job program_rotation for new grads_college grad .
good dental insurance for the old employee .
pro : overall good environment_work environment_work .
flexible hours_work hour .
great spirit_team spirit_team when in front of a customer .
great product , <S-ORG> be change the industry .
con : lo pay .
do match <S-CARDINAL> .
and after a while you realize management do care about you really , which become even more prevalent with the <S-ORG> acquisition_SAP .
nobody know what go on there after the purchase .
nobody know if they go to hire <S-CARDINAL> more person , fire <S-CARDINAL> use arbitrary rule that be institute after the acquisition rather than give severance and down size , or really anything .
I mean some person do even know what their official title be anymore .
also there this really passive aggressive war between <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> , which just stifle collaboration and fix the stuff that wrong .
advice : I do .
reevaluate your life and decide if you want to be corporate bureaucrat for a giant <S-NORP> company who ceo have a quote from <S-PERSON> on the back of his biography_ghost write biography_ghost ?
or , like , treat person good ?
maybe try not institute rule , then drop they , then add new one seemingly monthly ?
maybe do have manager passive aggressively fight over person who have be promote or move to a different department .
pro : free drink .
very casual .
promote from within generally .
con :
as I say , it a fast - paced environment !
on the <S-ORG> side_Cloud of the business , we have <S-DATE> releases_product release .
I a developer_trainer / course developer_trainer and must be super - efficient when learn the new feature and roll - out update to my course <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
sometimes it do get stressful .
advice : I appreciate that the <S-ORG> leadership_SAP keep the company focus on edge_cutting - edge_cutting technology_edge and solution that our customer need ( even if they do yet know they need it ! )
in a company with <B-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> employee , it nearly impossible to get the right information to the right person in a timely way , but <S-ORG> do a pretty darn good job .

my role be stimulate and fulfil , and I get to work with a smart team and supportive manager .
I work from home , and have flexibility in my schedule .
it a fast - paced environment , which I thrive on .
I be very pleased with my salary and benefit and equipment .

I feel lucky to be part of this organization .
con : Concur culture be go away since the acquisition with <S-ORG> .
they be lay off or get rid of role to well align with <S-ORG> , but the amazing concur person that have be the
e for <S-DATE> no long have job and be be tell to go find something else ( write on behalf of what I be see and not my own experience ) .
my guess be that there will be a influx of people_Concur person that leave in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> if they have leave already .
Territory be get small , quota be go up but yet pay have change .
advice : really listen and pay attention to the <S-ORG> employee that have be there for <S-DATE> and make sure to hold onto some of the culture that <S-PERSON> start with .
consider revamp the grids_pay grid as quota continue to increase .
make sure when you be go to have a opening_job opening_job ... give everyone a opportunity to interview before make a decision .
I have see several person get promote or move into other role that pretty much receive the role before the role be announce .
pro : - person still love to use <S-PERSON>
- the mobile app be amazing
- concur be the forefront for <S-ORG> solutions_cloud solution
con : constant and annoying reorganization .
promote from within , and unfair / biased treatment towards that who be very attractive and ( usually ) female .
some upper management and vp have such a over - inflate ego , and nothing seem to be do about it when it be painfully obvious to so many person .
there be definitely a upper echelon of management here who be in effect a " inside ring " of some corruption and although they try to pride themselves on transparency the truth be that they be anything but .
also a extreme amount of outsource / contracting to <S-GPE> , which make it much more difficult to work productively on a local team .
advice :
there be some serious work that need to be do to make this company competitive and forward - think for it to survive the onslaught from <S-ORG> and other .
stop outsource to <S-GPE> .
pro : <S-ORG> be a good place to work in term of the environment_workplace environment_workplace .
many perk , like a gym , cafeteria , and a nice campus .
they treat employee relatively well .
good salary and benefit , especially compare to other my age .
good philanthropic effort .
con :
if you be a experienced sales_consulting sale rep_sales and consider a job with <B-ORG> <E-ORG> , I give you this advice : <B-ORG> <E-ORG> be quickly turn into a <S-ORG> group_SUPPORT .
it capability , offerings_service offering and resource have be decimate to the point where you will just sell <S-ORG> offerings_service .
( ask about " <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> or about the number of consultant employ year over year during your interview and listen carefully to the answer . )
despite what they tell you , the job be not a true <S-ORG> role_Sales .
you mostly be a flunky of the reps_license rep who will favor external partner .
your management will be powerless to support you , but will hold you accountable for their fail strategy .
most of they have never be front people_line sale person .
many of they be buddy from past job at other company .
key to success :
if you you be a shameless promoting_self - promote sycophant , you do well here .
your main sale will be to promote yourself to clueless management who assign account base on how much you kiss up to they .
account assignment will make or break you .
<B-DATE> <E-DATE> ( <S-DATE> ) approx <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of the <S-ORG> rep make their quota .

there be clearly a lack of direction and I be afraid we be run of the rail .
we lose skillful expert through various cutting_cost cutting_cost measure for bad executive decision in different wave .
unless there be some serious introspection and correction_course correction_course ... I do see our company continue to be a force in the space_enterprise space_business space_enterprise beyond <S-DATE> !
advice : we need to build good software that offer complete functions_business function with incremental change that be innovative .
unfortunately , we be too catch up in be innovative and broaden the breath of our solution that we be lose sight of what make we a successful company !
maybe it time that we bring a engineer up the organization to fix this mess before it too late pro :
nice place to learn what you should never do if you have a chance to run a company .
there be ton of constantly evolve initiative to follow the curves_hype curve and few very experienced and skillful person mostly in <S-GPE> from whom you can learn a lot !
con :
your experience will vary base on the department for which you work .
some be very well manage and employees_value employee , give they freedom to implement new idea while maintain consistent goal and appropriate direction .
other be very poorly manage , seemingly provide misdirection to their worker and make every task much more difficult then it need be .
there be also the issue of internal politics .
<S-PERSON> take on a role_management role_management unless you be ready to spend <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of your time play this game .
advice : more entrepreneurial spirit , few blocks_road block .
set annual goal at a more granular level so that employee know what be expect .

I be at <B-ORG> <E-ORG> for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> now .
I would hesitate to recommend a member_family member_family or friend for a job here .
the <S-ORG> role_MDR itself be a challenging role_MDR , one that require a thick skin and the ability to not get rattle by the inevitable " nos " that come with the territory .
be a successful <S-ORG> have ability to set you up for the next step in your professional career .

if you want the balance_work / life balance_work most of we do that fine .... just be prepare to party with the key folks_management folk <S-DATE> or you will be on the outside look in due to the high level of politics_office politics_office .
product be very expensive and many often wonder it they be worth it .
many company have spend <S-CARDINAL> on <S-ORG> software_SAP ; have they receive the roi / benefit promise ?
perhaps some have but many have not .
many other choice out there with similar functionality for a fraction if the cost .
shop around !!!
and if your company somehow get out of compliance_software with the term of your agreement the <S-ORG> compliance_software compliance_software police_SAP will be out to get you <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .

<S-ORG> also promote life_work - life_work balance_life .
the company global nature create a environment where your product_work product_work speak for itself , not the hour of time_face time_face you put in at the office .
accordingly , most employee can easily work without any negative consequence or judgement .
this be great for work parent and other employee who value the flexibility to create their own schedule .
con : <S-CARDINAL> . SAP vary the benefit it offer its employee base on geography .
employee in the <S-GPE> , for example , get significantly less pay parental leave than that in <S-LOC> .
ex .
in <S-LOC> , the * minimum* a new mother can take be <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , and she can take up to <S-CARDINAL> .
in the <S-GPE> , the * maximum* be <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
for a company that talk a lot about take care of its employee , it seem somewhat hypocritical to treat they all differently , work within the minimum guideline lay down by law .
<S-CARDINAL> Internal raise and increases_salary increase be fairly stagnant .
practically the only way to get a significant raise within <S-ORG> be to get a new job in a different department .
this be awful , because then that with much high expertise and knowledge_product knowledge_product just ... leave .
regular actual raise for increase expertise and knowledge_product knowledge_product would save <S-ORG> a fortune in newbies_hiring and training newby , as well as improve morale_employee morale_employee and help retain good worker .

management do whatever it think good without ask employee
management be try to do more with less employee and work - balance_life balance_life suffer
management jerk team around .
they give you a project then transfer it away then assign another and then transfer it away .
that do wonder for morale .
everything move very slowly .
adoption of new technology and methodology be <S-DATE> behind .
advice : get the org_engineering org_engineering to catalog exist functionality .
it be good when a group be <S-ORG> a competitor solution_competitors when there be a in one_house one_house they do even know exist .
address morale_Address problem
move organization toward quick adoption_technology adoption_technology and allow time for innovation_employee innovation_employee .
pro : lot of friendly and competent person to work with
there be some interesting technical problem to solve ( if you can get on one of that project )
the benefit be good .
con : Organic innovation be very slow , unless it come down_top - down_top from <S-ORG> or the board .
executive member_board be largely organize functionally ( vs. <S-ORG> ) tailor to member_board member_board ability , not suitable for a company this side .
great idea from the bottom - up_bottoms almost impossible to realize , even that that get early traction in the market .
most new revenue be through <S-ORG> .
highly matrixed organization , especially <S-ORG> .
General manager close to the market have little influence on direction_product direction_product and priority .
development ( except acquire business ) mostly centralized or influence from <S-GPE> and be often out of touch with the market .
many " I
too " product that be late to market , many wasteful use of resources_development resource not assign to product .
advice : you be too big for a functional structure at the level_board level_board .
you need empower BUs that have key function as part of they and can act with agility .
implement " Simple_Run simple " by simplify your structures_organization structure .
actively ( not just service_lip service_lip ) support more bottom - up innovation_bottoms .
pro : large global company , exposure to wide_world wide_world business , culture .
visibility to broad trends_industry trend .
loyal erp customer .
con : <S-CARDINAL> . this place live on <S-WORK_OF_ART> to create vaporware and good_feel - good_feel reports_status report .
they rarely spend time with customer , just consultants_management consultant and their own internal belief .
status report be always biased towards " green light " as they move up the chain_management chain_management .
<S-CARDINAL> be in a role_staff role_staff report into a group in <S-GPE> .
it be too easy to become detached and forget .
and all thing " invent in <S-GPE> " be deem good .
advice : <S-CARDINAL> . stop listen to mid-level manager provide you " strategy " and " guidance " .
<S-CARDINAL> measure management_Measure on produce real result that customer ( & partner ) care about .
<S-CARDINAL> pay attention to what the competition have already achieve , versus the grandiose plan mid-level management recommend .
pro : <S-CARDINAL> . previously , because it be easy to develop yourself by move to a new role within the company ; that be currently severely restrict .
<S-CARDINAL> . they care about their employee ...
let see how they adhere to this in <S-DATE> .
<S-CARDINAL> . the pay be generous give the low workload .
con :
there be a lot of changes_leadership change go on constantly , which be both good and bad .
good if you in sale or building_product building_product since you can climb the ladder .
bad because it create a lot of confusion on the team do actual work , and definitely make it hard to be strategic .
advice : <S-ORG> really need to adopt a culture_cloud culture_software culture_cloud quickly where the loops_feedback loop from voice of customer to releases_production release be cycle on scales_time scale of <S-DATE> , not <S-DATE> .
the competition be stiff with top native_cloud - native_cloud vendors_enterprise vendor offer more integrate portfolio of product .
<S-ORG> need to accelerate to maintain a position of strength .
pro :
this be <S-CARDINAL> of the premier organization when it come to software_enterprise software_enterprise sale execution_sales .
I join <S-ORG> from a management_startup management_software management_product management_startup and development_business development_business background_management specifically to learn and become <S-ORG> at scale , and become part of a based_team - base sell culture_selling that execute deal at scale across all industry .
there be many role for one to learn and play .
the work_culture work_culture - balance_life balance_life , and benefit be amazing .
con :
as time go on , the <S-NORP> corporate greed really start show its ugly face to the employee .
while the financial growth of the company be in double digit <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , the benefits_employee benefit swiftly go down from good to neutral to poor .
the Level_C - level bonus go up and so be the incompetence and cronyism .
though the company preach training , improvement_self improvement_self , time_family time_family etc. for well round life , it be never practice .
your time_training time_training will not be count for productivity and so be your vacation .
as a employee to get good bonus you almost have to kill yourself work .
<S-CARDINAL> of the big con be the calculations_bonus calculation .
you be never tell how your bonus be calculate .
advice : the middle and upper management should be open in announce their salary and bonus and let the bonuses_employee know the formula for bonuses_employee bonus .
pro :
when I start <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , it still have the <S-NORP> impact and the benefits_employee benefit be very good .
the <S-ORG> platform_application platform_SAP still be still a very good product .
con : -
at time the sale floor_sales could be gossipy and feel like high school all over again
- the competition be cheap and at this point probably as good of a product if not good
- once <S-ORG> take over , key leader leave , some whom make a huge impact on the culture
- Territory can be good or very bad

be open and honest with the sale team_sales and collaborate with they versus give directive and unreasonable ultimatum .
just because a employee have be in the company for a a long time ... do not qualify they for a role_management role_management .
use your <S-CARDINAL> tool and cross-referencing what the peer say about they , would be a great way to find this out .

con : Glacial cycles_development cycle drive by <S-GPE> ( <S-NORP> HQ ) mean that it difficult to make any sort of impact .
<S-ORG> do not understand how to really manage innovation and how to do thing quickly .
also , there be lot of dead wood here - the person that actually make thing happen either become executive ( in a few case ) or leave to go somewhere where it easy to actually do something ( most case ) .
advice : Figure out how to innovate more quickly ; your vision be muddle by too much complexity .
look no further than decks_SAP decks_slide deck for a symptom of your problem - they be wordy than a lot of novel .
if you can articulate issue succinctly , it show a lack of clarity in your thinking .

con :
our team , and therefore job , be constantly change due to overhaul in high - up management and their idea of improvement , which be execute without too much thorough research into the exist work we be do .
it often feel like we have to start over with initiative and idea we already have in the work , only to never convince makers_decision maker that they be truly worthwhile .
sort of lead we to feel behind , compare to the rest of the specific industry we be work in .
advice : get to know the various team under your management well and investigate the incredible work they be do before you rearrange and eliminate .
otherwise , competitive edge feel like it could dwindle .
pro : supportive and casual environment_work environment_work , at least in my location .
flexible hour and leave to mostly manage_self - manage_self ( though I sure this depend on your team ) , which really give I the freedom and peace of mind to work out my own rhythm and flow for good output_quality output_quality .
con :
there be time when great idea be be patent but at the end of the day be not be reduce into practice ( implement ) , maybe due to lack of resource and / or difference in the r&amp ; D priority , and / or maybe due to over focus .
advice : when steering our big ship in today rough water , besides the need to continue to innovate and use new technology for our customer , we should allocate more effort into the systems_Eco system on a global scale .
engage with big and small ship so as to create a armada , to enjoy and gain from the power of the combination , since the dissemination and absorption of knowledge be one of the key to long sailing_distance sailing_distance .
pro : diversity , inclusion , and respect for other .
the culture of share idea .
the drive to make the company strategy a reality for our customer .
make our customer run simple be not just a slogan , it be carve in our working spirit , it be part of our DNA_company DNA_company , because we care !

political coup and hijacking of project be common occurrence .
product be create by engineering , then sell as something else by a perpetually disconnect sale and marketing army_sales , and suddenly a solidly engineer technology need to be hack into whatever it get position as for customer .
HR in the <S-GPE> have be completely outsource to offshore centers_call center , and thing like compensation for pay leave , reimbursement for expense , and help with problem with the insurance_health insurance_health provider_insurance can take <S-DATE> to resolve .
advice : Priority_# <S-CARDINAL> priority - hire a real human resource department_resources , with on - reps_site rep available to employee in all major location .
Fire whoever come up with the idea of outsource HR .
pro : a surprisingly large number of very intelligent engineer , some very interesting technology , and a fair amount of freedom and flexibility .
<B-GPE> <E-GPE> campus_Alto be very pleasant , with open space , decent cafeteria , a nice little garden ... there be a center_fitness center_fitness , but it a bit inadequate .
con :
there really not any major con I can think of .
the only one would probably be that there need to be more unified communication across all department .
also , sometimes it hard to find answer to issue that be technical in nature if no one I typically communicate with have ever come across that same issue .
it can feel like your left in the dark for a bit until you can finally find a answer after multiple avenue .
this can impact your time_clients and the client time_clients .

I also see such a strong commitment to the community - broadly through our next gen center_Gen , adoption of <S-ORG> principle , and locally through involvement here .
there be also lot of encouragement and opportunity for training and expand skill or learn new one .
con : - salary might not be as comparable to the other giants_tech giant but I prefer a good healthy environment_work environment_work with good benefits_employee benefit than look for a high pay company_paying where benefits_employee be just treat like resource that they need to milk to Advice_exhaustion advice : none pro : - I have be with <S-ORG> for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> and I love it !
I have not be bored or feel stagnate in my growth till now !

most person bog down with fixing_bug fixing_bug and management_test management_test listen to the <S-ORG> , <S-ORG> , <S-ORG> propaganda_HANA rather than explore and implement science_computer science_computer paper .
there be not a lot of visible opportunities_growth opportunity for the young person that come into former <S-ORG> .
indeed most of the person be here for <S-DATE> do the same or almost the same thing .

you have to be unlucky to fall in this group - unfortunately it do exist and there be no escape if you be trap there .

<S-ORG> be a highly competitive rotational program and accelerator_career accelerator_career within the product a
would organization_innovation organization_d at <S-ORG> .
the cool thing be that you can rotate on multiple <S-ORG> team within <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
at the end you may select the good fit base on mutually benefit .
therefore , you may develop a big mindset_picture mindset_picture about <S-ORG> , while contribute your strength on many impactful features_product feature that be use by the world most successful business .
I think this unique program would be the good choice for all new graduate to consider .
- application process :
the review below be base on overall process_recruiting process_recruiting of <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> .
the whole process take <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> ( start from the time that my resume be accept and I submit the form_survey form_survey ) .
the recruiter be pretty helpful and responsive with arrangements_interview arrangement as well as updates_status update .
the process_interview process_interview have several round .
the <S-ORDINAL> round be talk your background with the recruiter .
I learn about the process_recruiting process_recruiting and what to expect after join <S-ORG> program_SVNT .
after that the <S-ORDINAL> interview_round interview_round be with the <S-ORG> program_SVNT manager_program , in which many behavioral question be ask .
I enjoy the conversation a lot and find that the values_core value and culture_team culture_team at <S-ORG> would be the perfect fit for I .
I also feel connect with the manager_program manager_program when I share insight about my experience and lesson learn .
the <S-ORDINAL> and <S-ORDINAL> round be technical interview with <S-ORG> expert in my field .
the format and question be similar to typical technical interview with other large companies_tech company .
<S-CARDINAL> thing stand out be that all interviewer be super passionate about their work and share many great thing about work at <S-ORG> .
this conversation really help I to develop a good understanding about the benefit of <S-ORG> program_SVNT and I then decide to accept the offer from <S-ORG> instead of some other top company .
con : sale organization_Sales be still as cutthroat as any , shift culture in business_HCM business_HCM be not positive .
quota unrealisticall high in some lob , so that rep be not make quota at a rate that you would expect in a high business_growth business_growth .
high sg&a be not well understand , so attempt to reduce sg&a remain ineffective .
cut sale compensation_sales do not reduce <S-ORG> .
customer technical support_Customer be very poor and <S-ORG> have only take small step to improve it , without success .
it require a total overhaul .

cloud business_Cloud be grow very well .
sound technical strategy a dlong prospects_term prospect be very positive .
I maximmize purchases_stock purchase because I believe in the company .
it be fun to work with smart and motivate person who take pride in their work .
con :
not a lot of diversity at the level_director - level_director and up .
development be usually for skills_tech skill , but not much for management or mentoring .
do seem to be clear pathway to develop leadership for director , <S-ORG> etc. - especially for minority .
at level_director level_director , it very monochromatic or part of the <S-NORP> clique .
multiple executive come and go with the wind from acquisition .
the only stable thing be the <S-NORP> upper leadership .
advice : develop more track_management track_management for diversity .
pro :
if you have the right technical skill , <S-ORG> will give you the space to learn and grow .
it not this frenetic pace in other place where you must program x line of code or must deliver a program <S-CARDINAL> - test .
there the importance of need slack to get the work do .
sometimes overtime , but not too bad .
overall benefit be excellent .
may not be as progressive as <S-ORG> or <S-ORG> - but that place be crazy busy .
con : be part of the <S-ORG> acquisition_Ariba in <S-DATE> , and now in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> have be go through the planning_compensation planning_compensation for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
the company speak about their philosophy of be open and fair about compensation , but they try to hide all of their band and pay grade from <S-ORG> employee .
they do do this very well , and it now pretty widely know that the <S-ORG> employee be pay well below the <S-ORG> bands_salary band , but <S-ORG> have no plan to rectify this .

most customer be pay @ 90_net 90_net <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .

advice : recently , <S-ORG> announce that it would have achieve equality_pay equality_pay worldwide by <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
unfortunately , this be not true and there be lot of discrepancy .
I be manage a team where employee from <S-GPE> have high salary than their peer ( man and woman from other country base in <S-ORG> ) , even though they be execute the same function .
there be some case , where employee have high salary than manager and we be a commercial team , not technical .

when I decide to move on from <S-ORG> , management be very rude and leave a bad taste in my mouth .
advice : respect your employee .
do not treat they like ants_worker ant , they be person .
keep a open line of communication so you know how they do , not just update on their projects_work project .
our manager refuse to have regular <S-CARDINAL> - on - <S-CARDINAL> call and thing become overwhelming .

from a perspective_customer perspective_customer , many be frustrate due to lack of true integration between product and spanning_long span projects_implementation and service project .
advice : ensure that your program_diversity program_diversity be not just for show , but that woman be promote into the upper rank .
and streamline process to make it easy to get client the attention they need .
pro :

they have a program_diversity program_diversity for woman , specifically in leadership , which show the value the place on woman and program_diversity .
they strive to be innovative and to create a culture of engagement .
con :
it can be fast paced and sometimes stressful .

you might find somebody get <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> of experience and he only have a intern-level skillset .
#truestory - poor slow_communication - slow_communication - not a competitive pay - as a result : growth_lack growth_lack , personally and professionally advice :

upward mobility be much more likely if you base in <S-CARDINAL> of the major office where there be more high execs_level exec .
tendency to focus more heavily on the young generation - ageism_generations can be a thing .
advice : be open minded about who you look to hire or promote - there be great talent in some of your small location and also in person who have a long tenure at the company - do alienate the old generation just because you be keen to attract early talent .
pro : flexibility be great for most role - help if you have a busy personal / life_family life_family .
Global environment where person be genuinely respectful of different culture .
manager and employee be generally not afraid to share info or help their colleague learn and grow ( compare with other company where you might see intense territorialism or protectionism_job protectionism_job ) .
con : I be hesitant to share this but be encourage by other review of colleague who seem to have face similar experience with HR .
<B-ORG> <E-ORG> have a history of not support woman who be face harassment in the workplace .
they be slow to act and when they do they will ask the person who report the situation to make all the adjustment .
unless you escalate it , that accuse of harassment will face little penalty while that who experience it be make to feel guilty for even report it .

pro :
once you in , there good opportunity to navigate your career and switch to other area as your interest evolve and adapt .

something area like pricing be way over - engineer that they be punitive to work with .
product management life be development and releases_feature release have a tenancy to be hi-jack for the sake of technology , leave many product in a position_catch - up position_catch .
advice : move product management to customer success and staff accordingly .
make customer success be the customer of <S-ORG> and allow customer success to be the right arm of sale in the field for the product instead of lean into the development team .
pro : New leadership be much less " rah rah sales_go sale ! " like <S-PERSON> and <S-PERSON> and be more in touch with the workforce down .
I get more candidate and honest information from this team_leadership team_leadership than the previous and feel this team_management team_leadership be much more strategic in term of direction_company direction_company beyond make the number .
con : most of the job in service and sale require extensive travel .
long objectives_term objective be sometimes circumvent by the short objectives_term need_term to hit target or metric .
company have remarkably different corporate culture when compare the <S-GPE> and <S-GPE> and other subsidiary .
the <S-GPE> can be too focus on make the deal , <S-GPE> can be too focus on make the technology .
in the not too distant future we see what the army of <S-NORP> bring to the table .
advice : stop manage the quarter_company <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
the board do a very good job of look out <B-DATE> <E-DATE> and invest accordingly .
most of the layer of management below that be focus on <S-DATE> and <S-DATE> target .
pro : good product with a <B-PRODUCT> <I-PRODUCT> <E-PRODUCT> base_customer base_List .
<S-ORG> offer competitive remuneration with a approach_pay for performance approach_pay .
it be possible to advance rapidly .
Global mobility with <S-ORG> and in the large <S-ORG> ecosystem_SAP if very good .
con : - life_work - life_work balance_life can be tough , especially in global role where you have interact with zones_time zone
- even though company be grow , it be still cut back in certain area -- if you do get cut , you typically have to pick up the slack which can feel unmanageable at time advice : - when execute a reduction in force , clearly communicate the expectation of that leave standing as to how to manage exist workload and make sure that be realistic -- especially consider morale be already down with friend be force to leave pro : - great pay and benefit
- exciting vision for the future of technology
- reward for contribution as well as potential for contribution
- good offerings_training offering for <S-ORG> certification as well as allowance_education allowance_education
- laid back culture of autonomy and scheduling_self scheduling_self -- just get thing do and add value
con : recruiting have be know to lie -
there be countless example of person who be lie to about their title / level and their next move in company .
backwards title complicate this further .
this couple with much of my other feedback lead to great employee either leave the company , or leave and come back ( which the ceo , <S-ORG> , and many other leader have do ) .
when it come to hire your own team , person manager have to do the majority of search for candidate ( provide they want to assure they get the good person for the role ) .
most mid-level leader be afraid of and / or avoid confrontation - bad to mediocre employee be disciplined , and over - achiever
be reward commensurate of their impact .
I not sure anyone have ever be put on a plan_action plan_action ( let alone fire ) at the company , which make that that be ( below ) average at their job think that they just have to wait to be promote .
leader try to contain over - achiever by promise a bright future if they just wait , then offer you everything you want( ed ) when it too late .
senior leader lift up concern about employee , so do say manager person , and yet no action_material corrective action_material be take result in their great employee move on .
wrong or right , this give the perception that manager be more concerned with be everyone friend and be happy with where they be , so they state that " everyone here be great " to make thing easy versus have tough conversation or potentially ruffle feather by have some on a fast track than their peer .
top down style_management style_management - a lot of mid-level to senior leader do take constructive criticism well from their employee .
they get the majority of their direction from senior executive , then generally tailor to what their plan be , which delay or fracture promises_career promise ( move target ) .
they no doubt mean well , but do seem to realize that if they be authentic <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of the time , employee be still leave guess when the other <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> be occur ( and if they can truly rely on they for their good interest ) .
additionally , when you ask they why overall projections_company projection or a launch_product launch_product deadline_launch be miss , you tend to get boilerplate excuse .
seniority can breed complacence -
the most person I ever see in a company that have be there for the majority of their career .
that generally a good thing , but many of this person do have a competitive background for their position that one would expect from a <S-ORG> / leader in technology .
diversity ( include in professional experience ) be a good thing .
a lot of the leader that have be with the company for the majority of their career likely would be at the same level at any other comparable company , and many do go to school for what they be do .
perhaps they realize this , so they never leave , and be fine with mediocre employee on their team as it will challenge their position in company .
because many have work at other major company , they do know any good , generally give false positive review on their manager and for <S-ORG> as a good place to work .
Little to no value be give for have advanced degree ( nor do leader encourage their employee to pursue they ) as the company seem to think companies_consulting company and annual conference be the only thing need to help with going_on - go efforts_education effort .
advice : <S-ORG> should audit all <S-ORG> employee ( especially mid-level leader ) as overall it do appear they be get their money worth .
start with re-organize all of recruiting as that will make or break your pipeline_talent pipeline_talent .
stop restrict hiring to only internal candidate ( if you want to get to $ <S-MONEY> in revenue in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , that math do work ) .
it about as productive as give a transfusion_blood transfusion_blood to yourself .
stop tell employee in mass that " everyone be great . "
leader , hold your person accountable for not perform , not be good person manager , or miss deadline ( especially that that slip by <S-DATE> to a year ) .
you go to be successful in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> regardless of what you do .
the point be , you could be a lot more successful , while inspire your employee at all level to do their good work .
everyone heart be in the right place .
it about be comfortable enough as a leader to be critical of yourself , your person , and make sure you have the good person in all the right role .
you have the right framework .
you just need to be honest with yourself and want to change .
you get this !
you no doubt can realize the awesome you aspire to be .

my personal experience be that management give you the independence to do your job , but be there to support you when need .
the work itself be very fulfil and every day be a new adventure .
I tell everyone that they should life_work for a <S-NORP> company as the benefit and focus on life_work life_work balance_life be the good I ever have .
as a example , I have <B-DATE> <E-DATE> pay leave_maternity leave_maternity with the birth of my last child .
I currently at over <B-DATE> <E-DATE> of vacation .
I also a remote worker , work from home and the flexibility this afford be amazing and the only reason I remotely sane as a work mother of <S-CARDINAL> .
con :
like all large company , sometimes it a bit difficult to change direction of the ship .
change do get do , just sometimes slow than we would like to see .
also due to the size there be sometimes layer to get through to get something approve or get work do .
while <S-ORG> be work through this try to make everything more " simple " we still have a way to go .

person get promote , change department , or get fire and you almost never hear about it from management and when you do its way too late - everyone already know about it through the mill_rumor mill_rumor .
this be lead to a grow lack of confidence in management , especially in the face of the company be buy out .
<S-CARDINAL> fast - paced growth and acquisition by a giant corp_software corp_mega- corp_software be change the feel of the company overall - despite insistence from upper management to the contrary .
it not all bad - but it different and in combination with number <S-CARDINAL> lend itself to a sense of unease amongst employee .
tech start_Tech up do stay start_Tech up forever if they be do it right , so this change be to be expect .
advice : please put some serious focus on internal communication and development_employee development_employee ( automated security_internet security_internet training do not count ) .
the company be at a critical junction and if you want to continue develop dedicated and passionate employee you need to treat they as value resource .

there be a off_trade - off_trade in order to be a part of this organization .
" work hard , play hard " with emphasis more on set expectation high and high each individual productivity and output each year - without improve process in a meaningful way ...

- mature process , management and capability
con : pay be relatively less compare to the market and they do have great benefit in term on shares_bonus and company share .

there a new project to work on <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , so thing move at a fast pace .
good in a way because you do tend to get bored work on the same thing .
and there always lot to learn .
person in general be nice to work with and the company have reasonably flexible hour .
you be allow to work from home occasionally and there no code_dress code_dress .
situate in <S-GPE> <B-TIME> <E-TIME> away from <S-GPE> station_Wiehle and very close to the future stop_metro stop_metro .
the company have a lot go for it .
con : the <B-ORG> <E-ORG> team_Development have go through a coaster_roller coaster_roller of management in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
the current regime have cause a severe downturn in morale , productivity , and trust in the process , and unfortunately <S-ORG> as a whole .
the rest of the manager have a lot of potential , but be force to abide by upper management style_leadership style_leadership .
the major issue that I run into be that I constantly be be talk to like a child rather than a working professional .
a awesome pro of work for <S-PERSON> be their benefit include <B-DATE> <E-DATE> <S-ORG> , however if you take a vacation , and do not hit your goal ( which be astronomically high , while only increase ) you will be chastise .
in fact , some be ask " do you really think you should take that <S-ORG> over <S-DATE> with how your month be go ? "
the job itself be difficult enough , cold calling be difficult enough .
the job of leadership be to be selfless , to be a part of the grind , and to motivate person , rather than show up late , leave early , take constant <S-ORG> , but then belittling their employee when they want the same ( or similar ) freedom .
you will also need to be in seat for a minimum of <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , while attain the high quota consistently to be eligible for a promotion .
elsewhere in the organization it be base on merit and production for a promotion , however in <B-ORG> <E-ORG> the leadership ( primarily director ) be more worried about hit their own number , and how much you can help pad their pocket than your development_career development_career .
they will do whatever they can to keep the top performer on their team to help themselves , rather than help you progress in your career within Concur .
<S-CARDINAL> final con : at <S-ORG> , and now <B-ORG> <E-ORG> you be a part of a incredible organization that strive to change business and life of their employee as well as yours as a employee of <B-ORG> <E-ORG> .
in <B-ORG> <E-ORG> , you be tell not to attend the all hand meeting , the lunches_team lunches_celebration lunch , etc. because that time be well suit with you on the phone .

when I leave the morale of <B-FAC> <I-FAC> <E-FAC> floor_Development be at a all low_time low_time , and only sink further .
I would recommend for upper leadership to take a deep look at how the <S-ORG> be currently be train , coach , and how they be be compensate .
unfortunately when I leave , top performer be the unhappiest on the floor , because the light at the end of the tunnel be be force small and small pro : - Concur have unlimited opportunity for growth_career growth_career ( once out of market dev_Market . )
- the person you work with be fun , friendly , and you will want to hang out out with they outside of work

if you have work for the company for little long , there be view that you be not ready for new challenge .. your idea be stale .

I wish Upper talk_management talk_management to team other than director to get the view of the department .
I have see person quit the company and join back , to get a hike , promotion and to get to work on new technology .

they can hire <S-CARDINAL> employee in <S-GPE> to <S-CARDINAL> in <B-LOC> <E-LOC> .
advice : focus on quality , not quantity as your base_customer base_customer demand it ..
if not , in the long run you will be last in the cloud as customer see they can understand the other guy on the end of the phone ( because of their thick <S-NORP> accent ) and barely have enough experience to do the most simple task unless it spell out for they in a guide .

not sure if they be under pressure or what , but since <S-ORG> acquire <S-ORG> , some manager have a completely different attitude toward employee .
they would micro-manage person , watch how your sit in meeting , take note of every little thing that they never use to do .
in other word , they have essentially become some annoying managers_smart@ss manager .

con : <S-ORG> be a <S-NORP> company and so be not a perfect cultural fit for someone from the <S-GPE> with a liberal mindset .
the focus be on profit , and we be very good at it .
but I feel pressure to deliver in less time than be require , and believe that our customer be not always well - serve .
primarily , my message be that this on - company_premise company_premise be integrate aspect of a based_cloud - base company_premise ,
but kill off some of the benefit and joy of work for a environment_cloud environment_cloud .

like the industry , <S-ORG> be constantly evolve with the time and have come from <S-ORG> , to <B-ORG> <E-ORG> , to the <S-ORG> and now be a force in <B-ORG> <E-ORG> .
what have impress I the most be that <S-ORG> will invest and retrain its employee as oppose to go out find that new skill .
if you like learn new skill , this be the place for you .
con :
although the company talk about empowerment and unlearned hierarchy to self manage .
board mandate demonstrate a lack of trust in the same employee it want to empower .
advice : trust your employee .
provide guidance but do limit our ability to spend <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> to do what right for the employee especially under crazy time ( <S-WORK_OF_ART> ) .

con :
it be <S-CARDINAL> big shop and very focus on many industry .
this lead to issue that relate to the corporate direction and comm conflict with the specific vertical market issue .
take lot to balance this out by Advice_region advice : zero in on the reality of specific market and let the team that know the market lead the domination of say market .
the real oppty in high tech that many already figure out be to extend the brand and message vertically versus horizontal .
and to also drive the person on vertical sets_goal set ....
pro : solid corp that pay well and do care about their person .
<S-ORG> have grow very fast and no long produce the old software_SAP only software_SAP and service .
also strong team of smart person
con : <S-CARDINAL> . this be a traditional ' con ' - it about be aware that the culture be a fit for everyone .
if you like a high level of engagement with your manager and be give exact direction on what be expect of you , this be not likely the place for you * unless * you seek a quality management / quality assurance / test / tech support type_Support role_Management .
<S-ORG> be what I call a " entrepreneurial " company , that give employee a lot of latitude in how to shape their job and how to define their path_career path_career .
I love it , and I have the chance to try a lot of different role in my time here - but I have also see wonderful , talented , intelligent person become exceedingly frustrated .
e.g. , I may have a short biweekly call with my manager ( who be remote ) , and find that sufficient for discuss my project , but some person may feel the need to speak with their manager multiple time per week with their manager to get direction on certain problem , or talk through idea they have .
many manager be use to that type of ' constant loop_feedback loop_feedback ' of engagemnet - so I think it important to understand if you come to <S-ORG> , you go to be trust to make a lot of decision on your own , and you go to be expect by most manager to be able to do that .
I hear person complain that when they ask a manager " what should I do ? " the manager response be " what do you * think * you should do ? "
if that bother you , then you may not find <S-ORG> the good fit for your style_preference in management style_preference , or you should ensure when you interview , that you discuss your style_preference and expectation for the level of engagment from your manager .
<S-ORG> want person to be happy , but employee also have to be aware_self - aware_self to understand the corporate culture , in general , and decide if it a fit .
<S-CARDINAL> constant , continual organizational change .
sometimes <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , at least once per year .
change be common at all large business , but it do seem <S-ORG> move the pieces_puzzle piece around more often than peer .
<S-CARDINAL> . <S-CARDINAL> of the clear area that we see the origin of <S-ORG> as a <S-NORP> company found by engineer be the number of template - powerpoing and spreadshet - that be create , maintain , and mandate for person to use .
you may find process be ' over - engineer ' compare to other company , and that can be frustrating ... but it improve , and if fill out a spreadsheet be the bad thing you can say about your job , it really not bad at all !
advice : - continue to fight the over - engineering of process .
- ensure virtual team have <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> opportuity per year to come together to meet in person and build / maintain personal network .
- continue to promote exchanges_job exchange / fellowship to cross-pollinate skillset
- Roll out the excellent formal program_mentoring and coaching program_mentoring to the full base_employee base_employee
- send every employee to sapphire at least once per <B-DATE> <E-DATE> of employment - it the most amazing , invigorating , empowering experience to see <S-ORG> from the outside , the way our customer see we ... it never fail to re-energize employee and be a chance to hear <S-ORDINAL> - hand from customer , which many person never get to do in internal role .
- keep push the boundary - at <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , it astonish how well we avoid the pitfall that have do in much young companies_IT company , and that directly related to the <S-ORG> and ceo vision_Board and leadership .
pro : I work in multiple role over a decade in different location - it amazing to be able to have a widely varied career while stay in the same company ... good of both world .
incredibly collaborative , open culture where sharing_knowledge - sharing_knowledge be the default .
e.g. , I have often use keyword to pick someone name out of the corporate book_address book_address ( when I need a expert , but do know anyone to ask ) , and email or call they and say " I be look for someone to help with x " , and not once have anyone say " not my job " - every single time , and I talk <S-CARDINAL> of time - the person help I directly or give I a introduction .

<S-CARDINAL> friend go from management_product management_product , where he be a functional expert on a topic work with the <S-ORG> team_Sales , to be a consultant and travel to work with customer on - site .

that incredibly rare .
the corporate culture be the good thing about the company .

additional pro , depend on your role ( with approval_manager approval_manager ) you can work remotely from other <S-ORG> office or location .

or if I take vacation to <B-GPE> <I-GPE> <I-GPE> <E-GPE> for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , I could extend the trip by <B-DATE> <E-DATE> and enjoy a <S-ORDINAL> weekend travel around , and work <B-DATE> <E-DATE> from our office in <S-GPE> , and then fly home <S-DATE> when the rate be cheap .

- why be client still buy and / or renew ?
no good full solution_suite solution_suite on the market , it a ton of time , money , work , resource to change vendor , <S-ORG> rep at the level_Enterprise level_Enterprise be the good in the market .. overpromise / under deliver and they damned good at it .
- Volume and rapid pace of ever - change internal process make it painful for employee and customer .

- for once in the company history , fix <B-ORG> <E-ORG> .
really , I mean fix it .
it be talk about for <S-DATE> , it be promise by multiple leader for <S-DATE> , and all you can come up with be mask the problem with different conventions_naming convention to make the client feel like they get a good deal , when they still get a rep_support rep_support who can hardly speak <S-LANGUAGE> , or a rep_support ticket_support for a simple fix will still get bounce around for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> instead of <B-DATE> <E-DATE> ?
company be too mature with too many big clients_name client to continue mess around with a weak excuse for support_customer support_customer .
again , reel back on hire carriers_quota carrier , get customer support Support_fix , get customer happy , not piss , they will become our partner and reference for even more big clients_name client , it will hurt initially , but it will pay off over <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , but for sake_god sake_god Support_fix customer support .

there have be acquisition and some challenge with management_change management_change there , but it be get good .
additionally I have have feel unheard on some criticism on occasion - which be definitely a area of improvement .
advice : listen to your staff - give they credit for their idea , do just take they and implement they .
with acquisition and acquire team take more time and care in the transition .
pro : <S-ORG> have a lot of positive that make it a extremely attractive workplace .
the life_work - life_work balance_life be fantastic , and in my tenure here I have never feel like no one care about my health , family , personal emergency .

the main disadvantage be balance_work balance_life balance_work .
while management try to promote a healthy <S-ORG> there be situation where I need to sacrifice personal time to resolve critical issue of travel unexpectedly to manage situations_customer situation .
advice : continue to push your employee to be good person and more successful .
pro : I thoroughly enjoy work for <S-ORG> .
I feel challenge by my work which keep I interested and engage which I feel be important in the field of engineering .
most importantly I feel that the team_management team_management want I to succeed and many go out of their way to help I .
compensation be fair and <S-ORG> provide amenities_plenty amenity ( subsidise meal / free facilities_gym facility etc. ) which make go to the office more enjoyable .
con : ever since <S-ORG> buy the place , <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of the employee have leave .
so some of the remain be quickly promote to senior management .
vast majority of they have minimum social skill .
just think there enough vps and director with whom I can have a conversation about the weather !
most of they have <S-CARDINAL> to <S-CARDINAL> direct report .
there be enough director with no direct report .
I know of <S-CARDINAL> director who work <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> , and they set up <S-CARDINAL> - 1 and other meeting after <B-TIME> <E-TIME> , because here baby sleep by <B-TIME> <E-TIME> !
as a result the remain worker be pile on a huge amount of work .
more than a typical startup .
the people_support person be useless , hence development and qa have to find the issue .
the scales_pay scale be typically <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> and less than market rate .
no option .
you will constantly remind that you be get pay too much .
typically some junior developer in <S-GPE> will decide the schedule_sprint schedule_sprint and once the date be give there be no changing .
if <S-ORG> find <S-CARDINAL> bug , you will warn about termination .
the team in <S-GPE> and <S-GPE> work <S-CARDINAL> to <S-CARDINAL> .
so they schedule meeting most evening_sun and evening_sun evening_sun .
if you object or miss one , you will terminate .
its pretty common for a manager to insult and berate their employee in front of everyone .
if you defend yourself , you will be terminate .
<S-PERSON> expect much support from <S-ORG> .
they will tell that you be a slave and have to work anytime the manager want .
no down time on evening , weekend or vacation .
they will typically offer some money if you agree to leave quietly .
after you sign the paperwork_exit paperwork_exit , understand that they will tell you that you violate some clause and that the money be be withhold .
this be typical .
as you can imagine , skilled person come and go .
during the last <S-ORG> survey_SAP , <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> say they do not trust their boss !
this be the low in <S-ORG> .
advice : none pro : releases <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , friendly workers_co worker , tray_fruit tray_fruit every morning , regular social , outside speaker , bashes_beer bash
<B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> try to do too much .
initiative upon initiative .
hard to focus scarce resource .
advice : listen to employee more .
identify low performer and weed they out .
simplify .
cut unnecessary cost , reduce overhead and accentuate pay for performance .
person be happy but not hungry to drive the company .
they be more focus on tout themselves and stand out from the crowd .
this be because the company have many internal group and division that be all align .
the company should follow its own recommendation to run simple , but they have yet .
pro : Dynamic and constantly evolve .
Limited only by your ambition and energy .
lot of smart and connect person .
everyone be friendly and generally helpful .
con : high level of red tape because of the large organization .
what would take <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> elsewhere to complete could take <S-DATE> here .
it be be slice , dice , and dismiss in favor of <B-ORG> <E-ORG> , both local in the form of contractor and outsource service - usually do poorly .
poor leader in <S-GPE> , desperately hold onto control despite gross incompetence .
advice : move management away from <S-GPE> , they be poison .

move between team usual allow / encourage .
money for project be generally not a problem , especially at <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .

<S-CARDINAL> history of great success_engineering success_engineering be also a downside now .
too much development_product development_product come from beliefs_engineering belief about critical processes_business process <S-DATE> .
they be out of touch and the market be move past <S-ORG> new solution .
advice : really understand the market you want to reach and then design the next products_gen product .
all evidence point to new solution that be over - engineer and complex - precisely what company say they want to avoid .
pro : great position_software and market position_software .
lot of talent a
nd experience in most senior ranks_exec rank .
Truly a global company in every way .
con : keep pace with the number of advancement <S-ORG> have .
for customer its great because they can focus on what they need at the time and know <S-ORG> have it .
however for employee , we be expect to know what they be and it take time to learn they all .
advice : continue build team of expert for individual app for employee to go to for answer .
pro :
the most innovative company I have ever work for .
<S-ORG> be change the landscape with new technology that most person have even think about .
I like work at a company where I know the product be the good , most creative , and benefit its customer good than any other solution can .
con :
there be a large disparity in policies_employment policy due to the gain strength of ' <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> in <S-GPE> and other <S-NORP> country ( a.k.a. worker council ) .
this country have strong protection_worker protection_worker law / policy .
every time there be a corporate <S-ORG> ( ~ every <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> ) , country with no social agreements_partner agreement tend to get the lion - share of the force reduction ; so while worker in <S-GPE> , as a example , get move to another role , worker in <S-GPE> have their role ' eliminate ' .
unfair .
and while it may be unavoidable , it lead to double - standard .
unfortunate for a company that pride itself on be a ' global ' company .
advice : see con pro : good pay / bonus
<S-ORG> have a heart , it try to do the right thing by the employee ... but ...
con : I could not find any down side to work for the company .
I could not find any down side to work for the company .
they could have more way to get to the station_train station_train be all I could say .
advice : keep up the good work with the way you pay attention to you worker .
I like the '' my door be always open '' policy which work well for everyone .
pro : employee be very nice and friendly .
work environment_Work be bright with a great view of <B-LOC> <I-LOC> <I-LOC> <E-LOC> .
person sit next to each other and across from each other .
meeting room can be book online or from the room it self .
con :
too many tactics_bully tactic use by leadership .
leader who yell at , use high - communication_pressure communication_pressure , can be acceptable .
beat the harding_drum harding_drum may get the result - but kill the engagement , and impact customer directly .
still way too little diversity - and that go for style as well as race / gender .
need to make " autocratic tactics_command and control " tactic unacceptable instead of reward with promotion .
we need " leader of the future " - why be our most motivational leader leave , or be show the door ?
person will follow and go above and beyond for leader who empower they and provide a real vision base on a true knowledge and passion for the field .
Recent change in leadership in <B-ORG> <E-ORG> business_Cloud be right out of the " old model_SAP model_SAP " - quickly dissipate energy and motivation of very talented person .
everyone have their head down to stay out of the way .
not the culture we want .
- career option : I can tell you how many " fast track " employee have apply for job internally , and never even get a response .
we totally should be handle internal applicant differently - any time <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> apply for a job internally - the golden glove should come out .
why be they look to move ?
be there a issue ?
this be datum that should trigger a response by management - not just recruiting .
it should include a session_coaching session_coaching to understand what they be look to do , the full context , and then actively look for a role for they .
yes - a high - performing employee should have a advantage , and research say they cost less , and add more value .
why be we leverage this ?
in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , way too many talented person I know leave because there be " nothing " here for they .
they could find a job internally - and we make it way too hard to make a lateral move without sacrifice compensation .
this be a real opportunity for we to figure this out because this be the way of the future workforce .
advice : critical advice :
<S-CARDINAL> ) dashboard of complaints_bullying complaint - know where your problem be - and <S-ORG> .
employee file complaint about bully be wait <S-DATE> before your <S-ORG> investigator can even do a investigation .
this be a real sign .
a log_back - log_back like this mean something .
employee be leave to suffer or move on .
bullying education_Bullying should be do / mandatory session - it be subtle and destructive on so many level .
there be clue , and there should be anonymous way to find the bully in our culture , root they out and get they out .
bully emerge when they be bully .
there be a connection between the leadership_hammer leadership_hammer style_leadership , and this issue .
let connect the dot , and take action .
most " bully " person know about - but no action be take .
<S-CARDINAL> ) talent " atrisk " situation : introduce a process to " remove " talented employee from boss , when they have make a formal complaint , if they have a strong history of success .
why take the risk of lose they ?
move they .
lead company in management_talent management_talent have dedicate " teams_coach " team for internal to help they find job internally - as a service - when they be look for development_career development_career .
at a minimum we should do this in situations_bully situation / er complaint_ER situation - this should be institute for " talent at risk " .
even a temporary assignment would get they out of the situation , and save the talent .
<S-CARDINAL> ) use our technology to protect employee 24x7_wellness - 24x7_wellness email and communication be kill the energy and 24x7_wellness .
let be a leader in figure out how to respect our employee private time .
lead a tank_cross organizational tank_think tank_cross on this - it tie to our focus on wellness - let innovate and respect our employee , and sustain our energy .
everyone be cope with this - let lead_lets .
<S-CARDINAL> ) Chief Pools_Expert / seasoned Talent pool - we need good skill to set up team , and to lead team effectively - multi-functional / cross - functional - not teams_silo functional team , and to intentionally bring in the right / diverse expertise .
this would also provide opportunity for more seasoned talent to bring in their perspective , and experience , blend it with fresh perspective and young generation .
so much be good - but for a company of our size , the fact that we have no Development_Org development / Management_Culture management function_Development - be unacceptable .
culture be it in this day and age , and every selection_leadership selection_leadership decision_selection make be critical .
we have no rigor to our selections_leadership selection - no assessment , we not leverage research_agility research_agility / assessment , and we not get <B-DATE> <E-DATE> feedback_day on new leader .
instead , leader select that like they and that replicate the culture of the past .
we can change this - let get rigorous about assessment for agility and motivation and talent for empowering and coaching / engage employee .
we a datum company_data - let use " person datum " at the next level and lead the way .
why be " centers_assessment center " and bring the good of person datum science_data into our tool a focus ?
use it <S-ORDINAL> with our HR .
I know we figure it out - hopefully before more good talent leave .
I be look forward to our ongoing effort to " run good " .
pro : <S-ORG> hire bright talented employee ; I have never work with so many smart person .
positive : in cloud_HR cloud_HR business_cloud , good structure around sale content_sales / learning be a improvement in align messaging_market messaging_market - this have long be missing .
anticipating_Innovation - anticipate and invest in product_breakthrough product_breakthrough devt_product - like bus Bias_Beyond Bias_Beyond - very cool , and forward lean .
break out from the pack .
very good - keep anticipate and build for the future , not the past .
we need good intentionality around the " anticipate " - not enough resource out there track trends_HR trend / work closely with <S-ORG> and business leader to help drive the innovation , and be there .
bus beyond Bias happen but what next - many area be perfect for we to take on .
this would be a great investment .
con : grossly underpay compare to the <B-LOC> <E-LOC> standard_Valley if you convert from a intern to full - time .
in this sense , they undervalue that who have work their way up within the company .
employee who do start off as intern but instead start as full - employees_time employee make <S-CARDINAL> - 30 thousand more for some reason .
advice : pay that employee who have work their way up from be intern .
<S-ORG> be a great company to work for , but with such a expensive cost_living cost_living within the area_bay area_bay , it be literally hard to make a cost_living with the amount you pay this employee .
pro : work / balance_life balance_Work be great .
Free-ish lunch ( depend on what you get ) .
opportunity to travel for work depend on the team you on .
great person .
con :
there be a lack of diversity at the high level of management .
there be a commitment to improve diversity and inclusion , but it be very slow in the making especially with person of the <S-NORP> diaspora .
advice : I hope <S-ORG> truly commit to improve diversity and inclusion and not just with woman , but with black and brown person at all level of the company .
it be a great company but should well represent the community it service .
pro : <S-ORG> have a great culture and some of the smart and most enjoyable person to work with , it be in my opinion a family .
additionally without a doubt , <S-ORG> have the good software to make the world run good .
con : when <S-ORG> lose <B-PERSON> <E-PERSON> , it lose its visionary .
now the company be run by arrogant and absorbed_self - absorb senior manager .
the result be that employee have become a commodity .
you will not be value nor feel as though what you do ( or think ) matter .
do not consider have a life outside of <S-ORG> .
be prepare for be lose in a large quagmire of a company .
advice : a little humbleness go a long way , so do respect .
your staff be human too , look beyond your inflated_ego inflate rhetoric and try , just try to value the person that work for you .
pro :
<S-ORG> represent a great heritage of treat it employee well .
unfortunately that be lose .
the company have a great base of technology_application technology_application that can really improve a company operation .
it have the potential for a return to greatness .
do I mention the free lunch ?
con : - back to <S-ORG> ;
- very slow , monstrous making_decision making_decision process_making ;

you can move and advance from <S-CARDINAL> role to another without leave <S-ORG> ( development_product development_product , consulting , marketing , sale , etc. . )
- global company .
you may travel a lot if you like and you will work with person from different location with different culture , tradition , norm , and pace of work
con :
the structure_bonus structure_bonus have be severely cut in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> as have the benefit .
consultant can hit a run_home run_home advice :
when projects_consulting manager_project do go well - do look to punish the manager_project manager_project - it could be that the client have faction work to make the manager_project difficult .
understand the situation and help the manager_project manager_project succeed if possible , else pull he off and help he to be successful on other manager_project if the <S-CARDINAL> manager_project be ' pollute ' with a poison .
pro : insider ( almost unlimited ) information_Insider on the product and service .
very deep base_knowledge base_knowledge from other employee when they be willing to share .
con : Politics and you still have to be belong to the popular crowd to become a star .
( this be not new as you should know this from high school hopefully )
advice :
when a new recruit join teach they or tell they about the how life work at <S-ORG> ( basically the playbook ) then let their talent dictate their destiny .
this then let they discover this year into it and already behind schedule pro :
all the resource to learn with instant recognition_brand recognition_brand if you move on .
your time here will prepare you for real life_world corporate life_world .
you will watch it with a great front seat_row seat_row at customer site .
con : large disparity in benefit between <S-GPE> and <S-GPE> employee due to laws_labor law .
time zone can be challenging , so there a heavy reliance on email .
advice : I think management be do a great job run the company .
there be definitely some challenge when bring new talent into the company from the outside where there be not a good cultural fit .
as a result , some key area have have a lot of turnover_management turnover_management .
some recent external hire be really poor cultural fit , and will likely result in good person leave the company before management admit to a bad hire and fix it .
pro : good work / balance_life balance_life .
good benefit .
great person .
flexible arrangements_work arrangement .
good variable pay include bonus , purchase_stock purchase_stock plan .

con : every step be a bureaucratic hurdle .
every action you want to take require touch <S-CARDINAL> or <S-CARDINAL> other team for approval .
scope be very tight and inflexible .
it may be the most boring place I ever work .
advice : keep person happy and interested be really simple .
provide a good environment_working environment_working where it easy to get your job do with opportunity for growth , both personal and professional .
your environment_working environment_working currently feel like pull tooth , endlessly turn a crank or both : endlessly turn a crank to pull tooth .

con : - product that be suffer from lack of development
- very unhappy customer
- lo compensation
- mediocrity throughout the organization be the norm
- falling standards_hiring standard
- high attrition_customer attrition_customer result in recoveries_commission recovery for salespeople
- very little room for growth_career growth_career advice : Concur have a business that need fixing , badly .
while it be ( in general ) a wonderful place to spend time every day , it be not such a great place for serious professional who care about serve the customer , innovate , and grow their career .
we be suffer from our failure to attract and retain talented person - likely cause by much low than average compensation , a static product , a fuzzy and lackluster mission_company mission_company , and a dysfunctional culture .
our inability to attract or retain talented person mean that our standard for work be on the decline , and that there be no need ( or reward ) for excellence .
the pervasive malaise at <S-ORG> impact everything - the speed of work , follow through , ownership , commitment , and ultimately satisfaction_customer satisfaction_customer .
we also suffer from a reluctance to invest in the product , inability to implement it for our customer , and our insistence on sell it by any means necessary .
this be a recipe for disaster .
I have be work at <S-ORG> in sale for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> and have serve client of all shape and size -

at <S-ORG> I could not do this , instead I need to take a entire sick or day_vacation day_vacation to complete my <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> visit_dentist visit_hour .
advice : encourage transparency - I do not see any link between my performance and compensation .

depend on both shift and team be prepare to never have the chance to take your company entitle <S-ORG> ( but your manager can be go every other week ) .
expect never to be provide expectation or kudo when you perform above and beyond .
do expect to be nit pick as jerk_knee jerk_knee reaction to something unrelated to you , or something that be minuscule and not impact bottom line or big picture .
basically , expect everything related to inexperienced management or toxic habits_leadership habit .
advice : this be more direct to senior management and above .
actively evaluate your <S-ORDINAL> managers_line manager .
do realize that performance ( or lack there of ) be a reflection of management .
you can blame low morale on the team themselves , hold the manager accountable .

btw a good metric on how well or poor someone lead be through retention .
I do not care what your group_target group_target or demographic look like , employment be hard to come by , so person leave in drove be a good indication there be a problem above .
do not credit it to the group_age group_age , its tasteless , make no sense and do not account for more experienced / educate person who also leave .
if you notice a trend in evaluation from employee , address it , because we all can possibly be make it up .
stick your nose in a bit more , fraternization that could lead to promotion , unsatisfactory .

if anything I would criticize their policies_reimbursement policy but only because they give the same per-diem in <B-GPE> <E-GPE> or <B-GPE> <E-GPE> as the do in USA_po-dunk <S-GPE> .
that shift the burden to the employee in more expensive city .

great leadership_C-Suite , attentive management that care for their employ and amazing <S-ORG> leadership_C-Suite .
<S-ORG> could learn a lot about management from <S-ORG> .
con : work for <S-ORG> , especially if you be <B-LOC> <I-LOC> <E-LOC> and you want to have a career with a meaningful purpose or comp be one of the bad choices_life choice you can make .
there a ton of problem at <S-ORG> , but I believe many of they be symptom of a extremely below compensation_market compensation_market and structure_incentive structure_incentive which nurture and reward a culture of mediocrity .
they key areas_problem area
be :
compensation ( note this be from the perspective of <S-ORG> ) :
- the compensation at <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> be severely below market .
New grad often get only around ~ <B-QUANTITY> <I-QUANTITY> <E-QUANTITY> ( total incl , bonus and stock ! ) and even as a seasoned engineer and high performer it be extremely difficult to get <B-QUANTITY> <E-QUANTITY> total comp .
most folk I know earn between <B-QUANTITY> <I-QUANTITY> <I-QUANTITY> <E-QUANTITY> ( again incl. bonus and stock ) and have around 5YoE and be usually pretty high perform .
while " <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> " sound like a lot somewhere else this be ridiculously bad for a company of SAP size in the area_bay area_bay when you be a high performer .
almost every startup , no matter how small will pay you more base than what <S-ORG> offer as <B-ORG> <E-ORG> and give you a generous option_stock option_stock package_option on top .
most big company of SAP size will pay you <B-QUANTITY> <I-QUANTITY> <I-QUANTITY> <E-QUANTITY> , often time <B-QUANTITY> <E-QUANTITY> than <S-ORG> ( FANG would go even 2.5x - 3 x if you get lucky ) .
furthermore the progression_salary progression_salary be very slow .
if you progress as a high performer you get often time only <B-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> increase_salary increase_% per year .
during a promotion you will normally get at max only get <B-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> more , often time less than that .
note typically you can get a promotion early every <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
on top of that almost everyone with your <S-PERSON> get pay the same , no matter how good or bad you perform .
i.e .
if you perform <S-CARDINAL> x to the bad person in your team , you probably still just earn about the same , max <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> more .
manager get a very small bonus and pool_salary pool_raise pool_salary that they have to distribute between folk .
furthermore the size_pool size_pool do depend on the performance of the team .
if you be in a team with only high performer the size_pool size_pool be the like in team with only low performer .
altogether the level_comp level_comp be extremely low and the system do not reward performance , therefore everybody be just coast and the whole atmosphere be very demoralizing .
extremely political and bad making_decision making_decision :
most of the middle management be extremely political and just try to keep their job / justify their existence and increase their team headcount_teams instead of actually make the right technology and decisions_product decision in the interest of the company .
I have <S-CARDINAL> SVP even admit this to I and say that at " <S-ORG> SVPs_SAP be like duke fight to keep power over their own little kingdom " .
if you want to experience got real life , be <S-ORG> guest .
often multiple organization worldwide work on a very similar problem but instead of join force they just make up arbitrary difference to avoid a conflict and keep their SVPs independent .
important decisions_technology decision be make by <S-ORG> and Architect in committee where <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of the person have write a single line of code in <S-DATE> .
every decision_tech decision_tech be affect by the " not - invent - here - syndrome " and instead of reuse exist prove tech_OSS decision_tech for non-differentiated component a bad copy_SAP - copy_SAP of a technology be develop , because leader believe they can easy sell proprietary copy_SAP decision_tech for top <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> to their customer .
this work in the beginning with some naive <S-ORG> customers_fanboy customer but never lead to a product_industry lead product_industry or technology and long term always lead to the same result : <S-ORG> lose in favor of a much good and cheap competitor .
in general whoever make the good ppt slide and talk the loud get to make decision and the promotion .
<S-ORG> be a sale machine_sales and not a company_tech company_tech , unfortunately .
immigration policy :
the policies_immigration policy at <S-ORG> be a absolute nightmare .
<S-ORDINAL> of all you have to beg your manager and <S-ORG> to file <S-ORG> and gc .
for <S-ORG> you have to be <B-DATE> <E-DATE> with the company until they start the process , unless you get a approval_exception approval_exception .
if you leave the company within <B-DATE> <E-DATE> after get the <S-ORG> , you have to pay back all the expenses_lawyer and filing expense .
the team_immigration team_immigration ( <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> ) be extremely unresponsive and often time do answer for <S-DATE> or <S-DATE> to your email .
you basically have to beg your manager to follow up with <S-ORG> / immigration on your behalf and even your manager do get answer for <S-DATE> at time .
furthermore they have some weird policy like that you have to be in particular level_T level_T ( level_career level_T at sap ) to file a gc in a particular category .
for example for EB_GC EB_GC - 3 you have to be in T2 .
if you be already in T3 this mean in some case your manager have to temporarily demote you to T2 in order to start the gc process_GC which be just another way of keep your comp down .
many folk I know be trapped_visa - trap_visa inside <S-ORG> on a visa_L1 or E1 trapped_visa and <S-ORG> use the trapped_visa trap_visa to keep folk inside the company on their subpar comp .
that folk would leave the company within a blink of a eye once they get the right visa .
subpar technology and Engineering :
the engineering and technology at <S-ORG> be pretty bad overall .
because of the politics often time bad decisions_tech decision be make and because of the bad SAP_comp <S-ORG> can get the right talent to consistently create good decisions_tech .
a lot of the technologies_core technology that you have to use in your work_day - to - work_day work_day be develop and be push by the <S-ORG> in <S-GPE> where person live in their own bubble and rarely hear or acknowledge of industry_tech industry_tech trend before it too late .
over - engineering be a serious problem as well .
for context I just want to add that I work at <S-ORG> multiple year , both in <B-ORG> <E-ORG> and in <B-GPE> <E-GPE> .
the experience describe not only represent my personal one but be consistent with the experience of my network in multiple team and location , incl .
<S-GPE> , <S-GPE> and <S-GPE> .
the only location which I would mildly recommend be <B-ORG> <E-ORG> due to very good perk and ok - comp_ish comp_ish ( that be say there be much good alternative there too ) .
it honestly appear like a miracle to I that <S-ORG> have a 4.4 <S-ORG> rating_Glassdoor and be rate as a good place to work , but can probably be explain with <S-ORG> be very good at marketing bad stuff_Marketing as gold .

my goal be to retire with <S-ORG> .
in addition to be happy with the environment_work that I do with <S-ORG> , the benefit and environment_work environment_work be notch_top notch_top !
this review would be too long to list all of the benefit .

well run organization ...
con : depend heavily on which team you be on , some team you do meaningful work that follow standard_industry standard_industry while some other team be not .
I interested in development_software development_software but a lot of stacks_tech stack be proprietary ( understandable since it a corporation ) .
not a lot of job related to SE in <B-LOC> <I-LOC> <E-LOC> .
advice : none pro : Interesting work , professional co-worker , great benefit such as stipend_lunch stipend_lunch , in - gym_company gym_company .
as a intern I feel like I be treat like a real employee instead of a intern .
a good place to intern at if you find a team that know what they be do .

I would not look at this company as be lead edge in the field_software field_software .
most company have spend so much money implement that they can get rid of this behemoth until fully depreciate .
highlight of my career at <S-ORG> be when they put together a agenda for a conference_user conference_user and the agenda say the man attend the talk and the woman be to go for messages_aromatherapy message , I keep that agenda and still have it post in my office to remind I of where I have come from and that you need to kiss a few frog along the way .
that kind of summarize the female career at <S-ORG> .
look at the board <S-DATE> I see nothing have change : <S-CARDINAL> man , <S-CARDINAL> woman ; <S-CARDINAL> <S-NORP> Indian_1 <S-NORP> ; <S-CARDINAL> <S-NORP> , <S-CARDINAL> <S-NORP> and <S-CARDINAL> <B-NORP> <E-NORP> ( this have really change since my day when it be <S-CARDINAL> <S-NORP> and I <S-NORP> ) .
so if you be a female serious about your career this be not the company for you .
if you be happy to sit in middle management and stay away from the sale man then plod your way through the various acceptable position for female , the ceiling_glass ceiling_glass here be low and thick .
there be a strange corporate culture and a lack of diversity .
for my sin I now have to engage with the sale man of <S-ORG> and I burst out laugh when they end a meeting with the wonderful line of ' so can you sign today ? '' - such a cliché .
advice : the supreme quality for leadership be unquestionably integrity .
without it , no real success be possible , no matter whether it be on a sport field_sports , in a army , or in a office .

quite a bit of " protect my territory " around group / team .
the company lose its acquisition_focus & agility post <S-ORG> acquisition_focus .
advice : watch out for that single - situations_point - of - failure situation .
there be quite a few of that .
pro : great person , can -do attitude share around most functional group .
cloud be in the company DNA .
this be a place to be to learn as much about cloud product .
con : - Bureaucratic setup that do not get much work do and too many middle manager who have no clue about development_software development_software .
- very many bad project and failure brush aside by smart teams_marketing & sale team .

Siloed teams_organization teams_structure - team seem to compete and not collaborate advice : now that merger with <S-ORG> have be confirm team need to understand the vision .

I know that more information be come in Q2 and I hope that it will provide a good sense of what the future hold - however , person be get nervous and I think that you be risk the loss of some talented person .
also , now be the time to look for strong management in general .
as we combine with <S-ORG> have strong manager that can position employee and team well will be imperative .
with a number of manager , I get the sense that there be a level of complacency .
the thought seem to be that <S-PERSON> will not change or that the situati
on will improve in general .
I do know that anyone in the rank believe that either outcome be probable .
when company merge the winner ( <S-ORG> in this case ) generally dictate the outcome .
the line_company line_company be that the combine org will grow , but , where the growth will take place have not be communicate .
if the growth be in CA or offshore that growth be meaningless to many at <S-ORG> .
also , the come merger seem to have put a chill effect on person help one another .

Strategic acquistion to enhance current offering include busienss object - Reports_Crystal report and <B-ORG> <E-ORG> .
cutomer focus .
con :
as a <S-NORP> company with a work council_works , " down in the weed " you can get person who be difficult to impossible to move out of their job into something more appropriate .
this be always slacker - sometimes it just a bad fit personally or skill - wise_skills , but this be the side_flip - side_flip of a company where almost no one ever get fire .
<S-ORG> be a huge company , and make a change here be like turn a cruiseship - it do happen fast , ever .
so it can be frustrating to feel like we can be as agile as other company when we need to be .
advice : conduct more " <S-CARDINAL> " review of executive manager .
we be routinely poll on the performance of our direct manager , but the majority of problem I experience have be with my manager manager , or another level up - and we do have the chance to give that feedback typically .
pro : I never see a business where information be share so freely among co-worker and team .
it a very entrepreneurial company , so you can really mold your experience here depend on what you be interested to do .
the majority of manager be very supportive to enable you to get what you want from your job and experience with <S-ORG> , and with its <S-NORP> heritage , life_work - life_work balance_life be usually very good ( e.g. , policy_vacation policy_vacation , sick day , schedules_flex schedule ) .
there be virtually never layoff ... the <S-ORG> go to great extreme to find way to prevent this , and even acquisition do always result in mass layoff .
I be impress at their handling of the finances_company finances_company , especially during the recession .
I work with a amazing group of person who really care about our customer , their work , and the quality of our software .
I very proud to be a employee , and I understand why so many person who start as customer end up work here .
con : I normally do rant like this but I be sooooo disappointment in my aide_Kool - aide_Kool high_aide go down and what the real deal be that I have to tell you to beware of the hype .
just because they have a " no jerk " policy_Jerks and it on the way mean absolutely nothing .
this be <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> that do even use their own tool and consequently , there be no true alignment_goal alignment_goal , employee feel disengaged and under-valued , and the moral be low .
training at <S-ORG> be a bootcamp where <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of the material be irrelevant to your actual job and then they have you do a event_volunteer event_volunteer to feel warm and fuzzy .
you then expect to get all the training you need from outdated record session and everyone be too busy to actually answer your question .
to top it off , sell a product where the implementation may / may not go well and the service_customer service_customer leave much to be desire cause the sale rep to question the integrity of what they sell to service_customer .
lo life_work - life_work balance_life and sale team_sales be stress out because management bully they with re-assignments_territory re-assignment and micromanagement .
there be a <S-ORG> policy_WFH however it be only give to some sale rep while other be force to be in the office ( favortism ) .
this under-performing same rep be also allow to build up exist account while other be all net new .
solution consultant that want to be sale rep fight against support the sale team_sales the way they need it and management have figure out how to make the work_relationship work_relationship .
the successfacccor sale team_sales can tell you that they honestly have a clue what direction the company be head , it the end of Q1 and no plan_comp plan_comp have be share ( wtf! ) , and the team_finance team_sales can get the commission right .
advice : let really start " drink our own champagne "
stop be jerk !
stop micromanaging
stop the favortism and politics of fight over crumbs_bread crumb .
figure out that your <S-ORG> be wayyyyy good with <S-ORG> .com_Salesforce and drop the crap you use <S-DATE> .
lastly , try communicate with the employee ( for real this time ) and give they a chance to have a voice in how their job / life will be impact .
pro : <S-ORG> be a leader in the market with a rich parent support our effort .
when the machine be lubricate and in motion , it next to impossible to stop the momentum .
very powerful !
listen to the ceo , <S-PERSON> and <S-PERSON> be inspirational and they have a great way of motivate you to believe you can do it ( whatever " it " be ) .

no one take ownership and ps be leave hold the bag .
Upper management know there be issue but ignore they - weak executive management do address the key frustration with why person hate it here .
lack of accountability and ownership among department ; no one be focus on work together to fix issue .
advice : pay attention to death by <S-CARDINAL> papercut - that cause your smart employee to burn out .
do let person get away with ignore issue until they be escalate to the ceo .
pro : flexible schedule , work from opportunities_home opportunity , autonomy
con :
not great at the compensation .
still follow old methodology and slow in adopt change .
some time politics may come in line .

con :
it be hard to find information in all the noise of the corporate portal , or a person who could provide the right information .
it seem there be several group work on the same thing , and group do not necessarily talk to each other .
advice : none pro : pay and benefit be great , although my salary ( from many year at a acquire company ) may have be a reason I be part of a layoff .
many opportunity to learn / work - as long as you be in the right location .
the company be focus on improve experience_user experience_user across its line_core line_software line_core .
con :
the process_company making_decision - making_decision process_company be simply too " silo- ed " .
the right hand do know what the left hand be do , and it lead to decision that can be detrimental to the entire organization ( because the decision be make with the good of a single organization in mind ) .
advice : break down the silo .
level_product decision need to be make at a level_product level_product , with input from each of the silo that be affect by it .
not make decision within a single silo that affect every silo that the product touch .
pro : the <S-ORG> have great benefit and great pay .
con :
as every big company for time it be hard to get stuff do at <S-ORG> .
advice : keep the open - door policy_doors and the great environment with great multinational opportunities_career opportunity .
run simple must continou the mantra and main focus_business focus_business !
pro : <S-ORG> be by far the good company I have work for .
the opportunities_career opportunity be great , the salary be competitive , the environment be cool and the open - door encorage you to seak up .
benefit be also great , one of the good in my location .
the multi-national portfolio_exposure and development portfolio_exposure be amazing .
at <S-ORG> I be able to partner with the smart person in industry_technology industry_technology !
con :
some parts_legacy part of the company , particularly in the country_home country_home , tend to be somewhat bureaucratic and resistant to change .
company lack transparency around some topic and restructure far too often to appease ego and opinion rather than strategies_support strategy .
advice : more transparency and consistency .

core cultural value and belief be very supportive and person focus .
lot of opportunty to do different thing .
con : can be challenging to climb the ladder .
reorganize often .
as a SE your schedule_travel schedule_travel be unpredictable , make it challenging to keep personal appointment and attend events_family event .

shock_Culture shock_Culture as to just how go
od it be here compare to many of my last employer .
easy to see why it be <B-WORK_OF_ART> <I-WORK_OF_ART> <I-WORK_OF_ART> <I-WORK_OF_ART> <E-WORK_OF_ART> in the <S-GPE> .
con : although the description_job description_job state that the role be for a <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> position_Representative , you be really a overpaid <S-ORG> .
the truth be this role consist of cold prospects_calling prospect <B-TIME> <E-TIME> a day with the sole purpose of set appointment for <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> to follow up with potential new business .
the practice that <S-PERSON> use to reach out to prospect be the big reason I leave .
you will be force to mail blast_merge / email blast_merge <S-CARDINAL> of new prospect , then follow up with they via telephone .
email this prospect constantly , call they constantly , lead to a ton of rejection .
they implement new software to cut down on the blast_email blast_email <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , but with limited to send <S-CARDINAL> blast_email a day , they switch back to the " mentality_spray and pray " mentality_spray .
get use email merge , daily , sometimes reach out to <B-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> person at a time .
it seem like they do care about saturate their territory with constant email .
you must perform well in the <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> position for a minimum of <B-DATE> <E-DATE> prior to be look at go into any other role ; in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , you must be hit <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> to goal each month or you will not be promote .
that simple .
the goal keep get high and high because they want to get to <B-MONEY> <E-MONEY> in revenue by <S-DATE> .
this be constantly preach .
this position be well suit for someone straight out of college , very flexible with hours_work hour ( some rep hours_work <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <I-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> daily ) , no kid , and live close to the <B-FAC> <I-FAC> <E-FAC> location_St. .
a large number of the current <S-ORG> do not like the position at all , but be work hard to possibly be look at to be promote down the road .
advice : Leadership share a " it never good enough mentality_type mentality_type " .
Leadership have their favorite within the group and they make that know .
if you do well , leadership will give you time and attention .
management must inform person interested in this role what it really like , not just talk about the incentive of work there ( free soda / cater lunch ) like they do in my interview .
pro : great culture .
some of the person I work with in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> be amazing !
nice office .
unlimited options_soda / LaCroix_coffee / <S-ORG> option .
they cater in food all the time .
con :
at time , the thing that make <S-ORG> such a great company , like individuality , innovation , autonomy in one job , can be the big challenge .
establish a good network of key contact from one_day one_day be a must , and allow tracking and follow of new development across the entire organization - even outside one_day area_business area_business .
find a good mentor and be prepare to work_team in a '' work_team work_team '' approach_work .
while work remote might be acceptable , work close to a official location_office location_office may also help with establish that relationship ( though most leadership be distribute throughout the world , as in many global company ) .
<S-ORG> be a <S-NORP> company , the treatment of employee be very fair and considerate ( maybe more so than many <S-GPE> company ) yet they be not immune to continuous change in the industry , which lead to organizational enhancement from time to time ( for the most part not reduction , yet change in manager or team ) .
this will be easy to digest with a good network and a positive attitude in place .
advice : - continue to communicate the successful corporate strategy often
- continue to focus on employee as " the most valuable asset "
- continue to lead the leader_industry with the most innovative solution for software_business around the Pros_world pro : despite be the Pros_world leader_industry leader_industry for software_business software_business , <S-ORG> manage to keep a '' small feeling_team '' feeling_team - where colleague work in a respectful and agile way .
key focus have be , and be , to deliver value for SAP customer ( internal and external ) .
from small enhancement to reimagine entirely new processes_business process , <S-ORG> bring some of the smart person in the industry together to drive and solve tomorrow innovations_technology innovation .
know that a majority of the world economic activity be process on <S-ORG> system , and seamlessly connect producer of goods with consumer , make we proud .
know that many of our technology and financial contribution be use to help and well the life of less fortunate citizens_world citizen , show commitment to purpose and heart .
SAP management solicit and use feedback_employee feedback_employee in its daily practices_business practice result in a environment of trust , respect , and genuine practice of '' feedback_employee be the most valuable asset '' .
be part of the <S-ORG> family_SAP mean , one never run out of option to further develop , learn , grow , and take advantage of opportunity .
there be <S-CARDINAL> of colleague that be ready to support , be it for mentorship_business mentorship_business , a personal challenge , or simply to have a friendly competition of encourage tracking_fitness tracking_fitness as part of life_work - life_work balance_life and a healthy lifestyle .
<S-ORG> have generous benefit and pay - which be only <S-CARDINAL> part of the equation .
the boundless opportunity , with opportunities_learning opportunity , advice and mentorship - as well as the ability to work with and learn from top international talent_industry talent_industry be a priceless experience not many company can match .
I can highly recommend <S-ORG> to anyone look for a true opportunity that go beyond of just be a job .
con :
it be a large company and easy to get lose .
good idea will not necessarily be adopt - there be <S-CARDINAL> if not <S-CARDINAL> of product / sub- product and not all of they be favor .
I do not notice it while work there but now realize management really do not know what they be do and flail try to find the right market .
advice : none pro :
it can be difficult but not impossible to get notice and make a impact .
immediate management be very supportive .
if you be lucky if you work on product / team that be the current interested in the company
con :
the direct compensation_pay compensation_pay be good , but could be well compare to opportunity at companies_consulting / partner company .

that who have be hire into leadership be out of touch with that who be do the actual work .
we have a lot of manager but not a lot of real leader .
person be disgruntled and dissatisfied .
there be very little real training outside of the <S-ORG> team_Sales .
the <S-ORG> team_Leadership talk about training constantly but will not invest any money in training or resource .
advice : get dirty .
go talk to the person who be actually do all the work , not that who be manage they and be feed you the " corporate " clich .
be concerned about your manager .
so many new manager have little or no person experience_people be be do a poor job of manage their staff .
decision be be make in the good interest of the manager career_managers not the good interest of the company .
put your money where your mouth be .
stop talk about programs_training and then never deliver on good programs_training program .
the customer be the one suffer for lack of training , bad decisions_management decision , and inefficiency .
stop listen to person that you be hire from other company who know nothing about how this company work .

pro :
the compensation and benefit at the company be pretty good .
there be person who work here who be amazing and make it a good place to work .
there be some opportunities_career opportunity because of the size of the company .

the ceo be a bit of a wacko and send crazy email and the management will drive you into the ground with long hour and lot of work .
horrible experience .
advice : hire ! !

pro : Young entrepreneurial culture , competitive pay and bonus , work from home ok .
con :
this company drink its own <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> .
instead of dig out deficiency & work on solve they , the management across the company_cloud spend more time build slides_powerpoint slide to show why <S-ORG> be the good company_cloud company_cloud in the world .
I think they come up with this metric to secure their bonus for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
the reality be that <S-ORG> be nowhere close to be the good player_cloud player_cloud and it will take quite a bit to get there .
in the long run this will be a more serious issue .
advice : raise standards_management standard and do turn a blind eye or reward poor standards_management .
pay should be base on performance .
pro : nice colleague , slightly above average pay , benefits_commuter benefit , free food , location_office location_office , be part of <S-ORG> give access_company access_company to lot of resource .
con :
most likely need to relocate to advance in the company ( which you may consider a " pro " or a " con " ) .
<S-GPE> be the <S-ORG> and thus the center of <S-ORG> universe even though great idea spring up all over the company .
not really a " con " , but <S-PERSON> put it here :
you must be a builder_consensus builder_consensus in order to succeed .
advice : none pro : smart person who work hard .
there be a emphasis put on with
life_ork - life_ork balance_life .
redundancy be be clean up throughout the company .
training be available , if you need take advantage of it .
con :
can be a very bureaucratic and bound_process - bound_process place , and a tendency to be quite conservative in term of go to market and strategy_product strategy_product .
advice : there be some incredibly bright person here , and a name_brand name_brand that command respect in <B-LOC> <E-LOC> , but at the same time <S-ORG> have a reputation for be overly cautious and conservative .
this perception need to change in order for the company to compete for talent with other <S-LOC> corporate giant that do have this perception .
pro : lot of innovative , bright person to work with , a very low key corporate culture , and nice amenities_campus amenity in <B-GPE> <E-GPE> .

<B-PERSON> <E-PERSON>
con : very organization_process drive , very complex matrixed organization_process with goal often not align across all <S-ORG> .
Politics can get in the way of good business because of the sheer size of the organization .
advice : simplify the go to market to weed out complexity .
pricing be too complex and take too many iteration to position with customer .
the company need to pivot to the cloud with more focus .
compensation get in the way of sell innovation in some example pro : sale machine_Sales with a good strategy .
great software focus on drive value for customer .
the company treat its employee very well .
overall , great company to work for .
con :
like other companies_tech company , expect a continuous flow of change within the organization .
it can be confusing at time .
if you find that unsettling , this probably be the right industry for you .
advice : none pro : I come to <S-ORG> through a acquisition <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
while it can be tricky ( and confusing ) at time to navigate the continuous change that occur at companies_tech company , I really appreciate the positive and collaborative culture at <S-ORG> .
nearly all colleague <S-PERSON> work with at <S-ORG> be truly nice person who be focus on make a positive impact to the company and its customer .
con : Big company , so there be a ton of resource , team , and training_onboarding training_onboarding which can be complex to navigate at <S-ORDINAL> .
advice : I love how management be always supportive , engage , and available to build their team .
continue to offer interactions_face - to - interactions_face interaction and building_team building_team experience be go to be critical -- it help our building_team continue to make great stride and measureable impact in our market .
Communication and collaboration in this digital age be so important !
pro : flexible workspace , fun and connect culture , supportive environment , focus on growth and learning , innovative , collaborative
con : the most extensive " culture_meeting " culture_meeting I ever see in a <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> career_year - I could spend <B-TIME> <E-TIME> a week in culture_meeting if I accept all my invitation ; as a global organization , the workday can extend from <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> to connect with the <S-NORP> colleague all the way to very late night to connect with the <S-ORG> ( <S-GPE> , <S-GPE> ) colleague advice : pick one day per week to be meet - free_meeting and penalize person who do obey pro : respect for employee , excellent benefit , good salary , recognition for hard work and time invest
con : many of the department be very territorial .
you will frequently find that the most stressful part of your job will be deal with other employee of <S-ORG> that do not understand that in the end you be all on the same team .
explanation on how to perform every tasks_day task in the system be poorly document and the instruction that come from <S-GPE> be rarely helpful because they do everything differently over there .
the sale team_sales can be very arrogant and difficult to work with .
many of the department do not have flexible hour .
there be a school of thought that believe the $ <S-MONEY> per diem for lunch at the cafeteria be design to get employee to stay in the building all day and eat lunch at your desk so that they essentially get <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> of work out of you .
expect to be there <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> every day , there be no skip lunch and leave early .
currently <B-ORG> <E-ORG> be in a freeze_hiring freeze_hiring and have be since <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
there have be no word on when the freeze_hiring freeze_hiring will be lift .
quarter end for finance be a nightmare .
if you have a family and want to spend <S-DATE> , <B-EVENT> <I-EVENT> <E-EVENT> , or <B-DATE> <E-DATE> with they this be not the place for you .
I be not exaggerate when I say I leave the building on <B-EVENT> <I-EVENT> <E-EVENT> at <B-TIME> <E-TIME> and there be several person that be still there .
advice : I understand that the company be drive by sale , but I would advise your sale force_sales to have some compassion and understanding for the team that need to do the work after their contract be sign .
the reality be that once they get they sign and they be high five each other the work be just begin for many other department , they need to keep that in mind when they be get thing sign at <B-TIME> <E-TIME> on <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
the company need to do something about the isolation of all of their department .
I have never work for a company where so many person be completely in the dark about the functions_job function and responsibility of other department they interact with every day .
<S-CARDINAL> word .... Training_Cross training .
how about loosen up the <S-PRODUCT> hour a bit ?
we be in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> here guy , some of we have long commute .
the soon we can get in , get our work do , and get home to our family the good off we will all be .
pro :
the salary be pretty good for the position .
the benefit include the $ <S-MONEY> per diem for lunch be great .
depend on the department you work for you may have the opportunity to work from home .
con : speed and agility -
this be definitely a area <S-ORG> can improve on .
I have often feel that <S-ORG> leadership_SAP lack decisiveness .
so , in several area you see similar product compete with other <S-ORG> product , and it could be confusing .
this often affect the speed of delivery .
there be also more resistance to change , so you could get stuck with " dead " product or technology for a while .
Proprietary technology - <S-ORG> flagship product - <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> - be build use proprietary technology .
in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , <S-ORG> have embrace more common stacks_technology stack to build solution , and I hope this will only increase and will improve the ease of development and speed of delivery .
not enough early talent - I feel that the average_industry age of a <S-ORG> employee_SAP be high than the average_industry average_industry .
this be a huge benefit due the experience and levels_knowledge level that reflect in high quality of products_software product the company produce .
but , it be important to balance this with early talent to leverage new idea , trend , skill and energy they can bring .
advice : please focus more on perk and benefit to improve engagement_employee engagement_employee and satisfaction .
small gift , perk , awards_spot award and similar benefit can improve satisfaction_employee satisfaction_employee tremendously .
in dynamic markets_job market like <B-LOC> <E-LOC> or <S-GPE> , this can play a important role in retain talent , and even attract new and young talent .
pro : I have be with <S-ORG> for over <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
that it itself be a testament to how value and comfortable the company make you feel as a employee .
with <S-ORG> , you get the feeling that you be work on high products_value product that make a impact_material impact_material to how business be run .
the brand be highly respect in the industry .
work culture_Work be great , very open and employee friendly .
pay and benefit be okay , it be good than average market , but the upside be limit as there be no sharing_profit sharing_profit or RSU grant on a regular basis .
the good part be , <S-ORG> provide great opportunity to move within the company to new job and team , and invest in development_talent development_talent .
con : some redundancy in role / compete project ; ton of administrative hurdle in IT , HR , payroll , and benefit ; not enough funding for projects_diversity project .
advice : keep the workplace fun !
allow more travel_company travel_company .
fund diversity_Fund inititive ( <S-NORP> , gender , minority ) at a much high rate .
pro : great opportunities_learning opportunity ; availability of extra experience outside of regular job ; lot of really smart person across the spectrum ( gender , age , nationality , etc. ) and around the world to collaborate with ; interesting project ( include driven_self - drive ) to help our customer help the world run well ( really , it not just a tagline ) ; balance_work anytime , anywhere and great balance_work / life balance_work in many role .
con : coffee & lunch be free , they have high goals_sustainability goal , they highly encourage volunteering & support_community support_community , they have a beautiful building , fun person , ton of opportunity to grow and learn internally and sometimes completely reinvent yourself .
so the big con be that you love it so much you will want to leave .
advice : keep it up !
we love Bill & Jen ! pro : women_industry lead woman equal opportunity .

con : deals_cloud compensation_Cloud model_compensation be not on par with standards_industry standard advice : re-evaluate how you pay compensation_Cloud on deals_cloud deal .
most companies_cloud company pay on log_back log_back to drive <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> deal versus penalize on <B-DATE> <E-DATE> deal deal .

<B-PERSON> <E-PERSON> be a fantastic ceo !!!
con : - too bureaucratic .
- way too many layoff , sometimes with horrible euphemism such as simplification .
" hey , life be simple , you do have a job " .
literally folk be say " I be simplify " .
I can stress how bad this hurt morale , and productivity .
folk stop help each other because they do want to make themselves irrelevant .
it be fascinating and terrifying to watch from the inside .
- if you be good at your job , it difficult to move up as your manager will likely not let you go .
( this be ultimately the reason that I eventually leave )
- for service , there be very high numbers_utilization number which mean you have to do improvement_training / improvement_self - improvement_training on your own time .
you also likely not take some of your <S-ORG> in a effort to make your number ( and ultimately your payment_bonus payment_bonus )
if you end up on short assignments_term assignment , it will be nearly impossible to make your number .
- you do always get a raise .
when you do , it likely fairly small .
over time inflation mean you make less .
- there be some new idea that make no sense .
example : they change the evaluation_employee evaluation_employee system_evaluation to something call " Talk_SAP talk " .
you no long get rate .
you simply have a conversation with your manager and set some goal .
but you be rate .
you have no idea really how you be do .
you have no idea how your performance will affect a raise ( if any ) .
I feel like my career go into a big fog once the rating go away .
advice : - add some clarity to progression_career progression_career .
- find some way for good employee to escape and move up when a manager want to keep they .
- for the good of all thing holy , get rid of this idea_SAP talk idea_SAP .
- I would have love to stay , but my career would have be stick .
so after a very long tenure , I move on .
I miss <S-ORG> , and I still think very fondly of the company .
pro : - great company !
- great product !
- motivate &amp ; charismatic ceo that could sell shoes_cement shoe to passenger on a ship_sinking ship_sinking .
- if you be in <S-GPE> , you probably have a job for life .
- very good policies_travel policy .
- excellent benefit .
- some year you get a very generous bonus .
- you will always be proud to work for <S-ORG>
con : what <S-PERSON> start be a genuine <S-ORG> company_SAAS .
thing go down downhill once the large SAP_corporation <S-ORG> buy out the company .
it seem as though <S-ORG> only interest be to slash off <S-ORG> force_work force_work and cripple its operation .
I can believe that <S-PERSON> leadership at level_Chief - level_Chief be able to do anything to stop this .
advice : <B-ORG> <E-ORG> have a share_market share_market and <S-ORG> operational decision make for <S-ORG> could be a conflict of interest give that <S-ORG> itself be a <S-ORG> company_SAAS now or try to become one , with very little success !
pro :
what it use to be be a open - minded culture_start - up culture_start .
but this be not the company that <S-PERSON> start anymore after <S-ORG> take control !
con : process and procedure ( that be necessary ) can feel confine .
this be sort of a con , but actually a plus .
you have to learn to connect and collaborate so that your work and development integrate and align with other project and directions_technology direction .
advice : love the interaction and <S-PERSON> ; A at all - hand meeting .
pro : embrace diversity and see our difference as a strength for the company .
proactive place woman in roles_management / leadership role .
forward - look and transform the company to meet the need of <B-DATE> <E-DATE> user .
great training , upskilling , and resources_mentor resource available .
opportunity to work with global colleague , expand your own point - of - reference .
con : - terrible compensation at <B-LOC> <I-LOC> <E-LOC> / area_bay area_SAP .
even though I have always be a top performer in my team ( I be <B-ORG> <E-ORG> for several time ) , even with my promotion / progression I have stay at <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of my level median salary .
raise have be <B-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> .
my only option ( I bind to <S-ORG> through my <S-ORG> and slow gc processing_GC ) be to switch to a company <S-ORG> acquire , which I do .
suddenly , it be the most normal thing in the world to be pay <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of my level median salary .
- slow Green processing_Card processing_Card - I not affect by this , but many of my peer complain about it .
<S-ORG> use <S-PRODUCT> for processing_Visa processing_Visa and they be terribly slow .
expect for a single email to answer by <S-PERSON> after <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , sometimes <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .
now figure how many year some person wait to just get their gc process_GC start .
- incompetent person &amp ; management_product management_product - most manager have no idea how software_cloud software_cloud be build and how teams_dev team have to be organize .
- report line across the ocean and back
- terrible quality_product quality_product : I do not know a single <S-ORG> quality_product that I enjoy use .
everything be just hack together .
- in the very end , no real creating_value - create work : development_Software development_Software at <S-ORG> be mainly about stitch together acquisition with our core .
all the new stuff ( learning_machine learning_machine , blockchain_IoT blockchain_IoT , etc. . ) be do at comparatively low investment ( politically and with resource ) mostly drive by non-technical person instead of " engineering_value engineering_value " .
- I have see a single " project_innovation " project_innovation succeed at <S-ORG> within <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> ( <S-PERSON> , etc. . ) .
everything be just stitch together somehow with no real strategy .
advice : let incompetent person go , pay good than <S-ORG> and hire the good in the industry .
change person roles_manager role to roles_engineering roles_manager role , up to the <S-ORG> .
pro : work - life_Work balance_life
beautiful campus in <B-GPE> <E-GPE>

con : <S-DATE> Premiums_Insurance premium just come out and there be a huge spike .
my colleague who have just herself on the plan see a <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> increase_% in her <S-DATE> premium for <S-DATE> vs. <S-DATE> .
mine be increase by a minimum of <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> .
<S-DATE> raise be minimal at good - during a time that the company be try to boost revenue for shareholder ... their workforce be most definitely feel the impact !
advice : take care of your person .
do give <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> notice_hours for your employee to be able to join and benefit Q&amp ; A - especially when there be such substantial change to plan , premium , deductible , out of maximums_pocket maximum , etc. .
pro :
do get I wrong , there be a lot to love about this company - mostly the person you work alongside .
con :
like any large company , there a potential for politics to come into play ; and like any job , whether you love or hate it will be largely dependent on your boss , the leadership of your specific organization , and the culture they establish .
management opportunity can often be base on personal connection over merit .
there seem to be lot of example of person quickly jump from the bottom of the company into very high positions_level position after work in " the office of the ceo " but how that opportunity be assign be a mystery to most employee .
<S-ORG> also tout a focus on " diversity and inclusion " - while it do seem that we have at least some diversity in the low rank , diversity in leadership be severely lack .
there be a clear focus on promote woman into positions_leadership position ( there be even a state goal for that ) but so far , that seem to be limit to Caucasian woman .
have be at <S-ORG> almost a decade , I can think of a single upper position_management position_management hold by a person of color .
advice : do more to make sure the culture and messaging come down from the top be actually implement throughout the company .
implement process that ensure all qualified employee have a fair shot at roles_leadership role or high - opportunities_visibility opportunity , and actively discourage the practice of preferential treatment base on personal connection .
if <S-ORG> be go to continue boast about its focus on diversity and inclusion , expand your definition of that term past just include_gender - include_gender person of vary ethnicity / color , and set goal accordingly .
otherwise , it feel very disingenuous .
pro :
as a whole , <S-ORG> be a great company to work for .
it successful and stable , the pay and benefit be competitive , and the corporate culture be extremely conducive to establish a long - career_term career_term with the company .
generally speak , once you at <S-ORG> and have establish yourself as a solid performer , the company make it relatively easy to explore other role in other area of the company , and many person take advantage of this flexibility and enjoy long and happy tenure with the company .
<S-ORG> be constantly change , which can be frustrating for some , but it definitely help keep thing interesting and be a necessary part of adapt to the need of the market .
the fact that our ceo openly encourage employee to submit <S-ORG> review say a lot about he .

despite grow revenue , everyone in the company suffer from " not enough resource " to do the job correctly .

unless you sit in <S-CARDINAL> of the <S-ORG> location , it hard to be hear , propose new idea , or take part in the design of thing .
advice : none pro : forward - organization_thinking organization_thinking , very data- and result - drive .
they have a lot of great initiative and campaign that keep employee feel connect and motivate .
they be also vocal in support social cause , such as autism and <S-NORP> , which make I very proud to work for they .
con :
if you be employ in a facing_customer face position that provide assistance_support and configuration assistance_support , then you will consistently be require to do more with less , and will be view as a necessary evil .
manager regularly refuse to allow employee to advance out of their role if they be see of immediate value in their current role .
advice : allow advancement_career advancement_career for all employee .
pro : the <S-ORG> product_SuccessFactors truly be amazing , customizable , and tightly integrate between module .
there be a host of talented and dedicated employee that be commit to the betterment of the customer and their goal .
con : - heavily underpaid .
as a engineer_software engineer_software , you will often make <B-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> below market , or in some case even more than that .
it also feel like <S-ORG> take advantage of person who can leave with their visa_work visa_work , they do have any position_bargain position_bargain .
with extraordinary performance ( when we still have rating ) , I do even get the regular <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> that everyone else get , only after explicitly ask for it .
- sapsv identity_SAPsv crisis_identity : pretty much every person I talk to at the <B-GPE> <E-GPE> location_Palo question what <S-ORG> do in <B-LOC> <E-LOC>
- prepare to be stick to your level_career level_career :
when we still have reviews_performance review , I have " extraordinary reviews_performance " a couple of time in a row .
now with <S-ORG> talk_SAP thing become very wishy washy .
I still get good feedback , but have see any action or tangible output .
my manager keep push thing out to " <B-DATE> <E-DATE> " .
not the manager fault though .
also , the curriculum I be interested in that would help I advance be unavailable in the area_bay area_bay , even though my manager support I in participate .
- process - Software engineering it a hell at <S-ORG> .
we have to use a lot of proprietary tool that do even get the job do , simply because some owners_process owner in <S-GPE> have too much power .
our team in particular waste <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of our resource to fit their processes_engineering process / tool and still build our own stuff in order to get the job do advice : - give we more valuable work in <B-LOC> <E-LOC> that fit <B-LOC> <E-LOC>
- make SAPsv a " research " , " startup " and " location_partnership " location_partnership primarily
- prevent good person from leave
- pay good salary to person who perform well pro : - friendly atmosphere , colleague
- empower to make my own decision
- they do a good job of hire young talent , excellent programs_internship program
con : be a remote employee have its disadvantage , at time you do feel a part of a team or the many activity they hold at corporate office .
invite be never make to local office , even to parties_holiday party or outing .
work hour can be long when issue arise and it expect you work , even on weekend and especially on weekends_release weekend .
career advancement_Career be very difficult to achieve unless you personally know someone , opportunity be not always give base on qualification and the internal posting_job posting_job process_posting be not consistent .
I personally apply for over <S-CARDINAL> internal position I be highly qualify for over <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> and be not offer <S-CARDINAL> position .
no feedback from recruiter or managers_hiring manager .
continue education_job education_job be hard to achieve due to constraints_time constraint during hours_work hour but with so many product that be support it be a must to keep up with product and change .
advice : career advancement_Career should be more achievable and die not always mean someone want to move into a role_mangement role_mangement .
too many internal re-org happen on a frequent basis , in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> I have have over <S-CARDINAL> manager , all the while in the same role , this be very difficult as not all manager speak with each other and performance wise you have to start back to square <S-CARDINAL> and again your advancement_career advancement_career discussion start all over again .
this make it very difficult to achieve personal paths_career path .
Real example_life example_life : recent change_re-org change_re-org I be in a role for over a year .
due to a reorganization they advise everyone in that role have to reapply for that role and or other role .
since I have already be do that role I reapply , interview internally and then be advise I be not be offer the role as other be more qualified ( even though I be already in that role and do the job for over a year ) come to find out <S-CARDINAL> person offer the role we not in the role previously as I have be , so decision be not always make that be fair and correct .
there be room for improvement with internal processes_hiring process .
pro : I a remote employee and I love it , this be on of reason I accept my offer from <S-ORG> <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
individual contributor have opportunity for <S-DATE> bonus base on performance as well as target determine by several factors_business factor .
each annual bonus I have receive be amazing and never disappoint !
<S-ORG> really care about their customer success and drive this throughout the organization .
con : <S-CARDINAL> . sometime , feel like too much process drive
<S-CARDINAL> should make all their team work more closely .
advice : stop do too frequent changes_org change .
pro : <S-CARDINAL> . have clear clear vision on future and take necessary step to realize their dream under the leadership of Mr. <B-PERSON> <E-PERSON> .
<S-CARDINAL> take care of employee very well , which inturn lead to excellent life_work - life_work balance_life .
<S-CARDINAL> . have great office with excellent class_world class_world facility
<S-CARDINAL> unlimited opportunities_learning and growth opportunity ( opportunities_learning new technology_learning be never stop in this company )
<S-CARDINAL> <S-ORG> policy_Opendoor , which allow person to speak openly about the issue and problem .
con : <S-CARDINAL> . risky proposition for <S-ORG> holder and Green aspirants_card aspirant - they will say they will process , but it will not go all the way to the end .
even <S-ORG> employee in senior role with <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> in the company have have to exit <S-GPE> due to issues_visa issue .
<S-CARDINAL> like in the case with many <S-NORP> company , the important / exiting / adding_value add work_adding be do in their <B-ORG> <E-ORG> ( <S-GPE> for <S-ORG> ) .
so , folk in <S-GPE> , <S-GPE> etc. be only give task that they do really care about , as it be not important .
<S-ORG> have a large workforce , but leadership be lack and be poorly manage as the ratio between leader and ' bees_worker - bee ' be bad .
for e.g. , if a <S-PERSON> person_Sr. in role_leadership role_leadership be good , he / she will have <S-CARDINAL> or more direct report and responsibility to manage <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> acquire company for that department .
so , due to this overburden , he / she will not be able to perform upto his ability .
in other word , ' good guy ' can perform due to over - burden and ' bad guy ' can perform , as do have the skill and experience .
advice : <S-CARDINAL> . drive accountability at a individual allocate_level - allocate_level area of responsibility for each person and set quarterly goal .
this be key to retain good talent .
<S-CARDINAL> do let manager and above ' shut off their engine ' and go into hibernation for <S-DATE> together !!
<S-CARDINAL> too many ' meetings_spectator meeting ' !!
- completely irrelevant meeting where we need to listen in mode_mute mode_mute ( like a spectator in a tennis match_Tennis ) to the leader give a speech .
<S-CARDINAL> meeting at <S-ORG> be like ' housewive chat for pass_time - pass_time ' - with no objective before the meeting and no up_conclusion / up_follow - up_conclusion after the meeting !!
moreover , due to lack of accountability , it be very difficult to identify the right manager / director in the meeting to take thing ahead .
<S-CARDINAL> focus on retain the exist good talent ( by improve on the points_pain point ) before hire again .
good talent will not stick around in such a environment for sure .
pro : <S-CARDINAL> . very stable company financially - unlike most startup and small companies_IT company , <S-ORG> have be profitable for <S-DATE> - this translate to ' no financial pinch ' for employee .
<S-CARDINAL> highly unlikely for <S-ORG> employee to be lay off or furlough due to <B-EVENT> <I-EVENT> <E-EVENT> or any other crisis .
<S-CARDINAL> highly unlikely to be for
ire for non-performance or poor performance .
but like any major company , they will do a major reorg <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> and at that time , even good performer will lose their job .
con :
while <S-ORG> as a company offer great benefit , the problem be within the <B-ORG> <E-ORG> division_Support .
person who may apply for support engineering_Support role_engineering should look elsewhere due to the reason below .
in product support there be <S-CARDINAL> main task ( i.e. could be inhumane too ) , that be so tough that it require you or force you to work night and weekend .
I) <S-ORDINAL> task : <B-WORK_OF_ART> <I-WORK_OF_ART> <I-WORK_OF_ART> <I-WORK_OF_ART> <E-WORK_OF_ART> .
why be this so tough ?
<S-ORDINAL> there be not a lot of person who may help here ( or it add a lot more work to your daily requirement ) .
if you somehow walk away to go to the bathroom or you be help other customer online , there would be a flag or a alarm to management that there be nobody man the chat ( or you be not man the chat ) .
this make employee start to feel anxious to the point that <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> become a very stressful environment ( i.e. unhealthy ) .
- if go to the bathroom give a stress_employee stress_employee then this be simply a requirement that be inhumane ( issue_HR issue_HR ) -
this make employee very stress to the point that they may quit the company ( which happen a lot in <S-ORG> ) -
turn over be pretty big -
this task also add to the overwhelming number of requirement that the engineer_support engineer_support need to do daily -
this be also go to be record in a report that be available to management - how long do you logon to Chat ?
they can use this number against you .
for example :
if the engineer_support engineer_support need to help <S-CARDINAL> different customer daily with their issue technically that may last <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> each ( in a session_web session_web call_session or deep session_dive session_web ) , this chat ( i.e. you may get between <S-CARDINAL> to <B-QUANTITY> <E-QUANTITY> per day ) will add another <B-QUANTITY> <E-QUANTITY> to <B-TIME> <E-TIME> each on top of the already schedule <S-CARDINAL> customer ( <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> ) .
this will either push other important satisfaction_customer aside for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> ( low satisfaction_customer satisfaction_customer ) or would make the engineer_support engineer_support work beyond normal hours_working hour to fulfill the requirement .
<S-ORG> be wonder why they be not get high score in <B-ORG> <E-ORG> , it could be that the process they place could be stress their employee to be the good they could be .
if you do this <S-DATE> , you would have tired and highly stress engineers_support engineer which will then be burn out .
this may show up in our satisfaction_customer satisfaction_customer result as your engineer be not fully rest and can only give <B-TIME> <E-TIME> to each new satisfaction_customer ( i.e. pong_ping pong_ping effect_pong ) .
II ) <S-ORDINAL> Task : you be also require to work night and weekend ( <S-DATE> and <S-DATE> ) .
this be one of the hard one that be give to any engineer_support engineer_support .
yes they may ask you to take some other day off or may even give you money but it also take away the most important thing a person need and that be time with family and time to recharge oneself .
we can argue that the chat + support_weekend support_weekend make a engineer life_engineers hard .
wait till you miss a call or work during the weekend , this be where you would feel what hell be like at work .
this <S-CARDINAL> task from support_product support_product be one of the most challenging thing to swallow ( your mindset need to be a zombie ) .
if give the opportunity to work for another company or division in <S-ORG> that do not have this requirement , I would say sign I up immediately !
last issue be as soon as you get to a particular level , there be no more growth .
you have max out .
your contain within your level per limitation_budget limitation_budget .
if you can work in <S-ORG> in another division , that be good .
within product support , it be tough .
advice : proposal :
<S-CARDINAL> ) to help alleviate the overtime_work overtime_work due to the <S-CARDINAL> issue :
a ) for support have a specific role ( or hire a role ) that would be call : emergency weekend_Emergency and response_holiday technical response_holiday team_response .
they work <S-DATE> to <S-DATE> or <S-DATE> to <S-DATE> regularly ( + holiday ) .
that be part of the requirement_job requirement_job .
so person look to work on the weekend due to they have obligations_family obligation ( like take care of their kid on weekday ) , can apply or open it up to <S-ORG> who have schooling on the weekday .
billion ) for <B-ORG> <E-ORG> , have a role that only specialize in <B-ORG> <E-ORG> and online_SAP online_SAP community_Chat without the need to handle handling_incident handling_incident while person work on handling_incident handling_incident can free up the time to work on the real handling_incident instead of push other incidents_customer handling_incident aside .
this would help strengthen another lackluster part of <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> that be highly missing as state by our <S-ORG> mentor ( i.e. miss online community ) .
even the past ceo <B-PERSON> <E-PERSON> say he would do something about it however , it be still miss up to this point ( <B-ORG> <E-ORG> still need to improve here ) .
this <S-CARDINAL> suggestion will help alleviate the stress attain by your engineers_support engineer .
without some alleviation , the behavior of your team will simply look to find a job elsewhere then you would lose your sets_skill set or trust advisor for other to attain .
without the <S-CARDINAL> issue in con or if the proposal to management on how to alleviate and improve our channel_chat / online channel_chat be do , I would mark this review as <S-CARDINAL> star instead .
pro : <S-ORG> in General be a good company with wonderful benefit .
it give the employee room to grow and give they wonderful extra time to help your family cope with any trouble in life .
<S-ORG> also try to fulfill good in salary_employment salary_employment and structures_bonus structure .

con : still a lot of code_legacy code_legacy that can be difficult to maintain .
sometimes the small office do not abide by a few of the more generous policy the company_parent company_parent have in place .
sometimes the operation team_operations in the datacenter be not very responsive , make it difficult to resolve live issues_customer issue .
advice : continue the push to the cloud , give the developer good access to the operation team_operations in the datum center to help resolve issue more quickly .
pro : change technology , dedication to continue education through class_company class_company offering and external resource , stable establish class_company with a eye towards the future .

pro : strong business , financially sound , with great opportunities_career opportunity for growth .
multinational with many market / industry / solution .
excellent " high program_potential " program_potential to nurture top talent .
con :
it be a large company , that work with other large organization so there will be complexity .
need a little more marketing to let other company know we be more than just <S-ORG> .
advice : keep care about the employee , the rest will fall into place .
pro :

decent work / balance_life balance_life .
compensation be above average for my field
con : since <S-ORG> make a lot of money , all other team only try to make fancy product without generate revenue .
a lot of recent manager be push to release product not for generate money from customer but get credit for promotion .
advice : hire smart , diligent person with high compensation instead of hire more mediocre person with cheap salary .
check manager performance be not base on how fast the product be release but how good the product be .
pro : Stable business_enterprise business_enterprise orient .

as any large company , you have to navigate through multiple layer of process to get thing do .
but leadership seem genuinely committed to our " run simple " motto .
thing be improve every day .
advice : none pro :

I surround by smart , articulate , engage colleague who seem to really want to make a impact here .
great place to balance_work - great balance_work / balance_life balance_work , as many role can be do virtually .
con : reorganization do not always seem to be for the good of the employee .
various level of upper management can be out of touch at time , in large corporation , in general .
advice : get feedback from technical groups_employee group , treat they as equal to the groups_marketing group , and actually use the feedback in to improve situation .
make it a priority to give employees_consulting employee training in the new product , service , etc. , before train all the partner and push work to they .
pro : good co-worker , network of expert and online resource that be available to assist you with instruction , information , advice , etc. !!
con :
as with any very large organization , their be many resource and lot of information .
information overload_Information can get hard to manage and organize .
but well too much than not enough .
advice : keep do what you be do !
pro : <S-ORG> be commit to truly help their customer achieve their bus
objectives_iness objective .
they continue to innovate each and every day and be focus on build solutions_business solution for the future .
they empower their workforce to think outside the box , they respect the ability to balance work and personal need and trust their employee to get the job do .
con : customer face position can be high stress since you the face of <S-ORG> and you deal with decision that cost <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> and can make or break the customer company financially .
you have to continually study and add to your body of knowledge as new information become available on a almost daily basis .
you have to continually increase your sets_skill set to remain relevant .
this be not a job , it a lifestyle .
if you do approach it that way , you burn out quickly .
the advantage of <S-ORG> be the ( earn ) perception that customer have about the quality of our employee .
the disadvantage be that you have to live up to that perception every minute you in front of the customer .
if you look for a <S-CARDINAL> to <S-CARDINAL> job with very specifically define , repeatable task , <S-ORG> be probably not for you .
advice : none pro : I work in a facing_customer face position at <S-ORG> .
I have have the opportunity to work with <B-ORG> <E-ORG> company , small company , public entities_sector entity and everything in between .
the reputation of <S-ORG> give I instant credibility with the customer as the representative_vendor representative_vendor .
I have the opportunity to develop a trust relationship_advisor relationship_advisor with my customer and work with they on projects_business critical project ; give direction , provide leadership and support as they implement <S-ORG> products_software product across their company .
it easy to maintain and build that credibility with the wealth of documentation and support_colleague support_colleague .
I be able to find answer to questions_product question and develop solution to challenges_implementation challenge know I can count on other colleague across the company support I .
<S-ORG> give I the opportunity to do what I love to do every day at customer around the world that I would never have the opportunity to touch otherwise .
I have the freedom to assume as much responsibility as I wish and rise as high in the company as I be able .
expertise , hard work and result be generously reward base on my ability .
con : large business complexity : the entrepreneurial spirit be real , but <S-ORG> still be a large enterprise , with a broad portfolio of software and there just a layer ( or layer ) of complexity that unavoidable .
approval be layer and thing do move as fast as you want / should .
no bad than other place , good than many .
re - org : all company in tech go through reorganization more frequently than company in traditional field like manufacturing , but <S-ORG> be somewhat know for move team and organization around fast than average .
depend on your role in the company , you could have a new focus in your job <B-DATE> <E-DATE> without actually move to a new team .
if you hate change and have to constantly learn new thing , this will be challenging for you .
but if you get bored easily , this could be a positive even if it can be frustrating .
advice : keep do what you do - and keep rewarding innovation , simplification , and common sense .
pro : career flexibility : I start my career in pre-sale , move to development_product development_product , and look for a new challenge , I reinvent my career in marketing .
I can imagine another company where I have be able to reboot my career * with support from management * as I have here .
collaborative culture : the level of collaboration here be really amazing .
talk to <S-ORG> and the most common " plus " you hear about the company be " the person " ...
can find information you look for ?
send a email to someone you do know who have that keyword in their profile , and no matter where in the world they be , they go to help you or help you find someone with the information .
I never have someone say to I " that not my job " .
it amazing .
and uncommon .
entrepreney spirit : <S-ORG> be big , but everyone I talk to agree the thing we love be the way you can mold your role / job and career here - and if you decide you want to leave to try something different or you take a break from work to take care of family , and want to come back to <S-ORG> you find that additional experience view as a positive ( and in the case of a break to care for child / family , you will find support for your re-entry ) .
that say , if you be someone who want a job that highly - direct ( strong oversight , active management by your boss on a basis_day to basis_day basis_day with daily feedback / input ) this be not go to be a place for you in most case .
this be a highly - independent environment_work environment_work in the vast majority of case .
culture : I go to sound marketing -y for a minute , but imagine work for a company that be <B-ORG> <E-ORG> ( lead certification_business certification_business for equality_gender equality_gender ) , have a global tech diversity &amp_Diversity ; inclusion team_Inclusion , have office and customer in ~ <S-CARDINAL> country ; have a major <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> organization_Responsibility that coordinate activities_volunteer for activities_service activity , and during <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> offer pay time off to participate in activities_volunteer activity ; and matching_donation - matching_donation be offer .
<S-ORG> have be in leader_industry leader_industry since <S-DATE> deliver <B-EVENT> <I-EVENT> <I-EVENT> <I-EVENT> <I-EVENT> <E-EVENT> which consider the corporate impact on the environment and our sustainability , to use a holistic view of our total impact beyond finances as our measure of success each year .

inter- cultural training be provide to help team in different country understand how to work and communicate more effectively with each other .
this be not about political correctness ; it about be respectful of other culture and different point of view , even if you have different belief .
GLOBAL reach /IMPACT :
if you eat it , drink it , drive it , wear it , or use it in your daily life , our customer probably make it .
e.g. , <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of the world supply_food supply_food be deliver by <S-ORG> customer ( include <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of the world supply_chocolate supply_food , and <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of the world beer ) .
that be incredible - but it also be a key reason our board and ceo have a mission to " help the world run good and improve person life " .
if your company touch <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of financial transaction that happen <S-DATE> , globally , you have a opportunity and a responsibility to think about how that reach can benefit person - not just ourselves .
a lot of person struggle want to work somewhere that make a difference - I find work at <S-ORG> I have a long - career_term career_term where I do make a difference , in way that I can imagine other company could .
very cool .
support to innovate &amp ; take risk : the ceo say " tell it like it be " and take inform risk and as far as I see , this be support ( standard caveat of , " when it do in a constructive , and respectful way " .
this may partly be a function of <S-NORP> culture_work culture_work , but I find the openness here refresh compare with friend experience .
PURPOSE-DRIVEN : SAP mission for year be " help the world run good and improve person life " .
this be our mission before it be ' cool ' .
this be our mission before term like ' green - washing ' and ' signaling_virtue - signal ' come into mainstream conversation .
we have have <S-ORG> program for <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> ; we have have programs_sustainability program for at least a decade ; we have excellent benefit like pay parental leave_bereavement for adoption , pay leave_bereavement leave_bereavement ( immediate family ) , affordable healthcare , pay days_vacation start at 3 wks ( sick day be separate from days_vacation day ) , subsidize public transportation , and our large office there be cafeterias_employee cafeteria where you can get subsidize lunch ( hot food_style , not just deli- food_style food_style ) , source locally when possible , and with vegetarian and vegan option .
training &amp_TRAINING ; career support : a robust program for grow within the company mean once you join <S-ORG> , you can do a wide range of job and change career - as I do - multiple time without leave the company .
I personally attribute this to the <S-NORP> model_business model_business , which bring in young talent and nurture it , versus the typical <S-NORP> model_business where recruiter look for exist - employ individual and attempt to hire they away .
this model mean a lot of person stay at <S-ORG> for a long time compare to other companies_tech company - but the ability to move around within the company and try different job keep your career fresh and interesting .
there be formal and informal training_job training_job program , formal mentoring and coaching program , internal recruiter to help person move around , and - one of the good thing - opportunity to work in other country for short assignments_term or permanent assignment , with the most opportunity in <S-LOC> , <S-LOC> , and <B-LOC> <E-LOC> .
con : work / balance_life balance_Work can be a issue ( particularly in nation without protective laws_worker law ) , and ancillary benefit be not always consistent from region to region .
some of this be to be expect .
a unfortunate effect_side effect_side of a large company , like <S-ORG> , be that that willfully ineffective person have a ability to hang around far long than they should .
they tend to hide in different department or act as barrier to progress .
again , not a stopper_show stopper_show ... but at time it can be a annoying impediment .
additionally , there be not enough visibility on the quality of individual ( name ) leader .
this individual can either positively or ( severely ) negatively impact the quality , moral , and retention of great employee - thus , valuable talent depart ( good leader or good teammate under poor leader ) before it can be recognize .
the <S-CARDINAL> con that many of we have not yet learn to overcome be this :
if you be not in proximity to
the global headquarters , it be hard to get recognize and there be a bit of a ceiling_glass ceiling_glass on your upward mobility .
there be few true opportunities_growth opportunity .
this mean many person end up depart for other green field in a effort to advance their career and ambition .
<S-ORG> would do well to independently review their person survey and outcome for hidden talent in other region .
advice : pay more attention to other region .
do independent dive to identify talent , and to see who be perform strongly , and who be not .
consider all factor , upstream and downstream .
continue to be person centric overall .
<S-ORG> be a great place to work and create , however , it need to be foster and not forget .
pro :
the benefit be competitive , compensation be pretty good , there be always challenge for that who seek they , there be opportunity_growth opportunity_growth , and there be always a ability to learn something .
<S-ORG> take care of their employee ( generally speak ) with the understanding that we will pay it back in kind .
I , and other , have be very fortunate to always have opportunity at our doorstep .
technology and solution challenge be plenty , as there be always something to do .
<B-PERSON> <E-PERSON> be brilliant ...
one could argue he become sole ceo too early , but that argument would be severely flawed .
he have a solid field of recognition and a strong grasp on what person in the company be do .
he a financial wizard_financials , but he keep his heart very close to the technology .
he a absolute star_rock star_rock in the making .
con :
a lot of optional benefit you can take advantage of at <S-ORG> , like benefits_tuition benefit , fellowship , etc. , be all determine by your direct manager approval .
this be extremely disadvantageous to that of we at <S-ORG> with manager that do believe in this opportunity and do want to use any of their budget for this item .
more importantly , your ability to move up in your career be determine by your direct manager , and this be a extreme disadvantage with some of the manager they hire .
also , it be very difficult to get fire from <S-ORG> , which mean that poor performer at both level_management - level_management and individual contributor get shuffle around to new group rather than get let go , which bring down all of <S-ORG> with their low standard .
advice : keep be a leader among all other company in your response to the crisis that affect your employee around the world .
keep do the right thing when it come to your employee .
please remove some of the complete power over our career and opportunity from our direct manager .
there should be some check and balance for direct manager on their approval and rejection , promotion , etc. .
<S-CARDINAL> bad manager_apple manager_apple can ruin the <S-ORG> experience_SAP for a whole team of employee .
pro :
so many pro -- the pay , benefit , time_vacation time_vacation , work / balance_life balance_life , parental leave .
High up at <S-ORG> really do care about our wellbeing .
SAP response to the <B-EVENT> <I-EVENT> <E-EVENT> crisis_COVID be phenomenal and show great leadership .
they immediately close all their office and centers_training center and shut down all non-essential travel .
they send free mask to all their employee , and give we all a extra day off to get out of our offices_home office .
although in some case , <S-ORG> be know for old technology and interface , that be often the case anymore , and you can join a work_group work_group on cut technologies_edge technology .
<S-ORG> do a great job promote internally and allow employee to move around to different role and position while stay within the company .
if I ever decide to change my role , I know that I want to stay with <S-ORG> .
con :
not locate close enough to a major city .
it would be nice if their office be in <S-GPE> , but they in the suburb .
not very close to anything interesting .
advice : listen to your user .
many small business seem to have trouble adapt even with training .
what be keep they from use their <S-ORG> platform_SAP to its full potential ?
pro : strong campus_company , beautiful campus_company , treat employee very well .
<S-ORG> employee ( but not contractor ) get a decent per diem for lunch in the cafe , which incidentally have good food and alot of variety .
con :
in the sale side_sales , the big negative to work here be that the company change their strategy yearly , which be terribly odd execpt that it usually mean you be in a different role in a different territory from <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
the exception be if you be high field_level field_level AE_field .
this mean you have <B-DATE> <E-DATE> to make hey because you know you be do something different come <S-DATE> .
also , do plan on take vacation in sale during <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> , especially right at <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> .
that when all the big deal close .
as a Inside sale person_sales , there also only so much affect you can have on a large deal .
due to the way the organization_sale organization_sale be structure , a <S-ORG> partner_SAP be involve as well as a <S-ORG> person_feild person_SAP , which can often reduce your role on large deal to admin and report guy .
advice : stop change everyone role every year .
it make we myopic in our sale strategy_sales .
pro :
the company really do take care of it person .
even if they have some massive shift in strategy , I have to admit they do a good job of try to shift people role instead of just let they go .
they also offer a decent strategy_severence strategy_severence to give you time to find another role inside the company if they do let you go .
the benefit be good .
the person be usually the good of the good and be very helpful .
there be some attitude and ego but most person be great to work with .
there be ton of opportunity to advance here and it encourage .
<S-ORG> be also a great experience_career experience_career and you become a valuable commodity after <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> in sale .
con :
there be way too many exercises_reorganization exercise .
even when you not directly impact , you be <B-QUANTITY> <E-QUANTITY> of separation from someone who be and the morale_culture / work morale_culture can be tax .
Communication from the " trench " seem to lose meaning as it get push up to upper management ... like the game_telephone game_telephone .
advice : none pro :
the company be large which provide a lot of good opportunity and the focus on social responsibility be pretty inspiring .
Communication push down from top be usually clear and consistent across organization .
con : deal with inefficiency , bureaucracy , person that want to retire and not bring new idea or support .
due to the transition to the cloud prepare to deal with person that take credit for your idea advice : create a more inclusive multi-generation environment , avoid impact on people_talent person during the transition to the cloud , invest on the new leader and person that manage team .
pro : work and collaborate with talent , innovative person globally .
be aware of the trend that be happen , participate on Interesting project that be impact the trend in the market .
con :
because it be such a large company , there be small group that be lose in the shuffle because they be only a blip on the radar .
as such resourcing and budgeting can be a big challenge .
advice : the person matter and be what make the company a good company .
without the person support process , develop , and sell , the good product in the world will mean nothing .
pro : very good overall company .
the executive board have a good plan and be execute against that plan .
benefit be good and compensation seem to be competitive with the local market .
con : <S-ORG> be still try to change itself into <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> power by <B-ORG> <E-ORG> .
as much as we like to be , be not a default_start default_up - by default_start , as we have <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> employee .
some old folk be still stuck in the " old way of do thing " advice : embrace change .
focus on millennial .
be a champion for your employee success .
support the person below you .
do all this would be a recipe for success .
pro : <S-ORG> be great company .
<B-ORG> <E-ORG> with a compelling story to tell our customer .
hard - working , humble employee all around .
highly recommend
con :
the suite of offering ( both software and service ) be very complex and seem to be in a constant state of change .
this make it very difficult for a single individual to explain thing to customer , and as a result , the team_account team_account become a small army of resource - each one specialize in <S-CARDINAL> small niche of the overall solution .
ask <S-CARDINAL> different resource to define something as heavily market as <S-ORG> , and you be likely to get a good <S-CARDINAL> or <S-CARDINAL> entirely different response .
I always surprised when I read other person list balance_work / life balance_work as one of the " pro " of balance_work at <S-ORG> .
I work weekend and vacation just to keep up because of either unrealistic expectation or deal with the add time require to work through the red tape that be require to do one job .
every request_vacation request_vacation be challenge by my manager even though I have earn the time off , and I painfully recollect time when I be stare out at the ocean from my room_hotel room_hotel while I be on a mandatory call_conference call_conference .
maybe it be just the team that I be on , but I find management to be aloof and ish_clique - ish_clique .
a lot of management by intimidation , and then that same manager wonder why you do reach out to they more often .
the reality be that they ( the manager ) be under constant pressure and it all flow downstream .
advice : simplify the offering , service and strategy so that person have a simple and concise story to tell their customer .
be more approachable and mingle with your entire team as oppose to the <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> person that you clearly like more than everyone else .
pro : erp software_ERP still good in class ; development come up with some very innovative / solid solution ; great opportunity to work with highly intelligent and drive person
con : large bureaucratic organization that be highly resistant to change despite increase competitive pressure and crack in_lock loyalty_customer loyalty_customer ( in_lock - in_lock ) <S-ORG> have
rely on for <S-DATE> .
advice : spend more time focus externally on dynamics_market dynamic and needs_customer need rather than bolster traditional innovation_product and antiquated sale and innovation_product innovation_product models_operating model .
pro : a lead brand in the industry_tech industry_tech with broad and truly global reach .
large install base that have become dependent upon <S-ORG> for most of its infrastructure .
some savvy acquisition in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> give the company the potential to pivot to regain its fast - wane leadership in the space_tech space_tech .
con : outsourcing of technical support to <S-LOC> in a follow the mode_sun mode_sun , do work .
customer frustrated and angry with have to explain thing <S-CARDINAL> time .
price go up , but feature not so much .
want to be a <S-ORG> company_SaaS but too much old erp baggage_ERP .
Upper middle management too worried about how they look and not treat person well .
advice : none pro : absolutely the good product for erp on the market and <S-ORG> be the app_killer app_killer .
top leadership gift and visionary and person work hard .

the office be nice and the company provide many opportunities_learning opportunity for its employee .
the company also have a great life_work life_work balance_life and there be numerous opportunity to move within the company .
Leadership be also very transparent with the direction and strategy of the company .
con : I work on the facing_client - face side_delivery side_delivery and the work be intense .
there be a lot of travel and to succeed at <S-ORG> you have to work hard .
there be much life_work - life_work balance_life and you do have to life_work through a maze of complexity in order to do thing ( lot of step , rule , etc. ) .
it a good company but you have to learn how to navigate it .
advice : none pro : <S-ORG> be very supportive of their employee - there be regular opportunities_training opportunity and movement throughout the organization be encourage .
the pay be solid and they reward employee who work hard .
con :
we get $ <S-MONEY> each day for lunch ... why not $ <S-MONEY> ?

I get my work do when I do and no one bother I .
the work be interesting and definitely busy .
travel around the world be a perk .
I also love the opportunities_volunteer opportunity as philanthropy be important to I .
con : end of year review be not truly " pay for performance " but be instead " pay if your mates_team mate do perform " advice : give manager a little more room_wiggle room_wiggle -- current forces_process force manager with a mates_team of all top performer to give <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> across the board even if the a mates_team member_team go above and beyond .
some manager literally hire under-performer to reallocate the pool -- which create a more difficult environment_work environment_work .

con : training budget_Training have be drastically cut .
we just to have a lot more opportunities_training opportunity and budget for real room_class room_class opportunities_training that allow hand on experience and not poor materials_quality materials_text materials_reading material that we get now .
advice : not to be racist , but the demographics at <S-ORG> have shift tremendously to <S-GPE> and what we just to do , it be be do by <S-CARDINAL> <S-NORP> instead of <S-CARDINAL> of we .
we still have some good resource in our <S-NORP> University that be from other country .
pro : great benefit , care_health care_health , vacation , and cafeteria .
con : Recent changes_leadership change bring about minor change in direction and focus , but the vision will be clear and motivate advice : none pro :
not only do this customer fully live and breathe for its customer , but it also take care of its employee .
<S-ORG> be huge , with <B-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> employee around the globe , yet you feel " in the know " and well take care of .

<S-ORG> have not a brilliant history in manage acquisition pro : great benefit and employee networking_employees be very helpful and all what you need be to ask for help from a colleague .
con :
too much talk and not enough action .
frequent change in direction .
frequent re-org .
management career_Management very limit outside <S-GPE> .
control on everything almost exclusively in <S-GPE> and expect other to just be puppet .
advice : if you consider yourself a global company then act like one .
do be too <S-NORP> - centric and do consider external site such as <S-GPE> campuse a threat .
you try to promote innovation but at the same time you stifle it just because it come from outside <S-GPE> .

con : suffocation of nightmare_acronym to a point where person stop ask what they reference and the meaning behind the message ; new employee be lose and veteran employee " should know " so neither dare ask the meaning of a nightmare_acronym ; it be the silent epidemic in the company advice : keep do what you be do ; get tough on poor manager so you continue to have strong leadership ; stop the nightmare_acronym nightmare_acronym .

con : <S-PERSON> organization
lot of incapable leader ( all be at the company long enough to get a title_leadership title_leadership )
no room for growth ( <S-CARDINAL> freezes_hiring freeze in a row )
processes_HR process ( be pay for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> when I <S-ORDINAL> start ) advice : start hire more young person ASAP , develop that young person and do some clean up with some of your leader

advice : none pro : incredible culture_company culture_company , life_work life_work balance_life , the job itself be great .
finally , a company truly focus on support your life and make the career a part of that life , and not the other way around .
I can say enough positive thing about this company .
everyone here at <B-ORG> <E-ORG> be try to refer friend in .
SAP - do change , you do great !
con : - training : almost all training be do online now and everyone know the quality and effectiveness of online training ...
- lack of technical training : there be soooo many different type of support_customer support_customer / teams_enablement team and no one have really any technical or functional knowledge of the product .
- work life balance in consulting :
it great that the executive preach about balance_work balance_life balance_work , but everyone know in consulting , that do necessarily exist if you balance_work for a large , strategic customer with unrealistic timeline
- sale vs. professional service : conflict kpi within this org cause lot of headbutting and undercutting .
I can tell you how many time sale person have sell / promise something that do exist without talk to product and then they just dump it on the consultant after the deal be sign and they get their comp .
- shortcomings_product : lot of shortcomings_product shortcoming .
it extremely frustrating to be work on strategic account and implement a resources_product that have lot of room for improvement , but <S-ORG> have lay off resources_product resource to hire more enablement_customer enablement_customer person that sit around and blow smoke .
advice : <S-CARDINAL> ) spend money on training your resource .
I work directly with customer and I never be train on the product - I just pick thing up as I go .
I be also hire right out of college and I never be properly train on my role .
I get throw to the wolf on every project and it extremely stressful , demoralizing , and demotivate .
additionally , this be not a good look to our customer
<S-CARDINAL> ) hire technical person that know how to fix the problem rather than a bunch of team that want to know what go on but offer no real support to you or the customer .
remember , you be a company_software company_software .
customer expect all of our product to deliver and if they do , they want to partner with we to build what their industry need .
<S-CARDINAL> ) to down all the buzzword like " upgrade to success " and " center of excellence " .
I do have time to decode what this initiative mean or what this team do .
just be real and get do what need to get do .
not everything need
to be so flashy .
pro : - benefit : 401k , great insurance_health insurance_health plan , plans_employee plans_stock plan
- days_vacation day : be here for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> and I have <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> which be pretty decent .
- work from Home : depend on the team , but it very common here and most manager be very flex with this .
- opportunity for growth : lot of opportunity for growth
- cool event :
they throw some cool party if you near a office .
holiday party and <B-EVENT> <E-EVENT> be pretty fun and they really go all out with the event .
they also bring in awesome speakers_guest speaker like <B-PERSON> <E-PERSON> , <B-PERSON> <E-PERSON> , <B-PERSON> <E-PERSON> , etc. and I really look forward to this
con : saddle with <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> of what be now technical debt that they do want to deal with .
large portion of the workforce be unwilling ( and can be compel ) to learn new skill or technology
management be more concerned with person get along and make their number than actually make strategic decision .
below average pay in the <S-GPE> ( even though the <S-NORP> think <S-GPE> employee be pay too much ) advice : move headquarters to the <S-GPE> and act like a company_tech company_tech .
do be afraid to make big decision , even if that have implication on the workforce .
provide opportunity for your employee to learn new technical skill and incentivize they to do so .
pro : good work / balance_life balance_life
a few really smart person with great idea

advice : this review have be remove from this site in order to comply with local regulations_content regulation .
pro :
this review have be remove from this site in order to comply with local regulations_content regulation .
con :
there never seem to be a ' button_off ' button_off , and it feel this way especially since <S-EVENT> come around .
I never feel more stress out to hit a number or micro-managed in my many , many year of sale .
it <S-CARDINAL> thing to understand and adjust to what the business need , but even when new objective be communicate , there still seem to be a lack of alignment with our direct sell counterpart ( a majority that I meet be outside hire that do fully understand what <B-ORG> <E-ORG> purpose within <S-ORG> be . )
after work with past <S-ORG> employee and hear what it use to be like , I fear that <S-PERSON> still hone the atmosphere_fraternity / good boys_ole boy club_boys atmosphere_fraternity .
while it certainly appear to have improve , that aura still linger above we and it can be feel on a daily basis .
management do everything they can to support ' under'performer , however many peer be as generous .
I see a couple person leave because of that lack of camaraderie or inclusion .
this job be easy by any means but this condition make it a lot hard , and I can understand why there appear to be a fast door_revolving door_revolving here compare to other <S-ORG> inside sale org .
advice : no survey should ask for a name , ever .
the world <S-DATE> be so different and the fear of provide honest feedback while have your name tie to it be very real .
onboarding be and still be incredible .
I know a lot of work have be do for <S-ORG> when start , especially with the large class , to create equal opportunity when it come time for the promotion to OB .
keep that up .
pro : entire organization be very interactive and ( mostly ) inclusive .
I never know a sale organization_sales to have dedicate sale coach and managers_program manager specifically for roles_market / sale / development_business development_business type_development role , and that type_development of support go a long way .
the high achiever be players_team player and be always willing / able to share what work well for they , both on a personal basis and on large calls_group call .
majority of management have do this role before , which you do see too often .
if they have , they listen to their employee to understand exactly what we do , and go out of their way to constructively coach .
be back by the <S-ORG> name_SAP be very powerful , but <S-ORG> still have its own culture .
that feeling of independence go a long way .
con :
if you be a <S-GPE> employee_U.S. and not a citizen , rely on visa to legally work , it really difficult to grow here since lot of managers_hiring manager do not want to deal with the administrative overhead of handle visa and the process , you will not be able to move within the company as freely as a citizen would .
this limit your potential_growth potential_growth .
if you want to gain global exposure or want to move to different country to continue your growth to avoid the constant anxiety around <S-GPE> process_visa process_U.S. , you have to deal with the global bureacracies_mobility bureacracy , <S-ORG> have make the already difficult international transfer impossible , it require level_board level_board approval_level to move between country , <S-ORG> tout the simple_run simple_run mantra , there one for simple_run simple_run .
if nobody but board could take decision on a international transfer , you can understand how bureacratic the process be here .
diversity -
if you look up the <S-FAC> , L2 and <S-ORG> leader in <S-ORG> , you can figure out how much diversity_gender be respect in senior level_leadership , it only at individual level_contributor level_contributor and diversity_gender diversity_gender at level_leadership level_contributor , you should start empowering person from different ethnic group .
advice : simplify global process_mobility process_mobility , pandemic have prove that you can operate from anywhere in the world .
for some trap in the <S-GPE> processes_visa process , it may be a huge relief to travel to another country like <S-GPE> , <S-GPE> or <S-GPE> which offer similar standard of living without clipe your wing .
focus on offer executive and senior opportunities_leadership opportunity to person from different group , especially in <B-LOC> <E-LOC> , regardless of the tenture , you hit a ceiling after you reach <S-ORG> opportunities_leadership .
if <B-ORG> <E-ORG> be the future , please make it apparent and cross-train person with other backgrounds_technology background in <B-LOC> <E-LOC> , messaging be as clear as mud on the future direction for employee .
pro : great balance_work balance_life balance_work , everybody try to make sure employee be happy though leader be limit by the framework on what they can reward to employee .
process_Leadership process_survey process_Leadership make sure employee be take care of and their need be fullfill .
performance base awards_stock award , medical benefit , time away from work , paternity and leaves_maternity leave ( <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> plus )
you be mostly reward base on performance and at time base on relationship
con : - Middle management be often see competent_in mode_panic mode_panic and be competent_in - competent_in , lack simple making_decision making_decision ability .
I have see small decision move around from <B-ORG> <E-ORG> team_CTO , to product team_CTO , to <S-ORG> team_CTO and feel like person either lack in power to say yes / no or be simply incompetent to run business .
and I work in a team which interact with almost all units_business unit , I have see this problem all across <S-ORG> .
- <S-ORG> pay very very less compare to other company in area_bay area_bay .
salary in <S-GPE> region_SF be comparatively high , that a know fact , but even compare to the competition and their partner in <B-GPE> <E-GPE> / <B-LOC> <E-LOC> .
<S-ORG> pay <B-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> less than <S-ORG> , <S-ORG> , <S-ORG> , <S-ORG> , even less their immediate neighbor , <S-ORG> .
- another big con , lot of promotion happen in the level_T4 level_T4 , while person in <S-FAC> and T3 be struggle to prove their worth to their manager .
I have see very worthy person deny of promotion , while their middle management take credit the work climb up the ladder very quickly .
for all this reason , I have see very smart person frustrated and look out for opportunity outside every now and then .
advice : this advice be for the middle management only , especially t4s and probably <B-PRODUCT> <E-PRODUCT> .
- value your team and strength of person who be make you successful .
- lead they to success .
be a leader rather than a manager who be just worried about meet deadlines_project deadline .
- promote the person who deserve credit for their yearly hard work and let they take extra responsibility and move further in their career .
- do not make fake promise on <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , you will be risk to lose lot of good talent to your competitor .
<B-ORG> <I-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> know where its go .
<S-DATE> goals_business goal be very clear and to the point .
Main focus be on the integration between multiple units_business unit and their product
- Products_SAP product be awesome and stand up to their vision to run the world good
- Diverse culture , lot of wonderful person
- opinion be value and respect .
con : right now , the SAP I love look very different .
from my perspective , global leadership attitude have be essentially , " shut up and do what I say . "
they do understand or care about how our internal process work .
they force we to roll out solution that be ready for customer , or solution that customer do even want .
in order to meet their deadline , we have to implement complex manual workaround to get the job halfway finish .
to be fair to current global leadership , SAP process be complicated before .
unfortunately , sell have always be the primary goal .
we have a poor record_track record_track of actually deliver service_quality service_quality .
but the current pressure we face be make thing bad .
add all of the complications_COVID complication , and now you have a place that really be fun to work .
though <S-ORG> pledge of inclusion be admirable , it be not always practice .
hiring practice can be elitist .
to be frank , leadership be primarily white man and high Indian_caste <S-NORP> man .
our current board be all white , mostly <S-NORP> , and only have <S-CARDINAL> woman ( there will be <S-CARDINAL> when <S-DATE> start ) .
our <S-ORDINAL> female co- ceo — a loyal , beloved member of <S-ORG> — " part way " with the company <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> after she be appoint .
overall , I be disappointed in the current state of the company .
I think it have potential to be a great company , but not with the current person in charge .
if you want to make the company a good place to work , then please join we .
if you just look for a job , I recommend look else
where .

pro : good pay , great benefit , balance_work balance_life balance_work be fantastic , strategy be solid , management be engage and inciteful , workforce be intelligent and resourceful .
con : Communication : you do know of change before they be put in effect .
Communication with manager be terrible .
it be never a open forum .
when you bring up example of something - they will ask ' who say that ' or ask for specific name .
so there a lot of finger point and blame .
the lack of communication be comical at time .
every bit of information I learn about when person be be hire , when person be move to other department , any change at all have be from a colleague .
sound like a mill_rumor mill_rumor because it be .
and it be that they be wait to finalize thing , we just never hear anything from management .
silence .
role / promotion : role work in whatever way allow management to favor who they want while not pay person for the work they do .
promotion be base on a arbitrary and subjective list of attribute of the employee , but even if you '' check all the box '' promotion be seemingly only possible once a year so be prepare to be tell <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> that you will be promote in <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> until <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> go by .
move from desk_help desk_help to <S-ORG> support_PMO should be a change_title change_title - its different work , more difficult , deserve of a change_pay change_title .
it be incredibly frustrating do the exact same work as a colleague but know they have a different title and be be pay more for their work .
if the manager really love you , ( mean that you have completely buy into their terrible style_management style_management and decide to take on that approach ) , they might create a role just for you and never actually hold interview or make public that a new role have be create .
the favoritism be out of control .
they have also invent new role , basically get person to do the management dirty work_managements , and ask specialists_application specialist and analyst to take it on .
again , no change_title change_title and no raise .
just way more work and responsibility .
skill and experience be not reward here .
ever .
when other person respond negatively to this new role , management repeatedly claim it be what we have ask for in a survey give out .
in reality , we have ask that our manager be more available .
they basically do the opposite by put more person between we and they .
<B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> blame productivity on the person leave in a department that be clearly understaffed and often employ gaslighting to get their employee to comply .
if you mess up and have a understaffed department do make your employee feel like they be to blame for not do enough .
they be always work hard .
how about thank they in a genuine way ?
maybe even apologize when management mess up ?
do you really want to be a manager use
a tactic for psychological abuse on your employee ?
probably not .
<B-ORG> <E-ORG> ( or lack thereof ) :
when start , there be a attitude_sink or swim attitude_sink .
if you do pick it up on your own and exceed without any help , then you fail .
there be hardly any resource for anyone who be fail besides be reprimand .
their attempt at improve morale be embarrassing and as soon as they see any major issue go away they return to their same way , which have prove time and again to be very very bad .
they operate on a ' put out mentality_fires' mentality_putting .
there be no forward thinking , no planning ahead .
management have make it seem like they do have time for meeting .
and then they get mad when their employee do go to they with concern or struggle .
if you make yourself unapproachable and continually have a bad attitude , you can expect person to go out of their way to seek guidance from you .
management love to ask rhetorical question in meeting .
it be a way to belittle staff .
the relationship between manager / employee be not professional .
shift : management do not make it enough of a priority to inform applicant of the possible shift they will work .
instead , they make vague statement when ask if we will week_work a typical week_work week_work .
honesty be really their thing .
instead , they lie and then treat their employee like child who be listen when they explain how it all work .
if you end up with a '' shift_swing shift_swing '' you be treat as though that assignment be a deserve punishment that you need to earn your way from in order to get a shift_day shift_swing .
person who start at the same time as you will have your desire shift from the start , not have earn it in any capacity .
sexism :
it be difficult to imagine my career grow within the department_support department_support because management be almost entirely make up of man .
any effort make to provide opportunity for socializing and bonding within the department be base around dominated_male - dominate interest and activity such as shooting and sports_fantasy sport league .
there be no effort to come up with activity that would be inclusive of all interest or at least have a variety of activity cover many interest .
outside of support , man in high up position continuously creep on young woman .
the environment of the company allow they to keep do it .
advice :
if you want to know how to improve our department , ask your employee , and here be the key , do shoot they down .
they be the expert of their day to day .
they know it well than you so maybe give they some more credit and hear they out .
management can listen to feedback because they be always on the defense .
stop allow news to travel through the grapevine .
it be unprofessional .
take some courses_management course - you do know what you be do at all and the <S-ORDINAL> step be acknowledge the need for professional opportunities_development opportunity for courses_management to improve .

most importantly , unlike other large corporation , <S-ORG> do have the mindset of squeezeze out every drop from you while constantly threaten layoff .
con : some manager and employee be very cliquey
<B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> effort_% expect all the time
they review on a curve , so someone always have to come out unsatisfactory advice :
if person be good at their job and do want to advance , let they do their job !
create paths_advancement path for person who be good at what they do , but do want to manage or lead .
work - life_Work balance_life could be good .
not everyone want work to be their whole life .

<B-ORG> <E-ORG> do not have that much span in the late iteration and <B-ORG> <E-ORG> marketing_Unit team be duplicate effort .
advice : none pro : <S-ORG> have manage to stay ahead of the curve and grow despite it size , new and entrench competitor , and the movement of it products_core product to <S-ORG> .
the company be well run and there be very few company on the planet that can sell <B-ORG> <E-ORG> like <S-ORG> do .

con :
a manager_fare manager_fare will make every work_day work_day enjoyable and increase productivity .
a bad manager will only think about his / her own promotion and not care about team .

and you will be the one to fix it .
get chew out for situation outside of your direct control will be a regular occurence , as with most job .

it be go the route_i2 route_i2 , obsolete and incompetent .
advice : too much nepotism and favoritism at level_leadership / <S-ORG> level_leadership .
this be lead to incompetence in service_customer service_customer and delivery .
listen to your customer face architect .
pro : <S-ORG> use to be great for education but not anymore .
con :
there a fair amount of administrative inertia that happen , ton of rule , and everyone want to have a say in everything ... it sometimes create a drag on progress when there be too many meeting to talk about thing .
advice : none pro :
there a lot of freedom to identify needs_market need , make thing that actually match what person tell you they want .
con : be warned : if you accept a job_day as a application specialist here think it a job_day job_day with normal ( 7 - 9 a.m. start_am and 4 - 6 p.m. end ) , you might end be mistaken .
management hire separately for the shift_night shift_night on support , but do not hire separately for <S-ORDINAL> ( shift_swing ) shift_night .
so , upon be hire as a application specialist , there be a chance you will be put on a unusual shift require work until <B-TIME> <I-TIME> <E-TIME> and / or on weekend -- for a undetermined amount of time , often a year or more .
work on a shift_swing shift_swing do not come with a increase_pay increase_pay , though obviously it come with a lot of add stress both personally and professionally .
management overall be poor in the <S-ORG> department_Support .
within the department , it can be very confusing and frustrating to understand how to " move up . "
management be very cagey and stubborn about increases_title or pay increase .
while there be a official set of expectation in term of how to be promote within the department , management tend to delay or insist you " be quite there yet . "
employee accept hard , more complicated work without title or increases_pay increase in the hope ( and sometimes , with assurance from management ) that the title or increases_pay increase will come in the future .
some end up work <S-DATE> or <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> without see the promotion .
support department_Support management_department often have a hostile attitude towards employee that can create a toxic , tense , and needlessly stressful environment_work environment_work .
some fellow coworker of mine have describe it as be similar to a " high environment_school " environment_school in which employee be treat like misbehave child .
almost everyone work incredibly hard , but the department seem to be perpetually understaffed , and this gap between work to be do and number of worker be not treat empathetically by management but rather as a fault of the worker .
it often feel like the department_support department_Support be stick in a state_limbo state_limbo between be a center_call center_call ( think <S-ORG> ) or a more typical department_support / department_application department_consulting department_Support in a company_tech company_tech .
this can end up be quite frustrating as a employee -- especially in the early stage of work on cases_support , your job be very number - drive , and you will be strongly expect to handle a certain number of cases_support case per hour .
simultaneously , there be a strong expectation for support employee to become more like " consultant " in term of have in - knowledge_depth knowledge_depth of highly technical concept and process .
as you might imagine , it be stressful to feel stretch by <S-CARDINAL> seemingly opposing side : I need to close x case <S-DATE> but I also need to handle this very complicated and technical case that would truly require <S-TIME> of research to grasp .
other part of the company often feel at odd with support rather than on the same team , add to the sense of pressure to do thing both quickly and perfectly .
advice : <S-CARDINAL> . attitude and communication .
I think a major shift_attitude shift_attitude and revamp_communication revamp_communication be need .
the attitude with which management approach work with their employee be not ground in mutual respect , growth , and positivity .
too often " that just the job " be use as a excuse to avoid real growth or change departmentally .
yes , work support anywhere be a tough job , but the morale and environment_working environment_working of support at <S-GPE> be unusually bad compare to similar company .
<S-CARDINAL> treat employee with great empathy and understanding .
<S-CARDINAL> hire separately for non-standard shift .
you currently have separate postings_job posting use for shift_night shift_night vs. day shift_night .
candidate should know roughly what the working hour be of the job_office they apply to in a job_office job_office .
again , why be there a separate posting_job posting_job for <S-TIME> support_shift support_night and not for <S-ORDINAL> / support_swing support_shift support_night ?
include more woman in management .
woman be fairly well - represent in other department_Support in <S-GPE> , but the <S-ORG> department_Support often feel dominate by man , both in official roles_management role and in unofficial internal role .
<S-CARDINAL> create transparent standard for the different position / title within support and hold yourselves accountable to that standard .
in other company , move from " <S-ORDINAL> support_level " user_end user_end support_level to " <S-ORDINAL> support_level " user_power user_end ( <S-ORG> in <S-ORG> term ) be a promotion that come with a increase_pay increase_pay and change_title change_title .
the work be significantly different , more complicated , and require more skills_consultant skill .
there should be clearly document and , more importantly , followed plan for this promotion , and it should be drive by growth_employee growth_employee and aptitude rather than needs_staffing need .
<S-CARDINAL> accept mistake as opportunities_learning opportunity .
whether intentionally or not , you have instil a culture where many employee be absolutely terrified of make mistake .
your employee be human being , many of they in their <S-ORDINAL> job out of college , and shou
ld be treat with empathy .

support be leave to basically just do whatever the customer be demand , not ask , but demand .
there be no real scope of what should be support , it be just a free for all .
a customer do like the font the application be write in , well then it be clearly a product of the issue and need to be fix ASAP .
the volume of work have increase tenfold within <B-DATE> <E-DATE> but the staffing have either stay the same or decrease due to person leave due to burnout .

no metric to analyze performance in order to succeed , you just suppose to know what a good job be and be not
almost <S-DATE> or <S-DATE> restructuring_quarterly / reorganization of duty
lack of headcount in Engineering or support team
too many person with " authority_management " authority_management to dictate <S-ORG> priority who be outside of the <S-ORG> department_Workers
zero support_Zero from management on how the platform work per design , may time you be tell to just make it work regardless if it be possible or not ... management need to stand with their worker and not sabotage they advice :
this company need to hire more <B-ORG> <I-ORG> <E-ORG> staff_Engineering in order to deliver on the over bloated and semi-impossible promise its states_management state .
during my time here each year the quality become bad and bad , and yet we hire more and more " manager " to micromanage a ever shrink / rotate team of support &amp_Support ; Engineering .
worker morale_Worker be a medium at well due to the stress place on that to deliver result .
management be out of tune with its worker and show no sign of connect , respect , or value its person who do the actual work .
there be also a dangerous deficit of accountability as thing involve multiple team .
the term " that be not my job " be use with well means as more ask of person outside of their authority be make .
when it come time to audit , that who inform the worker to " just do the work " be silent and offer no defense to the worker who be tie to the work via logs_history log .
despite this , overall it be not bad , just what department you end up in .
however the problem at <S-ORG> ( <S-ORG> ) be grow as management have <S-CARDINAL> respect for its worker and their need for a decent &amp_work &amp_work ; balance_life balance_life .
I would place morale_worker morale_worker , and I mean that who do the real work , not the countless manager ... morale_worker morale_worker I would say be <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> at good and <B-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <I-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> <B-DATE> <E-DATE> .

he have already talk to everyone else on the team . )
complain to <S-ORG> do no good .
we too small of a office for they to care what go on here .
so you just have to suck it up and deal with it until you find a good job .
if you a engineer_software engineer_software , there be no opportunities_career opportunity due to the clog at the top with the senior manager .

nothing get do at Concur unless you know someone .
file a ticket because you need a static ip address_IP at your desk , so you can do test ?
it will be deny , it will simply languish for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> , until you contact this guy you know who tell you who would know who to talk to , and <B-TIME> <E-TIME> late you track down someone to
take care of your problem , and <B-TIME> <E-TIME> after that it do .
woe betide the remote employee who do start out with a automatic network_support network_support of the person in the office near he .
HR / benefit be never your friend .
example : you read the rule of how the matching_401k matching_401k work ( update for <B-DATE> <E-DATE> ! ) on the company benefit site_web site_benefits , and schedule your matching_401k contribution accordingly .
except the match do come in properly .
so you file a ticket_HR ticket_HR , which get ignore .
so you go and find the appropriate person via networking ( see above ) and say ' look this be work how your document say it should ' .
and they say ' wait where do you get that document ' and you say '... the benefit site_web site_benefits ? '
and <B-TIME> <E-TIME> late they write you a email say ' thank you for point out that document , it be wrong and we have remove it and the right document be elsewhere and it say that you go to lose out on <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> <B-DATE> <E-DATE> and that be not our problem . '
and if you want your money , that you be entitle to accord to their own document , you will have to sue they , because not give you the money you be entitle to be a hill that they will die on .
HR / benefit make a lot of mistake .
for example , issue incorrect w2s , and then have to correct they , and issue incorrect correction , and have to correct those .
and then <B-DATE> <E-DATE> issue incorrect w2s again .
like ' accidentally ' take double the legal amount for hsa out of your paycheck , and then tell you that they could correct it themselves , and that you would have to do so ( even though the <S-ORG> contractor_HSA they use say that it their responsibility to correct it ) .
and then in order to correct it make you sign a document that say ' the undersigned have be advise to discuss this with a <S-ORG> or a law_tax law_tax expert_law ' and then refuse to pay for you to discuss this with a <S-ORG> or a law_tax law_tax expert_law .
even though they be the one who create the problem in the <S-ORDINAL> place .

con :
not busy = mean that it be really quite boring , and not just for my position either the sale team_sales be equally as bored .
where to start ?
• poor training , have no idea what be go on for the majority of my employment and therefore I do learn anything to help I develop any skill .
•lack of communication between all the department , lead to a lot of confusion
• manager be way too passive aggressive
• the <S-ORG> team_Sales be quite good at return call , however some member of the team_service team_Sales just do care ( I do blame they ) but the consequence be that customer get angry at receptionist_le receptionist_le .
( which reminder , be train for )
• diversity be probably good , the other employee have low key racist comment or discriminatory comment to certain race etc. .
additional meh thing :
• the layout of the place make it very hard to see thing and do my job
•update areas_employee area please , the toilet be horrible , the kitchen be just grim and have very basic thing , just a kettle actually
• you would think for a <B-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <I-MONEY> <E-MONEY> company they would provide more for the staff like lunch , good utility , even caring and that free
• sick be pay which be just stupid
probably a lot more , but my experience be mine alone .
I would recommend work here in the dealership as they be quite boring , high pressure , confuse
would management_d and bad balance_work / balance_life balance_work .
advice : be good .
pro : not a busy environment which be both a pro and con *

con : <S-CARDINAL> - incompetent skills_management : the skills_management skill of middle and top skills_management be very poor .
<S-ORDINAL> the manager do not understand how the industry_software industry_software work and then do not have the inclination of learn how it work .
the person skills_management skill of most of this manager can be gaug from the fact that a <S-CARDINAL> team_member team_member have see <S-CARDINAL> person leave ( in <B-DATE> <E-DATE> time_years ) because they could work in the <S-ORG> be environment_VW .
2- management focus_Management :
the top manager hardly play any role in the success of the projects_IT project .
top / middle manager_project or manager_project manager_project hardly come into picture .
<S-CARDINAL> senior manager seem to have just <S-CARDINAL> point_role - point_role out to person that " this door can be use for exit " , " you need to wear tie " " you be only work the normal working hour ? ? "
<S-CARDINAL> - life_work - life_work balance_life :
it be a very clear message from manager that developer need to work more that the normal working hour ( no , budget do permit overtime ) .
their estimate be generally very very poor and person end up work on weekend .
to give you a idea of the estimate :
for <S-CARDINAL> project the lead_development lead_development estimate <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> of effort_development however the total lead_development effort_development be <S-CARDINAL> + days_man day .. that too when developer have to cut corner to get the minimum functionality deliver .
I do think there be even a proper discussion on why the estimate be so wrong .
<S-CARDINAL> - development_software development_software process :
Agile ?
-no
waterfall ?- no
adhoc ? - yes
weird ?
- yes
depend on the whim and fancy of manager ?
- no ( remember that manager do not come into picture at all )
depend on the whim and fancy of lead ?
- yes and no ( yes , the process_development process_development keep change on the whim and fancy of the lead , however as the lead have no developers_control - developer can divert the process_development at will )
do the process work ?
- good question !!
<S-CARDINAL> - more focus on service_lip service_lip than performance :
this organisation do value performance .
to be really value , one need to be close to either the lead or the manager and if so , then he can get away with murder .
6- highly political environment : <B-PERCENT> <E-PERCENT> of employee in this department be contractor , include manager_lead and project manager_lead .
<S-ORDINAL> focus of this person be to cover their £_^** £_^** <S-PERCENT> and think about the task in hand late .
it be a highly political environment .
good person keep leave as they can survive and the crappy keep accumulate .
7- not learn from mistake :
the bad part be that the <S-ORG> be department_VW be not learn from its mistake .
I could see the same mistake be repeat over and over again .
advice : create a meritocracy
value competence_Value and performance
learn from your mistake
get rid of the exist managers_crap manager
manager need to play a part to see success in projects_IT project .
concentrate on Pros_process pro : brand name_Brand be the attractive feature

con : the mangement have no vision at all .
promotion be more base on talk_coffee talk_coffee than performance and knowledge .

very poorly run , extremely unorganised , to few staff to do the job properly , shocking management as all they want to do be '' hit with a stick '' to get result and tick the <S-ORG> box , bullying of some weak staff be common place hence the revolve door , sell car seem to be a after Advice_thought advice : look after your staff properly and they will look after you and your company and make it a good place to work thus create continuity with staff not want to leave all the time pro :
the potential_earning potential_earning be quite good with a great brand_quality <S-ORG> brand_quality
con : <S-ORG> be a place where they try to create rule to make work efficient and fair for everyone , but the truth be this rule be only apply to certain person .
for example , there be a rule that <S-CARDINAL> person with the same education and experience_work experience_work should not be pay differently .
there be another rule that set levels_payment level ( groups_tariff group ) for person base on experience and education .
there be a <S-ORDINAL> " rule " not write anywhere but enforce by HR when they find convenient that say person can be promote <B-CARDINAL> <I-CARDINAL> <E-CARDINAL> tariff up .
sound all fair , but now , if you tell HR that you be get a salary of x which happen to be way low than you would get at <S-ORG> with the same experience and education .
they will offer you less than they should , you accept , fair enough , not their fault you do know well .
you get hire , you be already make less money than person with the same education and experience and thus there be a rule be break .
then you ask for a raise to put yourself on the same level of your colleague , they say no because you can be " promote " many tariff like that .
but it be not a promotion as accord to the group_tariff group_tariff that be exactly what you should be pay in the <S-ORDINAL> place .
would be great if would stop there .
let say you have a friend in high place at <S-ORG> and you do have the education nor the experience to ask for a high salary .
still , you ask for a category ( salary ) that be mean for someone with <B-DATE> <I-DATE> <I-DATE> <E-DATE> more experience
than you have .
in general , <S-ORG> would say no to this kind of request but as you come from internal and very important recommendation you get the salary that be not mean for you .
now you be break <S-CARDINAL> rule , where you make more money than person more experience and have a category not mean for you , just because of nepotism .
to make thing even bad , <S-ORG> pay way less to woman than man .
advice : manageman at <S-ORG> be the reason why the company be such much behind innovation .
