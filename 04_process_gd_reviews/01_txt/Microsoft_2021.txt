Cons: Many old timers in top level management who talk about D&amp;I but do not follow it. Retaliated and bullied by manager for raising a D&amp;I issue despite strong evidence. HR didnâ€™t act to rectify either. D&amp;I is just in the books but not in practice at all: Some internal processes are extremely slow. Promotions are highly subjective and seem based on tenure instead of performance. Got top performer of the year last year and after raising a D&amp;I issue within 3 months , moved to bottom most performer despite all kudos and appreciation from 360 peer feedback. Ratings are at the mercy of the manager!
Advice: Standup for what is right and do not support old timers just because of their tenure in the company . Makes the work place very toxic. Make performance ratings mix of a manger feedback and 360 peer feedback. Take away undue bullying power from 1st line management and do weighted average score from 360 feedback for performance.
Pros: Great company benefits. You can see some great people managers and leaders but also not so capable and very egoistic/arrogant who are still with the company due to their tenure. Leads to a toxic web of management circle sometimes due to their relationship with each other over years. Makes any good thing hard to surface after layers of politics.

Cons: Sometimes callers aren't initially the most friendly at the start of the call, but if you're great with de-escalation, working with harried folks, and good at providing swift support solutions, by the end of the call you will happily turn it around and often end up with a new friend
