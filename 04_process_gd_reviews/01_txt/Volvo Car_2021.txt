Cons: Volvo Cars: If you are not prepared to network and actively think about your career path, you might get lost in the jungle.

Global Graduate: If you're not interested in cars, there will be a lot of mandatory education that you perhaps might find not very giving.
Advice: Graduate Program: Give the option for new graduates to indiciate whether or not they prefer pure software based knowledge, as opposed to technical car knowledge, and then tailor the mandatory education offered in the program accordingly. For example, a cloud developer does not need to know anything about car aerodynamics.
Pros: Pros with Volvo Cars as a company: it is a big company in Swedish standards, and is undergoing rapid transformation. Some areas are new with lots of problems and uncertainty, some are old and outdated, and some are somewhere in between. So, the area and its stage of maturity is also important to consider when applying for a job at Volvo Cars.

Pros with Global Graduate as a role: It is one of the best entry trajectories to the company imaginable. Try whatever you want and where you end up after the program rests on you.

Cons: It's been a good number of years since Volvo Cars started its agile transformation.

Until now, the company has little trust in the reliability of the individuals filling agile roles (RTE, PM, SM, PO).

The line management is a complete pain in the head.

If you go around in the corridors of Volvo Cars, and pick any random PO/SM and ask them their take on the line management, they would tell you "I hate them, they are horrible".

In the new organization structure at Volvo Cars, the number of layers of line management was reduced. It's high time to terminate the line management organization in its entirety and transfer its responsibilities (and they're trifling for what matters) to the agile roles in the organization.

The current line management may assume agile roles. If they don't want it, they have the door, they can go back to the Ericsson they have already ruined!
Advice: None
Pros: Nothing that stays in the mind to be honest.

Cons: Low salary. 
Slow career progression. 
Salary progression stagnates where new grads catch up to your compensation.
Other companies in EU will generally compensate much more ( more than a 100% from experience ).
Advice: Management is generally good, but to retain talent it's important to consider career development and salary progression of employees.
Stepping into a management role or frequently switching roles shouldn't be the only option for progression.
Pros: Fantastic colleagues. 
Generally flat hierarchy. 
Fun work environment. 
Independence. 
Work life balance.

Cons: - Lack of clarity on career growth.
- Lack of right talent and competence to build better digital products.
- Messy organisation, which leads to loads of meetings just to get something done.
- Competence varies from team to team.
- Software competence is atrocious.
- Executives have been there for more than 15 to 20 years. Says a lot about what is hindering growth in the company.
- Employees at Stockholm office are NEGLECTED on all levels. [From benefits to office space / location]
- Not diverse at all. [Just go take a look at the executive team.
- New blood held back due to bureaucracy.

Design reorg a year ago doesn't address the root of the problem. Lots of churn in the company, especially in the stockholm office, resulting in the need to ramp up hiring in other Swedish cities or lure people to move.
Advice: Buckle up for a rough ride. We are too slow. Empower the new hires to build great digital products rather than hinder them with the old, otherwise you risk losing more talent.

Start to think and act more like a global company instead of thinking within your own confines of Torslanda. 

Promote more women and POCs. Have a clearer plan for ICs to progress their career.
Pros: - Amazing colleagues.
- Good benefits for being a Swedish company.
- Beautiful cars / products.
- Great brand values.
- Safety is key. [But other competitors are on par or catching up]
- Great revival from the after being bought by Geely.

Advice: None
Pros: Great people culture, premium products and environmental awareness.

Cons: To work as a carpainter can sometimes be tough for your body.
Advice: None
Pros: If you like to work with cars this is a great place for you. Especially if you love Volvo.

Cons: Too many meeting back to back.
Advice: None
Pros: The benefit in this company is quite good. Like annual leave, medical cover all dependent. They have increment every Year.

Cons: Could be better if work from was available all the time
Advice: work life balance better could a area of improvement

Advice: None
Pros: The level of respect for the workers

Cons: - Needs to have more focus on software development principles.
Advice: None
Pros: - Work-life balance
- Good friendly relationship

Cons: Some managers are less good
Advice: None
Pros: Talented cooworkers
Good atmosphere
Good opportunities within the company

Cons: Stressfull, overtime every week, criminal people in the management and lots of substance abuse. Horrible culture and place to be.
Advice: Clean up in the organization and make it legit.
Pros: Good salary but that probably the only thing worth mentioning about this company

Cons: Old school leadership way too common, generally poor senior management behaviors and narcissist CEO not fitting a transformation to tech. Confuses culture for campus feel and ping pong tables.  Needs to hire people for virtual teams to meet skills gap but focus on office presence simultaneously. Younger and lower level leadership much more promising but need to act like bumpers currently. Deep but not broad specialists - sub optimization of almost everything main rule.
Advice: Address your own and others behaviors, stop trying to control yourself to success. Embrace the needed software culture, dare to let go of control and act like know-it-all’s  and stop behaving like power hungry VPs from the 90s. Embarrassing.
Pros: Good intent culture. People approachable and kind. Wants to modernize and transform itself and succeeds in parts. Decent pay since HR stopped interfering. Actually do have a unique position as a (comparatively) fast mover into mobility in premium segment. Strong brand.

Cons: Compensation for software developers is way less than in any German OEM, even not talking about Tesla or any other US-based company. Benefits program is also incredibly poor: it is super cool to buy a new Volvo with a 15% discount but it is still not affordable for a person who is working as a software developer without a loan for 5-7 years.
Advice: If you would like to be like Tesla for a software engineer, you must be as attractive as Tesla. Otherwise really good engineers will never prioritize Volvo's offer over Tesla's offer. Right now Tesla is a way ahead of you.
Meanwhile, for manufacturer workers the situation is completely opposite, it think you're better than Tesla.
Pros: Company is investing a lot of money in an attempt to beat Tesla. Volvo Cars is really trying to change from being a pure vehicle manufacturer to the software oriented OEM brand.

Cons: Because of the set up of the program, you rotate to a new role every 4-6 months and therefore you feel as the ‘new person’ a lot. It’s not really a con, just something that might be challenging for some.
Advice: None
Pros: The graduate program is a great way to learn about different parts of the company, to become really confident in the business as well as comfortable with uncertainty.

Cons: As a technician you have to pre call customers, diagnose the car (obviously), price up the parts, check the stock, call customer to get authority, order parts then carry out repair. Feels like you have to do everyone's job. 
Lots of waiting appointments which aren't properly organised.
Advice: None
Pros: Nice people to work with
Great product
Lots of training courses to progress

Cons: Nothing that I can think of.
Advice: None
Pros: Volvo Cars has a good company culture which makes you enjoy working in the company.
It feels good to be part of a company with nice products which brings customer safety on top of all the decisions. as a SW Engineer, working Agile is also a highlight of working in an automotive company.

Cons: They are so good at talking, but you will get nothing at the end
Management avoid writing, they do things in a meeting, so you can never has anything to prove!
Management gets it all wrong and it is so easy for them to get on with it, as they get promoted, and someone else to clean their mess.
Advice: You need 21st century mentality and way of working, get down from your ivory tower.
Pros: Nothing really, unless you like developing a product while talking by the coffee machine!

Most office spaces are very good, but in some buildings still lacking a bit

Pros: Scandinavian culture is very awesome to work.
