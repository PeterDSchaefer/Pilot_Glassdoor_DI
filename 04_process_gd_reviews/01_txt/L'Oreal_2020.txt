Cons: If you want to learn the art of politics this is the place.
It’s full of people with big egos especially management at the top. If you’re not French or French speaking/understanding at least, your chances of climbing up is pretty much zero.
During meetings French management Are incredibly rude. We had a big meeting once and junior staff were explaining things and the bosses suddenly talked to each other in french and then laughed and said we made a decision and it’s bla bla. I mean how rude and condisending?

Who you know in the company and if you’re likeable also matters hugely. When you start out in the company your pretty much are expected to schmooze and build fake relationships. If you’re good enough at playing the game, you’ll go up.

Decisions can change in an instant and all your hard work is wasted without an explanation.

They also force you to come back to office even during the COVID outbreak saying it’s the culture of L’Oréal and you can build connections better bla bla. But the reality was that work was going on perfectly fine and things were getting done.
HR is pretty useless in this company and I feel a lack of humanity and empathy.

You’ll also encounter many incompetent individuals at the managerial roles and despite all the negative comments to HR, nothing changes.
Advice: None
Pros: -You’ll learn to be independent and push for something you believe in
-Staff sales and/or free beauty products

Cons: While you know you have Job security, if you're black that's all you have.
I work in their retail sector at one of the malls in South Africa, growth is limited, there are extreme limitations for a black/African to get a promotion if one has aspirations to work at the head offices. In the years I've spent working for them, I have observed that non-black individuals such as Indians and Whites no matter how less qualified they may be get opportunities compared to blacks, Black people are usually kept in the same position for years with no growth, like every other corporate you have to train the unqualified seniors that join the team. During this pandemic policies that apply to staff at HQ do not seem to apply at the retail level, HR is run by managers. safety precautions such as masks are not provided while HQ staff work from home and the go to the extent of pregnant retail staff keep going to work in high-risk zones. They would rather delegate responsibilities of a role that needs to be filled to existing staff than to hire or promote someone. Working hours are sometimes unrealistic especially in a pandemic when they don't consider the curfew. The management style is "Fear and intimidation" and they can go to the extent of making working conditions so difficult that they eventually resign. It's extremely toxic

As you read this you might think this is another rant about race but this is the truth. When you ignore all the other factors stated, I enjoy my job but the moment Interact with HQ management it takes the fun and drains everyone in the team.
Advice: Be fair, change your management style
Pros: Flexible but that's all I can that's I can think off

Cons: It's just a pity you can't rate zero stars...

They develop L'Oreal interns and grads that ultimately move up very quickly resulting in people in high profile roles that don't have any experience of working elsewhere, and know no better than the norm which is an awful, toxic culture and rubbish short term turnover strategy. 

Development within the company is based on who you know and networking, and not at all on your skills or accomplishments. 

Hours are 9-5 but comments will be made multiple times if you don't work above these, it's all about working hard at L'Oreall, and not smart. People stay until 8pm watching Match of the Day on their screens to be seen to be staying late, and being promoted as a result. Who has time to compete with that? It's 2020 God damn.

"Feedback" is massively encouraged through trainings but I've never met a worse bunch in giving it, and receiving it. HR are absolutely nowhere to be seen, apart from with management, which is a red flag in itself.
Advice: Focus on sell out strategies and rework targets to drive this, which will ultimately drive the sell in; short term pain for long term gain etc.

Last but not least, stop plugging important issues like work life balance, ethics etc until the company makes a change, it is massively disingenuous and a lot has to change before celebrating /plugging these issues is remotely acceptable.
Pros: Free products, occasional charity and staff sales. Nice canteen and the company that run it make an exceptional effort to provide variety which doesnt go unnoticed.

Cons: The culture is really bad. People scream and curse to each other on meetings and one have no autonomy, even in higher roles such as directors, as you need to do as you're told so. People work from 8h to 23h and that seems normal and expected. If you are a fresh undergrad and really competitive, it can be a great fit. However, if you have family, especially kids, it can be really tough. I suffered psychological harassment from direct management and when searched for help, HR said this person had already made it several times before, but when confronted last time, she said she was going to change. HR confessed having no authority to do anything. So I left and even so, had to hear that "I was going to lose the job of my dreams and I would regret for the rest of my life, and they wouldn't accept me back when I come running asking for my job again". I didn't.
Advice: None
Pros: Besides the great brands and lovely products, the people there is trying their best to thrive on a fast paced company with no guidelines, no clear processes and mostly top-down policy. There is a lot of benefits, such as extra paid time off, free courses and free products (although in my country there's no way to buy what you want with discount. Forget about it!).

Cons: - VERY organic, no structure whatsoever they like to call it "Organizational Chaos" and pretty proud of it. This company is for you if you are resilient, and can adapt to changes. This might be too much after a couple of years. 
- Highly competitive and it's hard to find work/life balance.
- Toxic work culture. Work culture is oriented to confrontation. If you don't like to be challenged and like to defend your ideas it might not be the place for you (I did like that)
- Nobody will tell you what and how to do something. You need to be highly proactive and get your way through people
- Above pay rate of the rest of multinationals. Other companies pay better.
Advice: The company has more than 100 years, and it needs structure in order to people not to be burnout. The amount of workload and the little pay makes your employees leads to a 100% assurance of a burnout.
Pros: - Work with amazing and iconic brands. If you are into cosmetics, you might enjoy it a lot. 
- Great company to learn about marketing. I can say this is the best company if you want to work and learn in Marketing. However, it's a really hands-on job. Very holistic job
- Easy to grow within the company (as long as you show results)
- A young organization, therefore I found long-lasting friendships

Cons: Not so great on mapping processes, handovers, and hiring the best person for the job. Manager's skills vary a lot, so depending on which team you are at it can be great or not so much. They still don't have 360 reviews, which could help the company to find out how their managers perform. Be prepared for a lot of overtime, rather a hectic day time and never-ending changes. The HR team is not what can be expected from the company at that level. Quite a lot of people getting stressed out and sick.
Advice: Managed by example, be aware of stress levels at your teams and do something about it instead of talking about it. Less talking more action. Implement 360 to see how your managers are performing.
Pros: Great international and friendly environment. The best company if you like working in teams and have lots of professional colleagues. Work equipment and workplace top of the range. Very modern and new tech from building to equipment to leading style. Plenty of place for carrier and personal development which is a steep learning curve. It is a fast-changing company which is both good and bad.

Cons: - Middle management is a bit weak, most people seem to be promoted based on duration in the company
- Lack of empathy from management and HR 
- Salary in operations is not on par with other FMCG companies
- Long hours and weak IT systems. A lot of administrative work that may not exist in other companies due to the weak systems
- High turnover rates, which leads to the same problems and issues arising every year. Job gets repetitive after a while
Advice: Need to listen more to people on the ground and not disregard their advise and opinions.
Pros: - Employees generally treat each other with respect. You will make lifelong friends here. Culture is quite fun if you can fit in
- Opportunity to work overseas through expatriate/ mobility programs
- Development opportunities, although you need to perform well in your role to access these opportunities. If you are average/ below average, opportunities are limited
- Company is committed to ethics and sustainability
- Fringe benefits like free products and staff price

Cons: You will only get commission if you hit the sales target per month. If you don't, the basic pay is akin to getting paid peanuts. And the sales target only rises every month. 
Have to travel everywhere depending on which location you get dropped to.
Peer pressure. 
Not for anybody who's in for fast cash. You need passion, guts and a face made of steel for this job. It gets rewarding in the long run as you get more experienced.
Advice: Change your part time clock in system from a written one to a fully digitalised one. I hope you have already. Other than that, solid job.
Pros: Pretty cushy job as you are only required as a part timer to sell and introduce products to prospective clients. 
Supportive HR
Every location has a different type of customer and target audience, so you get to interact with all sorts of people.
Pretty high commission.
You get to use and sample the products.
You get training, and that helps to prepare for your work.

Cons: Many members of management are not great leaders
The vision is not always clear 
Can be slow to implement change on "must-haves" 
Base salaries not competitive and lack transparency to salary scale
HR does not work with you but against you to meet their own objectives and not the company's
Need to do a great deal with small budgets
Advice: Scratch the surface of your leadership team. Too much "smoke and mirrors" and lack of real substance
Provide more growth opportunities to your senior management. 
Align your HR team to company goals and department requirements. Make them listen to what is truly needed. Involve them more in the business to reduce making bad hiring decisions which affect team morale and company revenues.
More transparency from the top
Pros: Very entrepreneurial which allows you to learn a great deal
Lots of freedom to implement initiatives
Great offices and location
Many opportunities to move within the company
Access to great products
Many employee-focused benefits (work from home, discounts, benefits, pension)

Cons: Certain brands can be very hierarchical, lack of work life balance, all bad jobs just get given to 'the intern', not very welcomed into the team. Work isn't appreciated only negative feedback given. Grad scheme is so hard to obtain and for a very specific type of person, making a lot of the successful people the same type. I would have had a much better experience if I was in a different brand and don't blame L’Oreal, but have a negative view on the brand and its General Manager.
Advice: Look into certain brands closer so you can see how the GM's in some brands aren't good leaders and their negative values and outlook feeds down into the company.
Pros: Good staff benefits of staff shop and friends and family sale and get to be a part of exciting opportunities

Cons: Culture managed by fear.  Threatening to fire people constantly...upper management is mostly made up of misogynist men with a few women on complete power trips.   While i worked there, my husband was diagnosed with cancer and no one even ever bothered to ask how i was doing for an entire year.  When I left, they tried to retain me with a counter offer.  My answer was: I don’t know what life holds for me....all I know is that I do want kids, and that my parents will most likely pass in the next few years, things will happen....I dont know what,  I only know one thing for sure, I don’t want to be here when it all happens.  ✌🏻
Advice: Care more about your people and it will come right back at you.
Pros: You can find some of the  most brilliant people here.  You can learn so much from a bunch of extremely smart people

Cons: - The worst leadership team with unclear direction. They are aggressive and far from inspiring. 
- Toxic culture. Hilarious that rather than change the culture they just deny it and cover up the faults with dedicated weeks for D&amp;I, leadership etc. Yet they don't implement these core principles. 
- Motivation is based on fear rather than ambition. You can feel the tension in meetings. 
- Hierarchal and political. Be prepared to play the game. 
- Disrespectful and nasty employees
- Unforgiving and do not allow for mistakes
- Managers are clueless about managing. They need to be trained to support
- Thankless job
- There's always someone looking to throw you under a bus
- Bullying culture
- It's not about quality,  It's about making things look pretty and getting ahead
Advice: None
Pros: Find the amazing people who aren't 'L'Oréal' types. There are few, but hold on to them when you find them! They keep you sane. 

-

Cons: I first want to firmly that everything I say in here it's true. This is my experience working at the Montreal downtown office in 2018-2019:

Everyone has a feeling that something's "not right" with the work environment. The turnover rate is very high to begin with, and people working until 10pm is not unusual.

They talk openly about ethics and diversity but they don't practice what they preach. It's all just for show to attract young talent. They mostly hire straight out of college because they are inexperienced with how toxic work environments are and they usually put up with it.

I was pushed by a senior manager and HR to work the 10-plus-hour days without complaint. I tried to explain many times that it was detrimental to my mental health and my relationship at home but they defended the "L'Oreal culture" and said it had to do with the "competences" they wanted to see if I ever wanted to get a promotion. I remember feeling sad and depressed but they reprimanded me for not being grateful to be working there. As a disciplinary measure they extended my probation period and I wasn't eligible for a salary increase since then.

When a coworker found me crying in the bathroom she said "Don't worry, I have seen so many people crying here at L'oreal". We even have a term for it at the office: "Burnout Leave".

Besides that, I also witnessed strange incidents such as:

-Black female employees are the less likely to have their contracts renewed and many of them are "subcontractors" which means they get paid less than permanents and don't receive any benefits despite working in the same office.

-A female top manager had to take an extended medical leave after a very stressful period at work and when she came back she was already replaced by a male co-worker.

I worked here for two years and never felt it was safe to go to HR or management when I had issues.
Advice: Be more aware about the toxic environment, it encourages situations such as racism and discrimination to go unnoticed!
Pros: Discounted products at the boutique

Cons: unprofessional rsm ,
worked in loreal ppd , this wing is just ok
heavy work , moderate pay , just the brand name , absolutely nothing is interesting here

Training is a joke , if u are a bde ,, The attitude of buddies are intolerable , they think they bring the business ,repeating same bi heart classes again and again,they tend to think they are real professional trainer - 

altogether very boring ,, job becomes irritating because of the reason sales person has to also look the job of buddy barbers,nothing exciting
Advice: remove this r buddy system in ppd, it is a headache and nightmare for every sales guy, buddattitude is  intolerable , good people leaving due to unprofessional managers, 

all best to the brand , what a lovely incredible brand!!!!!
Pros: infratrcuture good
 Hr team is good ,., They are world class no doubt.good, Respected brand.

Cons: Extremely cliquey culture depending which division you work in - much worse in some teams than others. Lots of contractors who have zero protection or benefits even after working for L’Oréal for 5-6 years, due to “lack of headcount” - a very unethical practise in my opinion which affected many people during COVID.
Advice: None
Pros: Great team ethos if you work in the right kind of department. Potential to grow and move into various roles if you have a good manager dedicated to your career progression. L’Oréal run many events throughout the year catering to awareness of different topics, and they are relatively good at taking employee feedback on board.

Cons: Does not always reward merit or loyalty
Weak Talent Management Or career progression processes 
Very very few opportunities to move to roles outside the country below Senior Leadership levels
Not the best pay-master in the industry
Not the best ecosystem to learn commercial processes as not a deep-distributed organization.
No processes to ensure parity or balance between grades basis job profile or experience. Majorly manually driven and Subjective on this front.
Advice: None
Pros: Strong Marketing Ecosystem
Very Strong brands with global pedigree
Smaller organisation and hence tighter knit
Very strong focus on Ethics and Diversity
Not very rigid so easier to implement ideas or take decisions
Very good learning opportunity on top-of-pyramid channels like Modern Trade and Ecommerce

Cons: It was hard work in Big bazaar bcoz of their such rules but i m glad that i have passed those things nd make my self a part of Brand staff I can say proudly that i have been working in loreal since 2 years
Advice: I looking forword to good company where i can learn nd achieve my goals
Pros: You will learn so much, How we should stand how we should talk, how can we understand customer needs nd want, how can easily convert a shopper to consumer

Cons: No career or development plans. You are being pushed to whatever job they can find, as long as it is hassle free for them. Some of my friends got even lower rank jobs (yet with the same salary) because "nothing else was available" at the time. 
Changing divisions is always challenging and almost impossible for people if you come from active cosmetics or worse, the professional products division. Top jobs often end up being given to CPD or Luxe employees. 
People who work their way up the corporate ladder are usually the ones that waited long enough and built the right connections, and avoided all the bullets. Performance reviews are a joke: you can demonstrate consistent performances year on year and still being left aside if you do not have sponsors. Darwinism at its best: if a top guy does not like you and you deliver a poor presentation just once, your career progression will come to a halt. I missed a promotion once for the sole reason that the head of the division "did not like me" although my track record was flawless and my line manager and the team leader both sponsored me. 
Still a lot of toxic managers too, some of them being clearly protected by top management. One HRD told me once that "X can't be removed because he/she is protected by the CEO". 
Most of the people getting promoted fit the same description. I can always tell who gets promoted in any team: the highly extroverted, self confident, risk taker, action oriented type. Don't try to be a strategic thinker in this company, or boast your "soft skills" or your 'inclusive" management style. What they like is the charismatic egocentric superman/woman type who can turnaround any situation on his own. 
They do try to change the corporate culture but the guys fostering it are the same guys who contributed to building what was deemed a toxic workplace 10 years ago.
The annual employee survey is now part of every manager's KPI: however,I have heard stories of teams being pressurized to deliver positive feedbacks in exchange of career advancement although this is hopefully rare. 
Finally, the learning in L'Oreal is not as good as the company claims: most of the training is now done online with random classes that are usually poor in content apart from a few MOOC that they advertise a lot. Personal development programs like coaching are reserved for senior management.
Advice: Build real career plans. Empower HR and stop promoting the same archetype of managers that thrive thanks to their networking abilities and interpersonal skills more than their actual performances.  Remove the passionate and emotional judgements from performance reviews with clear and objective KPI's. Change all the senior staff who built a toxic workplace and now slows down the cultural shift.
Pros: Great brands, lots of smart people, some of them being extremely friendly although they usually do not last long in the organization.

Cons: Not all managers are yet aligned with the new way of leading teams
Obtaining bonuses depends on many criteria and the negotiation is not evident
Advice: Make sure that the group's values and action plans are understood and embodied before being shared by the managers, because not all of them are, unfortunately
Pros: Human enterprise permitting personal and professional expansion
The surpassing of oneself and one's job is encouraged and can lead to many projects
Overall, we can envisage a career in this group from the point of view of job, remuneration, social benefits but also in personal/professional training. 
The links between people are very strong

Cons: The company on the decline financially
Advice: The company cannot go far while making losses. Management needs to make the right decisions especially when it comes to sales and marketing, launches as well as fighting for market share. It also needs some consistency at the helm. 2 years for an MD is very little time. You need a strong local MD who can manage the interference from zone and Paris so that to create time and space for delivering results. Failure to this the company might shut its doors.
Pros: Exposure especially for young employees.

Cons: Little preparation for individual contributors becoming managers, what can impact the team during the years while the manager is building their people management skills. Many decisions, not necessarily big decisions, still need the final work from central headquarters in France, what can sometimes undermine efficiency and autonomy.
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, open-mindedness, innovative. In many ways, L'Oréal is what they call an "organic" company, where you build connections and work flows across departments, what makes work more efficient, reflecting your own way of working, to make things happen. Close interaction with different departments and divisions are also a great opportunity to learn.

Cons: You will not be able to leave and go Back to normal GT, if you are working in PPD devision of Loreal. (Keep that in Mind)
HR is just for names sake.
Every thing is under control of 3-4 senior level people, some times does not feel that its a MNC.
System and Process and not good and not even at Par with Locoal Organisations level.
Advice: Interdivisional Transfers should be done every 3 years.
Data should come to teams, as its usually flowing the wrong way always.
Authenticity of data is also a big concern.
Pros: Good Policies
Foreign Trips
On time salary
Good Growth Opportunity

Cons: While state management is really friendly and easy to approach, I found there was often a huge lack of communication and a lot of disorganization. Some of the managers had almost too much of a laid back attitude and there was sometimes a blurr between social &amp; business relationships. The counters can sometimes go for months without resources such as testers/samples with no explanation and it can be frowned upon for you to follow up yourself. If you have a permanent position higher management will generally look out for you a bit more but I found that casuals were often forgotten about/left in the dark about their hours/shifts. There were many times where there were problems with the roster and a few issues with payroll which could be very frustrating. The 'OneLuxe' approach is great in theory and did create a lot of support between the different teams within stores; however, it's way too much work for the state managers to handle on their own and  I think that's where the discrepancies in organisation and lack of communication came from.
Advice: State management shouldn't have to look after more than 2 brands otherwise it gets to be way too much for them and the employees and counters suffer because of it.
Pros: L'Oreal offers an excellent social aspect and a lot of quality training and experience in sales. The job perks are wonderful with free products and the management team is really friendly and easy to approach. If you are working here while studying its an excellent job, however, if you do want to pursue a career in beauty or management there are a lot of opportunities and room for progression. They also work hard to recognise staff achievements and the in-store events can be really fun when they are successful.

Cons: Lack of opportunities to a permanent position in despatch leaving a great number of agency workers who've been working there for years in a situation of precarity with no benefits or career development prospects,
Some managers and supervisors can be quite arrogant, 
Constant performance expectations and reviews with a somewhat innacurate percentage based system resulting in a general sentiment of discontent and lack of morale.
Advice: Creating more opportunities for agency workers to a permanent position.
Pros: Good amount of hours (37.5 weekly),
Decent training provided,
Overall safe and tidy facilities,
Ongoing somewhat secure work.

Cons: Unpaid overtime, no work/life balance, politics, low basic salaries, unrealistic sales targets/ no stock availability to hit targets, no stock handlers available in most stores resulting in back problems from carrying stock from the stockroom to the counter, no support from HR
Advice: Would be great to offer education opportunities to the employees to progress within the company. Salary increase should reflect the work of each employee rather than be based on annual inflation.
Pros: Great trainings, promotions in place if you work for it

Cons: Salary is low compared to the workload, and it almost doesn't change every year regardless of how well you perform. Middle management can be smart individuals, but doesn't mean they are able to lead a team.
Advice: Train excessively newly promoted managers on how to be team leaders and influence.
Pros: You are constantly exposed to so many influential people and organizations, you have the responsibility and oppurtinity to prove yourself and own your brand completely. 
A lot of perks like department and company parties, trainings &amp; employee discounts.

Cons: Il ritmo di lavoro è molto veloce, il che ti aiuta però ad avere un approccio più smart e ti insegna a gestire le situazione in condizioni di elevato stress.
Advice: None
Pros: L'Oréal offre la possibilità di lavorare in modo integrato con le altre funzioni, di diventare esperto del settore e del ruolo ma anche di ampliare di conseguenza le proprie competenze su più fronti. E' un ambiente estremamente sfidante e stimolante che lascia molto spazio all'intraprendenza e offre dei piani di sviluppo ben strutturati per la crescita

Cons: The company's rush and agitated rhythms contribute to create a fast moving work environment which sometimes lead the divisions into un-managed chaos. These moments are also fed by a strong hierarchical structure which slow down the teams short term actions.
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing company to learn thanks to extremely well-prepared and valuable individuals. L'Oréal seeks for excellence in all fields and will push you to perform with high standards in all your projects. This type of working method will let you grow pretty fast in a professional way.

Cons: If you cannot or unclear in work-life balance, you might want to think twice about R&amp;R before on-board.
Advice: Proving a clear expectation for management trainee would help mold a clear direction of learning to their trainee.
Pros: You will meet same minds who strive to win in business and fun in heart. Work hard, play harder. Vast opportunities to explore within firm. A fantastic place where people respect other rights and opinions. Management often gives a good feedback to improve employee, and drive them to seek acheivements.

Cons: Cant get anything done, its a French company so everything is run from France, Department structures are stuck in the past. 
No one says what should be said , only what others want to hear. More time doing work to show the person above you that you have done a good job, than actually doing any work that moves the company forward
Advice: None
Pros: Some nice people , no one really checks what you are doing

Cons: not the right place for you if your are shy and rather an introvert
Advice: None
Pros: - gained valuable insights into the world of trade marketing managers with the possibility to attain networking events, promotional events etc. 
- networking is huge - you'll gain insights into the different departments, different positions etc. 
- you certainly do not feel like an intern if you prove that your capabale of the work you're expected to deliver

Cons: 6 days working for field staff
Weak IT infrastructure 
Growth is slow
Too much hierarchy 
Communication about company plans is passed on to field staff after long delays
Decision making takes time at all levels
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing work culture
Respect for one &amp; all
Tremendous exposure &amp; working in alignment with marketing strategy &amp; sales planning
Concrete and diverse role with team handling experience, dealer management, market working, presentations, analysis, opportunities to share initiatives / suggestions
Supporting managers

Cons: Unless you join as part of the graduate program there are limited opportunities for personal development/progression, particularly if you are a specialist
There are some senior managers who are allowed to steamroller across their direct reports to point just shy of bullying
Advice: Your intentions and aspirations are admirable but actions speak louder than words
Pros: Genuine care for employees
Strive to be an employer of choice
Great benefits
Lack of women in most senior roles

Cons: Please, do not be bamboozled and fooled by the company propaganda plastered all over linkedin and career sites of the fake utopia they want you to believe in. Before accepting this internship at the DMI (Direct Marketing International) in Paris I was warned by professors that they dealt with students being exploited and worked like a slave - I should have listened they were right. If you are reading this I highly advise to work for another company in France. I have 10+ years work experience. I took this internship because I am a foreigner and it was apart of my masters to have an internship and complete it to graduate.   This is by far the worse job I have ever had in my 10 years working as an adult. Interns are exploited at this company. I came to France for better work life balance - haha I should have run away as soon as I got this offer. Plan on leaving the office at 7/8pm - and if you work from home, good luck they will abuse you like an animal. I was told as well as other interns to LIE on our time sheets about the amount of hours we worked because apparently they had a scandal a few years ago about over working interns - I AM HERE TO TELL YOU IT’S STILL HAPPENING and even during a pandemic. Everyone knows we work well past our contract hours - now we are just told to lie about it and WORK IN SECRET. Managers will play a psychological game to save their reputation to HR. They will tell you to go home in person with smiles and concern but in reality you know you cannot because they pushed 5 hours of work on you at 5pm so you end up either staying late at the office or taking your laptop home to finish. My contract said 35 hours, I was easily working 60 - 80 hours a week and sometimes finishing work on the weekend. You try and keep up with the endless demands of managers who will have you redo the same powerpoint 27 times (I am not over exaggerating this is how many times I reworked a powerpoint once that was just used for an internal meeting). The company culture is very hierarchical if you have a lower position you will be ignored or talked down to or most likely not even listened to.   I feel the company is getting away with abusing interns because most of the interns are young and do not have any previous work experience. Also no one reports the bad behavior because they are relying on their manager to recommend them in order to get hired. When I tried to speak up and say something to HR I was ignored and brushed aside and told to speak transparently with my manager who was regularly condescending, her constructive criticism on a powerpoint presentation I completed with another intern was “the beginning is pretty and the end is getting shitter and shitter.” Let’s just say she made the Devil Wears Prada look like a nice person.   Working here is only worth your time if you have an upper management position in this company. Working as an intern you are paid 1200 (1400 but 200 is taken out every month for taxes) and as a junior if you do get hired you will be getting paid 2200 per month and barley scraping by in Paris while you give your entire life to a company that doesn’t appreciate you - I wouldn’t recommend it. Also they will try and entice you to stay for 5 years because at the end of 5 years you have access to shares. All of my managers worked for the company for 5+ years and its the only thing they know in their working careers - I honestly pity them because they do not know that life can be so much better.   I wanted to quit this internship and I couldn’t I had to finish it in order to validate my masters - this is how it is done here in France. The company knows this. They know they own you for 6 months and you won’t be able to get out - my recommendation is don’t start -run away while you still can.
Advice: More accountability needs to be place on managers and how they treat interns. I contacted previous interns that also worked underneath the same female manager and they all had the same experience of bullying as me. 

For a company that plays the moral high ground of social justices, and humanity - basic humanity first starts with how you treat your employees.
Pros: - Discount on the company products
