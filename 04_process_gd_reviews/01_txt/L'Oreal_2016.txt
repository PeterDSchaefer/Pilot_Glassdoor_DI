Cons: The higher up you go, the more politics. Some teams (especially in the headquarters) are not country-centric and too much of the same profile - almost 80% of a function's committee can be all French, who have not been outside of Europe for their careers.  Harder for Asians it seems to have the same career track until a certain point in their career, then it becomes all Europeans in the post. Ethics is a campaign, but I am not sure it is embodied by everyone - especially by some leaders. Average compensation and benefits, nothing exciting.
Advice: Diversity in leadership - please commit to this and not just give the answer "we are still developing leaders in these zones." In bigger countries, the notion of being seen as an individual who can make an impact is lost - I felt this more when I worked in smaller teams.
Pros: Responsibility at a young age, and it's true that there's a lot of possibilities - you just have to remain focused on how you want to grow. Good international career in selected fields (in other functions, there may be lots of competition hence the notion that it's harder to go international). Able to handle projects that have an impact - it's true what they say, it's sometimes all up to you how you want to shape your job role and what kind of projects you want to have as your legacy. Work life balance has improved. Very strong L'Oreal culture passed on from older generations.

Cons: L'Or√©al Denmark is by far the worst employer I  ever faced. I would not recommend this company to anybody.

- Absurdly long working hours. I routinely worked 9-20. On peak times it was even worse (late night & weekend work).

- No recognition for your hard work: managers rotate country/department frequently, and their only concern is to as much performance as possible during their assignment, with complete disregard of employees job satisfaction

- Strong blame culture: managers are put under very high pressure from HQ, and instead of trying to collaborate in order to solve issues, they look for somebody to blame so that they don't get in trouble

- Salary is relatively low, especially in consideration of the high workload

- HR is utterly useless and unprofessional: many co-workers of mine were feeling miserable because of the poor working conditions. HR and Managers provided no support whatsoever, leading them to feel even more hopeless

- Total lack of structure and process thinking: lots of non-value adding and boring tasks that have to be done only to please HQ in Paris

- The high turnover rate is indicative of the level of dissatisfaction that many employees exhibit
Advice: Treat your employees like human beings and not like robots that are sitting there just to produce. Having people who feel valued and considered would benefit the company in the long term.

Working hours are too high. People burn out soon and leave the company, taking away their experience and know-how. I believe it is in the interest of the firm to prevent this.
Pros: Young and international work environment. 
This is primarily due to the fact that locals (danish speakers) can find better jobs in other firms

Cons: - Management and director team who are not open to new ideas
- Very under resourced team
- Long hours... not unusual to do a 60 hour week, and it is somewhat expected to cover the workload
- A high number of interns and graduate scheme individuals - whilst this is great for them to learn working life, the reality is that you have a lot of inexperienced people who are involved in some business critical tasks
- Extremely cut-throat - weekly sales and marketing meetings would tend to have someone leaving at the end in tears (not even joking)
- Rare for all to get their full bonus. Always seemed like an extra hoop to jump through whether you had hit your objectives or not
- Low salary for the location... to have NAMs on circa 40k and SNAMs on 50k does not pay to stay
Advice: Realise that the work hard-play hard expectation does get tiresome after a while. A lot of good, talented people leave within 2 years or so because they've just had enough. Put more staff into your teams and let people enjoy a life outside of work and you will get a lot more from your teams.
Pros: - Vast range of brands
- Product discounts (50% off via the staff shop)
- Young, energetic team
- Relatively central office (Hammersmith)
- Given a lot of responsibility early on

Cons: 1. The internship is real hard work, especially when you're in the sales team. It'll drive you crazy to fulfill the sales target. 
2. You get a lot pressure if you want to be outstanding within the team. So you get emotional every now and then. 
3. They do have great culture, but they're not open for mistakes, you can't have any excuse if you don't get your job done.
Advice: When I was working there, I didn't get any mentor around me, I made mistakes and I fixed them. The HQ didn't really care about each of its employees that much.
Pros: 1. If you're a current college student in China, especially a junior one, it'd be a great opportunity for you to apply for Summer Intern at L'Oreal Group. It challenges you a lot no matter which department you'd work for. And it'll help a lot for the later interview process of their Management Trainee Program. 
2. Great HR team, really professional, they advise you and help you prepare everything. 
3. Once you get involved in their Management Trainee Program, you'll have smooth career advancement if you do work hard. And the working environment is great, you'll see your peers are all professional and outstanding.

Cons: The workload is horrendous. Doing extra hours is an expectation in London but the volume of work meant a poor work-life balance. Don't expect to be promoted to higher management unless you are or at least speak French - of the 6 senior management roles in my division only 1 of them was not French. Management skills need a leave a lot to be desired - the structure is incredibly hierarchical which is not to the best effect. Finally be prepared for politics - it's not always what you know or who you know but how loudly you can shout above the crowd.
Advice: Please think about bringing some additional people into the team to allow room to breathe, think and develop. Reconsider your secondary management. Realise that people should always come first and results will follow naturally.
Pros: There is oodles of opportunity to take on a project and go above and beyond. My peers were lovely across many different functions and there was a general vibe to do well and succeed. It's an ever changing, competitive environment that can really suit some people and the pace is fast - challenging projects can often be expected to be delivered within limited time frames. Also, the products are great with big discounts.

Cons: Hierarchy has no transparency in modus operandi. Totally dishonest and pass on the ball at higher management level. How come Mancomm can be so blind, that they do not realise the ground zero reality. You cannot be a fannatic in approach. HR is only for the name sake as they have no other jobs than to send employee joining details. Because of some higher management people, the entire credentials of the business operation of Loreal is at stake and attrition rate of ground zero guys are substantially high. Even repute in market has gone done and its impossible to recruit talented manpower for 1st and 2nd line ff under Loreal banner.
Advice: Please reveiw it as people leaving the pool have no gain other than helping you to retain the existing talent you have left with. Also down size the bunch of highly paid non deserving Managers to retain the left so called Culture and Values of Loreal.
Pros: I experienced no pros , other than great Brands.

Cons: Human Resource support for expats in Tokyo office lacks professionalism, mainly in salary visibility and administrative support. The tax system is complicated and there is no tax briefing, so you will only know your net income by the end of your expatriation. In my case, a large unanticipated sum (more than 400,000 JPY) was deducted from my final pay. When I requested for clarification, it took them almost a month to reply.
Advice: Improve orientation for new expatriates and standardise the structure for expat packages around the zone. Since the tax system in Japan is more complicated, discuss the packages in NET income instead of GROSS. This will ease the unnecessary stress for expats and give much more visibility where finances are concerned.
Pros: Flexible hours, passionate and fun management, many opportunities for overseas work posting, vibrant and young working atmosphere, great staff discounts. People here are energetic and open to new ideas.

Cons: The IT systems could be better and more cutting edge, but they are working on it and I have seen positive movement to address these issues.
Advice: To continue this great initiative of Beauty for all focusing on sustainable growth both environmentally and socially. Also to continue to inspire a culture of innovation and applauding well calculated risks.
Pros: I have worked for L'Oreal for 7 years and really love it.  I have now lived in 3 countries with L'Oreal and have had an exciting and challenging career path.  I work every day with incredibly intellectually curious people great attitudes that enables us create, innovate and build things every day.  Even though it is a large organization, you still feel the entrepreneurial spirit no matter which function you are in.  The company is also extremely financially stable.

Cons: The company lack of process can drive anyone crazy. Even if you like to work that way. People tend not to give the proper tools to start working. It's like someone give you a Ferrari without you having a driver license. You have to learn how to drive in the middle of a highway. The company it's completely moved by international visits. If L'or√©al CEO or even any Regional Manager comes to your country, get ready for action. Lots of money spent on trying to make a good impression for the top management. The company is completely brand-centric.
Advice: Become more consumer-centric, and less brand-centric. L'or√©al and it's brands shoudn't try to impose consumers what to use or like.
Pros: Really dynamic. Everything can change in a few meetings. The company gives you great independence to propose different strategies and solutions. For those with strong heart and great reselience.

Cons: Not many cons to say, not any cons to say really, I believe if i were forced into saying a con it would be that "I wish they spoke to us more on a personal bases after the brandstorm was concluded, they really do seem like very fun people to talk to".
Advice: None
Pros: Before i talk about the pros and cons its very important to state that I havent worked within the company itself or ever was an integral part of the Loreal community (on a corporate bases), however, I did spend some time working with the representatives of loreal in order to come up with our brandstorm. PROS: Amazing people, they give you a sense of an unbelievably fun and dynamic environment, highly intelligent they really do know what theyre doing. Ended up second Place.

Cons: You need to be on your game all the time, and the pace of action is very fast.
People change jobs very frequently so you're always building new relationships which, whilst stimulating, can slow down progress.
French culture takes time to understand. 
The london office is very tired and needs updating. The executive offices are beautiful, reflecting the brands. Everyone else works in cramped spaces at ugly desks.
Advice: There are too many priorities. Focus more.
Pros: The pay & benefits are slightly above average, not the best, but good. You get rewarded for achievement.
The business is so varied that you can have a whole lifetime career with L'Oreal and never get bored.
It's a fast-moving, entrepreneurial culture with empowerment for anyone who wants to take it.

Cons: You have to work under fast pace environment and sometimes you might be stressed if you could not manage the timeline of your tasks well. Many people are working until very late to catch up with tight deadlines.
Advice: Everyone in the company is super busy especially the management team. You may not be able to get timely feedback and evaluation from the management team.
Pros: L'Or√©al is the world leading skin care & cosmetics company and you will be able to observe the operation of this big multi-national company. You could understand how a beauty brand works under cooperation of marketing & sales team. And more importantly, you could learn time management, multi-tasking and practical analytical skills. Good experience.

Cons: -There is no training at all so most of the times you need to figure out by your own how things are done. This can slow down a lot of processes. 
- Work-life balance culture is a mess. People never leave on time (sometimes they stayed until late night hours).
-Micro-managament gives less room for innovation and (also) slow things down.
Advice: -Empower and trust your employees to innovate more.
-Encourage work-life balance. The key to a successful business is happy employees. 
-Invest on training programs fro all levels and not only senior management.
Pros: -High paced environment where you learn a lot. 
-Opportunity to grow and move within the company. 
-Working in one of the biggest companies worldwide with well known brands.

Cons: Everything changes so fast, including your manager, that will implement on the changing system and policy also. If you can adjust to changes, you definitely can fit. Sometimes the products just don't match with the local need, but you have to sell it anyway.
Advice: Put the best man in your strategic places, not only because they are French.  Local people can be trusted to know their own market, sometimes it difficult to foreigner to understand the local market, especially for DMI who never stay long in that country.
Pros: Great friends and ambience. We had the "work hard and play harder" motto for sure. No boundaries beetween bosses and their subordinate. Encourage to think outside the box.

Cons: - hierarchical organisation, need to use the lines of hierarchy to get things done
- sometimes get a bit lost in details, instead of looking at the bigger picture (but this is inherent to the beauty/fashion business I guess)
Advice: - empower your employees even more to run their projects and fail at some times
- listen more to your employees to stop the high rate of turnover
Pros: - entrepreneurial spirit, room to create things yourself
- innovation at the core, products but also communication model (as of lately)
- young, ambitious colleagues
- lots of responsibilities from the beginning 
- great learning school how to work with people, partners and to get marketing at a very broad level

Cons: - High turnover (never a good sign). 
- On average, 1 person quits every month.
- Business model is based on very young workers (right out of college) taking management positions to keep salaries to a bare minimum, therefore the only real decision makers are the Directors. 
- Most employees earn 60% less than average market salaries in Panama across the board (sales, marketing, etc.).
- Indecisive and bureaucratic upper management.
- Ugly company culture (long hours, horrible bratty bosses, sucking up is rewarded, very political and highly hierarchical)
- Absolutely no work-life balance.
- No real respect for the local culture, since all upper managers are expats.
- Locals are considered the "help" and not really considered for anything other than lower status jobs.
Advice: None.
Pros: - Nice location of main office.
- Good school to learn sales, marketing, supply and then get out within 2 years.

Cons: - Average salaries around 60% vs. other CPG companies.
- It is an 'organic culture'. You need to be comfortable with doing a LOT of work, by yourself, navigate ambiguity and lack of guidance.
- Long and slow growth path to senior management.
- Harsh culture, very independent. Not very collaborative. Senior Management is tough.
Advice: None
Pros: - Biggest beauty company in the world. It is the leading place to start a career in beauty.
- Amazing resources to work with.
- 'Organic' culture. There are not many processes and you have freedom to pursue creative plans, without much burocracy, within certain limits.
- Perks! Tons of beauty products for free or discounted.

Cons: With anything challenging things take time and effort. Expect to work long hours, especially during peak periods. You will be pushed and sometimes stressed but its worth it.
Advice: Modernize outdated and archaic software to more user friendly alternatives. This will improve productivity and help modernize the workforce.
Pros: I've been with L'Oreal for a little over a year now and honestly love working here. My colleagues are smart, competent and hard working. The environment is fast paced and challenging but employees are given every opportunity to  excel and succeed. If you are motivated and ambitious you'll likely really enjoy working here... especially if you have an entrepreneurial spirit.

Cons: Not sure if it is a great place to grow and settle down but if you have an opportunity to work there, don't miss it. The salaries are still below the business benchmark. Home office does not exist in their vocabulary.
Advice: Home office, guys. I think we are the only company of our market which do not do home office. Salaries could be much better, that's why most of the people I know have left.
Pros: It is a great place to learn and develop. It is always changing. There's international mobility. It is a very inclusive company, one of its values is diversity.

Cons: I didn't learn anything valuable outside the company. I was constantly asked to fix small things. Few real responsibilities. They simply hire interns to do jobs that no one wants to do, like write emails and call creative agency to ask them to do small changes to commercials (i.e. make it bold, please more blue...)
As in any marketing department that is not the headquarter, there is no strategic view. It's pure operational marketing: execution of what Paris decides. People are stressed to  execute things that someone else decided and they scream at you too often.
Inefficient processes and old systems.
Advice: Create a Corporate Culture. Innovate processes (you are not really digital if you only use social media). Offer yoga classes to Group product managers
Pros: Exposure to all firm's functions and see complexity of a multinational company.

Cons: Management is hierarchical and old fashioned - a lot of people nearing retirement hold the top jobs and they never, ever leave!  
If you have experience outside L'Oreal forget about it as no one cares.   They will want you to adapt to their way of doing things.
Advice: Listen to teams, manage down and stop sucking up to your boss.  Get rid of Managers who have been promoted to their level of incompetence and give younger managers a chance to do things differently or the company will stagnate and eventually fail.  Accept people who come from outside!
Pros: L'Oreal challenges you and ensures you give your best everyday and as a result you learn quickly to be extremely productive! If you can do it well at L'Oreal you will probably succeed anywhere!

Cons: Quick promotion due to high turnover 
High turnover can lead to very Junior teams and lack of experience 
A lot of time spent retraining and trying to prevent history repeating rather than progressing as a unit 
Pay grades are secretive

Quick promotion if you succeed and overdeliver
Annual conference abroad if good performance 
Discounted products 
Annual profit share for FTEs

Cons: With respect to other global companies, unfortunately there is no work structure at all. You may be responsible for everything or nothing. It is real chaotic environment which may be sometimes very inefficient. Also I should add that no work-life balance, you may receive an e-mail on sunday night and it is totally normal thing for here not an extraordinary campaign period or whatsoever.
Advice: Encourage work-life balance
As i know, according to top management chaotic environment is good for the company' development but it totally blaze high turn over rates and dissat
Pros: Young and dynamic environment is the best side of the Loreal

Advice: None
Pros: Great benefit and accessibility to beauty products, events etc. Additionally, free lunch is provided every Tuesday and Thursday of the week. Good for career advancement as the organisation values internal promotion than external hiring.

Cons: Safety hazards and concocting issues, very high TURN over rate. Lack of communication or RESPECT from upper management. Maintenance not been done properly. PoE not being given. Favoritism as well as impartiality. And no open door policy,at all.

Cons: Some managers are great from a technical point of view, but lack a lot of people management skills. 
Since it's a very popular company, some managers have a philosophy towards their employees of "if you're not happy, 300 people want your job".

Pros: Good company to learn a lot, let's you lead projects and suggests new ways of doing thing. 
Innovation is valued and recognized.
Younger age average makes it a dynamic work environment. 
Good trainings and career development up to mid-level manager.

Cons: A sink or swim environment, not much training on the products, long hours, not having the right or old tools in place.
Advice: Need to watch who you hire in a National role as they didn't have enough experience dealing with current staff, felt like I was bullied (in this team) and this person is very passive aggressive. Never gave any coaching or training. This person should not be there!
Pros: The L'Oreal brand has great product allowance, amazing incentives plus a great sales commissions.
Have friends for life as we had a great field team.

Cons: Poor Management 
Very Less employee incentives
Advice: Candidate considered for managerial position should have leader ship qualities. In loreal, a candidate deems fit for managerial position based on his seniority and experience - regardless of the fact that whether he or she can lead/manage team or not.

Secondly, Employee's are more important than customers/consumers.
Pros: Work Delegation - Managers delegate most of their tasks to their Juniors. Helping them grow faster
Experience - beside learning one's work, new starters or mid level employees are exposed to higher management which helps them become more confident and grow.

Pros: The company really value hard working and talent acquisition.Everything is possible in this company, You have to just focus on your career aspirations..

Pros: Very talented people, interesting products, the best training you can get, you make your job description as you wish.

Cons: Office politics, no objective employee evaluation, bad office atmosphere, people's aggressiveness

Put competent, high skilled managers as team leaders instead of people with just great taste.
Pros: Continue strive for excellence, strong marketing department

Cons: Office is noisy, management has a crippling lack of technical awareness, HR is severely incapable of thinking out of the box, getting new software approved is really difficult.
