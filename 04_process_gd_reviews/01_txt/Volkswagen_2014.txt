I think the management used in Volkswagen by some managers is just brillant as they try to put you at the best of your performance. you will participate all the travels and most the car dealer network visits and these kind of things. Today I can say that I gained in maturity and changed a part of how I was working. Also the end of the months is an exciting moment to live in the automotive industry.
