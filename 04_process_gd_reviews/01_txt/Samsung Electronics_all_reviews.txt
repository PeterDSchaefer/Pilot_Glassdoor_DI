Pros: Benefits go down the drain

Cons: High Pressure: The fast-paced and competitive nature of the tech industry at Samsung Electronics can be quite demanding. The high expectations and tight deadlines sometimes led to a stressful work environment.

Work-Life Balance: Due to the demanding nature of the job, maintaining a work-life balance was challenging at times. Long working hours were often required to meet project deadlines and achieve goals.

Organizational Hierarchy: The company's large size and complex organizational structure sometimes made decision-making processes slow. Navigating through the hierarchy to implement changes or get approvals could be time-consuming.

Job Security: As with many large corporations, job security can be an issue due to the constant drive for innovation and restructuring. This uncertainty can be a source of concern for employees.
Advice: None
Pros: Innovative Projects: Working at Samsung Electronics provided the opportunity to be involved in cutting-edge technology and innovative projects. This exposure allowed me to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and gain valuable experience in a highly competitive field.

Professional Growth: The company offers a dynamic and challenging environment that promotes continuous learning and professional development. The emphasis on excellence and quality helped me enhance my skills and grow in my career.

Global Impact: Samsung Electronics is a global leader in the tech industry, and being part of this organization allowed me to contribute to products that have a significant impact worldwide. This experience was both rewarding and inspiring.

Collaborative Culture: The work environment at Samsung encourages collaboration and teamwork. I had the chance to work with talented and skilled professionals from diverse backgrounds, which enriched my professional experience.

Cons: This review considate a few common feedback by peers who left. The department is toxic due to the head (G****l). 
Scolding, gaslighting is a norm.
Top management tried to prohibit such behavior, but ended up only moving occurrence from public to slightly secluded area.

Poor career path as higher position normally held by korean. 

The subsidiary culture is inclined to pleasing management to HQ. New project launch each year just for the sake of reporting and KPI. management will highly focus on the project when it is 'seen' by HQ. Previous in progress projects will be neglected, and the person who handles the project will suffer. 

As I didn't work in another department, these comments are only applicable to innovation teams in SME .But the turnover is high as a whole subsidiary.
Advice: Look into high turnover department, give proper training for the head, or assign someone who are actually capable.
Pros: Good colleague. But most of them left.

Cons: - Terrible local management. Yelling, screaming and passive aggression are normal and to be expected. 
- Micromanagement is a standard. You should do what you are told to do, but when that does not work - it’s your fault.
- All the rumors about local Samsung are true.
- Aside from bonuses, you get no benefits. You have to pay participation for health insurance, and there is nothing else. 
- I’m not sure if anyone used their vacations days (bare minimum of 20), you should be grateful you are using any at all.
Advice: Advice is for HR to do their job. It is unbelievable how the bounce rate in some teams is super high and no one is doing anything.
Pros: - Bonuses 
- Big system, you can learn how everything functions
- There are some great people, unfortunately suffering in this work culture

Cons: Nothing to say here :)
Advice: None
Pros: It is good to be here

Cons: One of the most toxic cultures I worked in. Colleagues and managers were emotionally burnt out, which was very draining. Bad and toxic behaviours are tolerated, especially from high management. I have seen countless people having to take sick leave from being over-worked.
The main issue is cultural, which comes from the Head Quarters in Korea. Their priority is NOT people or employees, even if they state it in their company values. All they care is about financial results, and squeezing every inch of blood and energy someone has to give. Additionally, there's no diversity at all. 90% of senior leaders are male, either Korean or white. This doesn't improve much in mid-management.
Don't be fooled by the name or by a high paycheck, and avoid yourself hours of therapy, anxiety and bad health. Stay away from Samsung.
Advice: None

No work life balance, you need always to check whatsapp and emails even at night, calls and meetings during weekend for unnecessary things that can be done during the week day.
The company on sense of urgency through out the year, you always feel that they will bankrupt at any moment(although they wont but they give that impression)

Cons: **Review: Avoid This Company**

Working at this company has been a frustrating and stressful experience. The direction changes every week, leading to confusion and a lack of clear goals. The high-pressure environment makes it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Moreover, the Korean boss is extremely bossy and often micromanages tasks, which adds to the already tense atmosphere. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a stable and supportive work environment.

Pros: Good work culture and benefits

Cons: ...however their values get trashed by the culture which is about running around like a headless chicken, spinning wheels, doing things that don't really add any value just to look busy. Expertise is frowned upon in favour of just spinning wheels and wasting time on pointless leadership team appeasement. Empowerment non-existent in favour of box-ticking for leadership. Very little learning and development at all after the probation period. The epitome of that definition of madness where they just want to do the same thing over and again expecting a different result...but they never get it. Understanding of data and statistics is almost non-existent, with the rule being that it's only used to prove the opinion of the person using it, never to open up learning to inform action. Leadership team is an assortment of people from failed enterprises, not successful and market-beating ones. No internal job move opportunities unless you've been on the grad scheme, then it's a case of rolling out the red carpet. Made a big song and dance about having work-life balance but then those without kids or a significant interest in life outside the 8-6 set the tone for what's expected and aggressively hound those whose work isn't their life. Any expertise you offer will at best be slyly appropriated by the audience and no credit will be given to the source at all - this is the worst organisation I've ever been in for this sort of thing; at worst you'll be openly told off for daring to have an original thought.

Cons: - Mentally prepare to see your hard work be destroyed by utterly incompetent local management, over and over again. - HQ leadership / mindset are very good, but often out of touch with what really goes on in this department. - Forget about career progression here, local management goal is to do as less as possible while getting away with it. If you oppose this mindset you will be targeted and gaslighted, they'll go far and wide to protect their little circle. - For these reasons this was by far the most toxic and depressing place I've personally ever worked, with reasonably crazy high turn-overs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You have been warned. That been said, my advice to you is: give it a shot and see how it goes, but always keep an opened mind and be ready to jump off.
Advice: Stop playing games or leave the chair to someone that knows what he's doing and he's willing to commit for the project and his team. Stop antagonizing HQ and talking behind their back, dumping on them the responsibility of your own failures. Stop the lies, manipulations and gatekeeping. Such behavior is not doing you any good, it promotes toxicity and ultimately will lead to your own downfall. Best of luck and farewell

Clear policies

Cons: Getting promoted is nearly impossible (there’s certain rules, like limiting the number of people to be promoted, etc). The salary increases, but not as much or as quickly as it should. Forced work from the office 3 times a week after work from home during covid had brought the company better results.
Advice: If there is a system to grade employees, but then you limit the amount of people that can be graded well (cause it implies promotion that is for only a few people), then it is not fair. People that do exceptional work are graded as “average” just because of this system. And there’s lots of very talented people in the AI team. Don’t force people to work from the office if they perform better working from somewhere else.

Cons: Samsung is the "big dog" in Korea, everyone wants to work there. It is a matter of honor to work there. So they work like slaves. They sleep at work under their desks as they are putting in 16 to 18 hr days regularly. If they get fired they won't easily get hired elsewhere. So they work incredibly hard and expect the same from everyone else. In Aus we have other options. What they do is not necessary. So they consider us lazy. I told them they are slaves. They hated me. They are 100% data-driven. It's not OK to hit 95% or even 105% you have to hit your target 100% every time. You get reviewed weekly, not monthly. If you can handle the stress it's fine. If not you won't last. If you can last though then other people know how tough Samsung is and you can get jobs easily elsewhere. They know you can handle.
