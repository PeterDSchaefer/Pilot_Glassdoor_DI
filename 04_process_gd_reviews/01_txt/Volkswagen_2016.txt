Cons: Will not be given any meaningful work or work at all. Most of the day in spent day dreaming. HR  and payroll is not transparent at all and attempts to conceal information from you. Extremely boring and worthless internship unless, you want to experience living in Japan. Almost all other interns will be people that major in  Asian Studies  with no knowledge on Business or Economics/the automotive industry. No "native" English speakers, most employees 98% of employees are either German or Japanese. So, if your Japanese is not very good, it will be a difficult experience. Toyohashi is an extremely boring part of Japan and if given the option, goto Tokyo. Although, your salary will not go very far in Tokyo. It will be 100% better than frequenting the same 3 bars that close at 11pm every weekend.
Advice: Don't needlessly hire interns. If there isn't a project or assignments for them, don't hire them.
Pros: Get to live in Japan
Respectful Colleges
Job offer likely with successful internship
No drug test
Paid(Most internships in Japan are unpaid or extremely low-paid compared)
They will find you housing if you work/live in Toyohashi.

Cons: The company desperately wants to grow at all costs ....at all costs! The attitude is that anything is able to be overcome with money and that means all resources are funnelled into paying for discounting cars or pushing more and more equipment into them to make them appealing enough to overcome buyer resistance to issues that are surfacing about quality and reliability. Staff turnover is high in some departments due to very poor management.
