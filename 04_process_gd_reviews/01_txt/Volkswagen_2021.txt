Advice: None
Pros: Nice Colleagues to work with

Cons: There are 20% old fashioned macho types which still have the old german mentality (from before 1979) which think women are below them. These discriminating bullies are still around, also destructive people from the old management culture, which brought the company to its knees, and with their attitude they destroy the team spirit and demotivate the surrounding team. When these people are managers, they are there for their own gain; they change the position a lot. Although there are also good ones who care for their employees.
Advice: Telling the press that the old culture is being changed, and making cool shows with famous people, doesn't change the fact, that the old culture is still there. Ensuring that the old-mentality managers do not get important positions would be one step ahead. It is not serious and makes no good impression to the outside world to make a top manager responsible for software engineering who has very little clue about software engineering.
Pros: Remote office work possible. Very family friendly. Most of colleagues in Germany are very good colleagues. Very strong workers' union.

Cons: No true people managers, only target obsessed types with no knowledge of teams jobs, processes, or people's skills. V fast paced, overly complex processes and systems, cumbersome working practices, and the most over the top interview format for jobs that are all much of a muchness. Anyone would think they are carrying out vetting for CIA the length and gruelling nature of their interview processes - when they are generally all pretty similar admin jobs. 
Day job - expect to encounter old fashioned business processes, and expect a fierce blame culture.
Advice: Start recruiting true people mangers - with people skills.
Pros: Car ownership schemes are handy if you are without wheels.

Cons: -Low pay, no salary increase unless you're a suck-up. HR is not fair with benefits and pay.

-Rare that you'll get career growth
Advice: -Make better business decisions

Cons: Lack of training, laziness, bad process.. depends on the click factor, you can do better or worse depending where you are

Pros: Great team, can be decent money if traffic is there and flood hasn’t happened.. be resilient, tough game

Cons: Too inflexible. UK decision making dictated by Factory. Teams and departments operate in silos.
