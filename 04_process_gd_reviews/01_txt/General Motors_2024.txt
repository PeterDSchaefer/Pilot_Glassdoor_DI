Cons: No cons to note at this time.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company with tons of opportunities for an engineer.

Cons: Although I worked on some interesting projects during my time there, the development timelines were so long that I didn't feel like I got a chance to see any of my design changes implemented into the vehicles. Outside of that, the Michigan cold is definitely a con if you're not from Michigan. Otherwise no real cons.
Advice: None
Pros: I was hired into the TRACK rotational program and my first job was in the CAE group. The leadership was supportive and helped me figure out my career objectives. They also allowed me to work on challenging and high-exposure projects.

Cons: Training and Development: While there are training programs available, some employees feel they are not sufficient or relevant to their career progression.

Work-Life Balance: Although there are flexible work arrangements, some employees still struggle with maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

Resource Allocation: There can be issues with the allocation of resources, with some departments feeling underfunded or understaffed.

Cultural Consistency: The company’s culture can vary significantly between departments and locations, leading to inconsistencies in the employee experience.
Advice: None
Pros: General Motros offers competitive salaries and comprehensive benefits packages

Cons: Senior leadership has been passing down edicts without data to back up the decisions 
We have been through 4 reorgs in the past year
We were forced to return to office while the leadership continued to be filled with fully remote positions
No clear company direction
We were told that we needed to save 2 billion dollars by reducing the workforce and cutting other costs. They said they couldn't afford the Union's demands. Then, as soon as the deal with the union was signed, they announced a $10 billion stock buyback. 
It has become clear that corporate values and company policies only apply to the workforce.
I personally do not like living in southeast Michigan. It's expensive, it's far from any outdoor activities. 

If I have to work for a company that won't include the workforce in decisions and will generally mistreat their workforce, I would at least like to live in a place I enjoy.

Most internal positions that we can apply for are only open to lateral moves, becoming very hard to get any sort of promotion.
Recent raises have not kept up with inflation at all
Advice: Back up your decisions with data. Don't lie to us. If it is just a command, then say that, don't lie and redirect.
Pros: I like my direct managers and coworkers
The pay and benefits are good

Cons: -was on a team where we were changing project every two weeks for a period of 6 months to a year. That meant we learned a lot but were masters of nothing. 
- whole building was laid off after being told there were no more layoffs. So current upper management is not very trustworthy.
- not flexible about remote work
Advice: None
Pros: -got hands on experience on a lot of different technology (Java/springboot angular react etc)
-great people all willing to help 
-if you’re interested in a different career choice they are willing to work with you to find you a spot on a different team that matches your interests
-great benefits and decent bonuses 
-work life balance was excellent 
*this is from the college entry level perspective

Cons: Pay isn't up to level it should be. Depending on team your in your growth and promotions are decided not based on your work. Your work load greatly varies depending on your team. Leadership chases newest coolest trends instead of working on core product and bettering that. California Leadership treats rest of the company as less than them.
Advice: GM should stop chasing and getting apple laid of people they release code to prod once in year.  It doesn't really compare.  You can create bad company at anytime. Just remember the reason people come to GM for reason leverage those instead of swimming with same way.  Long term it will help GM.
Pros: work on devices that people take there families in instead of hold them in there hands. Tech is cool and interesting.

Cons: Hires talent for one role and then places them into a completely different one.

Cons: Chaos management or leadership brought by SLT since end of 2022,
And the forced back to office policy caused center or site couldn't provide enough cubes to fit everyone which means you have to share cubes or use hotel cubes when you back to office. While the policy required 3 days back and 2 days remote still seems working fine but if 5 days back office I can guarantee not a center will have enough workplace for everyone to sit down.
Advice: Direct report basically what I experienced are super nice people, even upper to some senior manager and director level.
But things changed when leadership level up to SLT, GM colleagues knows well recent times.
Pros: Good work life balance
At average or bit higher salary at local area, fair though not very high compare to Bay area, WA, etc;
Besides, direct report basically have good support and co-workers are super friendly and willing to help and listen.
Also provided many resources for self-learning and training programs as well.

Advice: None
Pros: Good working environment to work

Cons: Complex corporate culture with a lot of bureaucratic hurdles.
Advice: None
Pros: Good experience with managers and good benefits.

Cons: My latter 2 years on the other hand were terrible. Upper management was constantly pressuring our managers to make us work faster all while threatening layoffs and lying about the state of the company. The latter half of my service at GM I did not feel valued at all as an employee and if the same culture persists I would never recommend anyone work there.
Advice: Be more transparent and stop lying about whether layoffs are happening. Value the human beings who are working so hard for your benefit.
Pros: My first year at GM was pretty chill and I was working on interesting projects and was given a lot of room to learn.

Cons: Local union sucks
Management doesn’t care
Hard physical work
Advice: None
Pros: Union benefits are great. Once out of temp status pay is good

Cons: Deadlines are always hard to meet

Cons: Toxic work environment with stack ranking seniors vs new hires

Cons: I do not have any Cons.

Cons: Can be very difficult starting here with no experience as your fate relies solely upon the luck of which team you get placed and how familiar they are with people new in the field
Advice: Learn how to treat people that have no experience in their field. Also for senior management, more transparency would reduce work anxiety by a lot.
Pros: Perfect place to work for experienced people within their field, generally very relaxed environment where you set the precedent for how hard your work will be.

Cons: Not enough benefits compared to software industry
Advice: None
Pros: a great place to work

Cons: So far everything is good
Advice: None
Pros: Good Benefits, Great work-life balance, Hybrid.

Cons: none at this time right now
Advice: None
Pros: Work life Balance
Good Pay for the area

Cons: Roles can be extremely siloed. Becoming an SME in your own area of the business often tunnels the utility you can provide and removes the potential for new skills to be developed. Your skills become less and less transferable if you don't prioritize your own professional development on the business side of the company.
Advice: Reversing the commitments made in recent years such as keeping annual salary raises consistent with inflation and allowing for permanent work from home solutions has created a sense of distrust with senior leadership.
Pros: GM's benefits package, salary commitments, and level of responsibility granted to new employees is unmatched. Especially for students with undecided futures and general business degrees, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to take on managing my own sector of the business in many other companies.

Cons: Senior leadership is inconsistent and outright lies sometimes. Lower pay than other places
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is good. Lots of teams to switch between over time

Cons: No work/life balance. The culture here is horrible. They come up with a new way to lay ppl off every 6 weeks. Everyday at work is like clocking in at the Hunger Games. Avoid this place if possible. Find an employer that actually values you as an employee.
Advice: Why bother? They don't care.
Pros: In this current job market, it's better than being unemployed.

Cons: EV transition has been a disaster.
Advice: None
Pros: Great Pay and solid leadership.

Advice: None
Pros: Great pay (for the area), little to no overtime required (depending on your role), getting to work in a field that is actually newly emerging with lots of potential (EVs), plenty of different areas to work in.

Cons: Dog eat dog culture. Stacked ranking, Mandatory “underperfoeming” ranking of employees
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay, hybrid office requirement

Cons: I don't feel elevated by the talent there. There are some very talented people, but it feels like most of the people are there because they couldn't find any other jobs, and it shows. Additionally, there aren't many growth opportunities.
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, great work life balance.

Cons: “Return to work” policy with no exceptions eliminates or extremely limits opportunities for staying with the company or career growth there if you aren’t near a major office. Attempts at diversity feel performative because they aren’t backed up in practice.

Industry that is flailing around trying things (i guess every industry that isn't Generative AI or HW related to Generative AI is flailing right now)
Despite all the rolling layoffs and cuts, there are *still* a core group of people that are just not open to change.
Advice: I don't have a Harvard, or Wharton MBA, and I never worked for a "tech company" as a data scientist or a senior leader ... so why would management listen to anything I say lol? I can't juice the stock price, or magically change the "global competitive landscape and the headwinds we face". I am just here to be as useful as possible till I am inevitably laid off.

-the only requirement for working in vehicle assembly is a pulse, so buyers beware. I'm telling everyone i know to never buy anything manufactured by GM ever,

Pros: GM has competitive compensation and benefits. As a large complex company there are opportunities for diverse experiences and specializations.

Cons: Management is mainly a bunch of former sales people and accountants.

The software in the company is literally the worst I've ever seen.

Management doesn't actually understand how modern software development works and just chases fads and plays buzzword bingo. Why? Because they don't actually know what they're doing.

Due to how bad GM is, it's difficult to leave because most companies don't want to hire ex-GM. Terrible rep.

Cons: The downsides of GM is that it, like most companies, is always changing. Salespeople stay in roles from 6 months to 2 years maximum. Direction from Detroit were always done from their perspective, not realizing that a smaller office has different needs. It was challenging to stay within company guidelines when those guidelines were drawn from farther away.

If you are passionate about cars it is amazing to see the latest innovations and be a part of it. The small office atmosphere for the Sales branches had a feel of a cooperative small office.
