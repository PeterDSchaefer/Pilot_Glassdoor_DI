Cons: - Big organization with some slow processes and in the middle of a reorg at the moment.
- The company is "Gothenburg-heavy", most of the decisions are made there, and the Stockholm office lacks some perks they have in Gothenburg (on-site restaurants, gym facilities, etc.)
- Stockholm office is too sterile (plain white walls, grey floor carpet, no decoration, no colors).
- I miss some perks I had at my previous employers (tech education budget for courses and conferences, massage in the office, language course, gym membership, top-notch computer and phone, fika, Friday beer, hack days, meetups, swag, etc.)
Advice: The digital transformation is a good step, but maybe try to make the company and the office a bit more "trendy" so you don't have to solely rely on high salary offers when it comes to attracting young talents.
Pros: - Good office location in downtown Stockholm; free fruits, coffee and soda; playing room.
- Decent work equipment (Macbook Pro and iPhone, but not the newest models like at other companies ).
- Nice, talented coworkers, international environment.
- Meaningful product, interesting project (mine at least is).
- Really good salary (Volvo Cars is able and willing to pay the price of the best talent, they seduce people from top Swedish tech companies like Spotify, Klarna, King, iZettle).
- Perks (pension contribution, annual bonus, discount on cars, etc.)

Cons: 1. Culture discourages working from home
2. Hard to increase salary while under contract. 
3. Architects have way too much control over the day to day work and implementations of the software developers.
4. Overtime requests are quite common (once to twice a year).
5. Not much fun or perks at the office
6. Office space and area (Torslanda) is boring and too far from the city
Advice: More autonomy to software engineers.
more perks in the office. (breakfast, snacks, music...etc.)
More software engineers closer to the city to be in par with other software companies
Pros: 1. Everything shifting to Agile and therefore things are moving a lot faster
Teams are having more and more autonomy to build products
2. You manage your own time.
3. Easy to change jobs within the company.
4. Management encourages to build competence (pays for courses, books and provides rewards for passing courses)

Cons: Auto industry is experiencing a disruption and Volvo Cars is not fully ready for it. Currently working at the autonomous driving department, which means major part of the job is securing the delivery from the suppliers (integration/testing/analysis) to guarantee the car safety, but not much of real technical development. There is a lack of personal competence development as an engineer. Obscure future about the merge with Geely Auto.
Advice: Vertical integration with suppliers, further remove the workforce redundancies / duplicate functions within the company or subsidiary companies.
Pros: Care and respect for people. Nice and competitive colleagues to work with. Good sales number so far until Oct 2020, so the business runs well.

Cons: If you are a serious software developer, please keep away from VolvoCars. This is a quite traditional company. Most managers did not have a strong background in the software area, even in sometime, they refuse to do the change as a software company. 
Lots of people only have the ability to talk, open the meeting, As a developer, please keep away from this company.

By the way, this is the first company what I have meet, the ScM was a dedicated role, whose jobs is talk, talk, talk.......
Advice: Please try to learn some knowledge of software engineer. give respect to the software engineer instead of dedicated ScM.
Pros: work/life balance. work/life balance.work/life balance.work/life balance.work/life balance.

Advice: None
Pros: Equal opportunity employer. Rich history and prestige  building the world's safest cars. Starting an exciting new phase into making only electrified vehicles from 2021.

Advice: None
Pros: It is almost what you expect from a corporation: good benefits, international community, lots of projects to work with and etc

Cons: To slow moving company. Many different areas of development and it is slowing the machinery down. It needs to review its dev processes and let management get much more hands on until processes and flows move swiftly.
