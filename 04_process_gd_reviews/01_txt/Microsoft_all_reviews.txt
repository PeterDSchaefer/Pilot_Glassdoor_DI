Cons: Ambitions are such that no one cares to finish what they start. Everyone is always looking for the next shiny object and every product you get to work in is always frustratingly unpolished and incomplete.
Advice: Stop promoting based on ambitions and initiatives, start promoting on what was delivered.
Also, ban "participation awards" and the self congratulatory emails for should the very basics, and the widespread sugarcoating where even a massive, predicted and avoidable failure is described as an achievement.

Advice: None
Pros: You can find good and bad teams at any company, but the fact that there is a top down value placed on work life balance and employee welfare really does have an effect on team culture. I remember my first year on my current team we were all very overworked and stressed, and in our yearly survey our team and org put very low scores for WLB.

Cons: Microsoft health insurance is VERY GOOD, but in many occasions, it's complicated to get your benefits. Most of providers won't accept it at first, even tho you can submit the claims to get reimbursed later for 99% of them. But that's time consuming and mostly a waste of time for the providers to have back-and-forth communications with you to confirm whether they can take you in or not. Therefore, it ultimately affects employees' productivity by distracting us to spend time on worthless work.

Cons: Getting promoted is tough. It's not enough that you deliver but you're expected to and keep your skip manager know about this. This is because your direct manager is busy with his own leveling-up. In my first 3 years there, our direct _did_not_ even introduced us to our skip.

Pros: In my current role right now, here are the pros which I can also see pretty much from our sister groups (groups within the same org)

- flexible -&gt; as long as you deliver results on time, nobody cares where you are and what you do during the day;
- resources availability -&gt; you're in one of the biggest companies in the world and this should be a given ;)
- great benefits --&gt; &gt;my fave is the backup care (they've increased the hours for child care under Bright Horizon significantly after Covid) and the $1200 well-being allowance

Cons: Well below average pay in the tech industry
Your manager generally only cares about their own next move
People in the company seem think they are superior to employees at other company which is funny and take such pride in the Microsoft logo itself. Microsoft became their identities and it's sometime unbearable
Diversity and Inclusion: This is very INTERESTING here. because they do hire people with diverse background. I know someone in HR and I've been told by her as well as seen it myself that someone that is way more under qualified will get hired because they fulfill certain diversity quota. I personally know a friend who fulfill these "criteria", she has gone on an one month vacation without actually taking days off, manager noticed this and she still proceed to take one more week.

Advice: Microsoft is growing rapidly and won't slow down any time soon. Keep track of your people and treat them well - that delivers a better ROI than anything else.
Pros: If you are knowledgeable in the Microsoft ecosystem, working at Microsoft itself is the place to be. I'm compensated very well, have flexible working hours, and have been given the unique tools I need to succeed. I think I'm appreciated and compensated fairly for the amount of value I provide, which isn't very common these days.

Advice: None
Pros: If you want to hustle and overdeliver (at least this is the fact in sales) then you can. And the company will recognise and promote you. I have seen rapid promotions with multiple top talents. Very rewarding.

Cons: Compensation is not as high as some competitors
Advice: None
Pros: Culture, Growth Opportunities, Connections w/ Leadership

Cons: Salary compensation takes a big dip between years 3-6 which is when you see most folks at Microsoft leaving. I left close to year 4 to get my fair market price. Most people come back to Microsoft as a Senior PM or higher for work life balance and to chill. The majority of new hires have more than 7-10 years of experience. I noticed that I saw more Senior and Principal PMs than PM 2s towards the end of my career. Let that sink in. 

Microsoft is a Service provider. They care more about supporting more and more platforms and languages aka growing horizontally ("We need to support a Python on App Service, and Rust on App Service... and every other language and version!") than making what they have into a spectacular product. .NET releases and support takes up big chunks of dev time. Resources tend to get spread thin with so many things to support and less progress is made from a customer experience and feature set standpoint. 

The upper leadership moves very slowly and doesn't like taking risks. If you're a fast mover, you'll likely feel "slowed down" or "asked for further justification as to why it fits on the current roadmap" very often by upper leadership. If you're frustrated by this,
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft was so valuable in teaching me skills I could use to be an effective program manager at scale. Getting to interface with an external product with thousands of customers has been awesome and I've gotten to learn how to collaborate and create roadmaps with the technical writers, software engineers, and fellow PMs of my product. I also really loved getting to dive deep into customer telemetry and come up with data-driven decisions. Microsoft has a great infrastructure to do so.

I was fortunate enough to be a PM right out of college in Azure Developer Division which focuses on Developer tooling. I think Microsoft set me up with the enterprise-level industry experience that has made me a competitive candidate out in the market.

The people there are very intelligent and work hard within the bounds of a VERY healthy work life balance. People take plenty of vacation and days of throughout the year. I've loved the folks I've worked with for the most part and managers are awesome!

Cons: Many managers at the principal and above level do not exhibit those company values. In those same bands, it's common to see constant land grabs and people forcefully inserting themselves into workstreams to "add value."
Advice: None
Pros: Could be a con, but I love the inclusive and liberal values the company pursues. As a culture, with their training, semi-annual reviews, etc. there is a wide range of ways that try to make sure you understand and exhibit the values they espouse. Amazing benefits as well! It's great to feel like you're working for a company that is driving toward a greater good.

Cons: Many groups are over worked; new features prioritized over product stability
Advice: Don't rest on existing processes; work on improving them.
Pros: Team work prioritized. Management is supportive.

Cons: DTO, less flexibility of work
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Chill environment, a place to rest and best

Advice: None
Pros: It was great to work there

Cons: Have not grown/expanded as an engineer.
Advice: None
Pros: Kind company, and good perks.

Cons: It is a great company to work for, but a terrible company to get hired by.
Advice: None
Pros: Broad diversity of job opportunities (when we're hiring).

Cons: Management encourages and rewards a timid approach to new features and is self congratulatory for tiny shifts in metrics. We don't stay the course long enough to see the vision for a project end-to-end and ultimately ship watered down fragments to test the concept, which never gets revisited. There's a pervasive culture of leading with 'no' and risk aversion
Advice: Committed to the full scope of projects. They tend to have much bigger payoff for customers.
Pros: We're bringing in more diversity through the intern program. 

The company is very inclusive. A few examples: Every major event has both subtitles and a live ASL translator. Pronoun usage is encouraged to be inclusive to trans folk. There is a specific hiring program for autistic individuals.

- Large scale means slow moving, many hurdles and processes to get changes and developments into production (rightfully so, but can reduce enjoyment)
- Success of Azure has changed culture to be a bit more "results" oriented (You won't get acknowledged for addressing fundamentals)

The female employees were told that they would lose their jobs if the customer returned to factory.

Advice: How good your life will be depends entirely on your manager.
If you are unlucky your tenure will be short.

Microsoft does reorgs yearly it seems.
The management does not seem to match people with teams very well after a reorg.
If you end up in a team that is not a match the you are stuck and will have to look for another job.

Finding another position inside Microsoft will require that you interview again, exactly as if you applied from outside Microsoft.

There are many companies that pay much better and offer more interesting work.

I cannot recommend Microsoft.
Pros: Reasonable work life balance if you are in the right team

Cons: Pay is a bit lower
Advice: None
Pros: Believe in the things you do

Cons: Too much work, busy schedules/
Advice: None
Pros: Great environment they say, I think its true.

Cons: Vaccine mandate; Chaotic product planning; Bad Work/Life balance; Internal tools can be terrible; Politics win over technical excellence
Advice: This is advice for GPM (Group Program Manager) / skip-level managers on my most recent team in particular:

Don't sit in an ivory tower, separate from the day-to-day realities of engineers. Structure your communication channels in Teams such that the team actually feels like a team. For unknown reasons, our communication was spread out over multiple Teams groups: my team was forced to keep its channels in a Teams group for the larger org; I have no idea where the other engineering teams communicated with each other. I wasn't even sure what our org structure looked like - who worked on our product across the globe. We should have had an All-Hands meeting once per quarter - not once per year. Or maybe an update email here and there.

Perform user research BEFORE you ask engineers to implement a feature. On my team, most of the features we implemented got cut just before or just after they were finished - because user research had only just finished their testing (without using the stuff we had just built - so building it was unnecessary). Lots of engineering time was wasted, and it was demoralizing.

In addition, don't keep piling pressure on engineers along the lines of "We should have shipped already!" when PM / design / user research haven't even decided what we should be building!!! It's laughable to have a fixed launch date when you don't even know what your new product wants to be.

And if PM / design go through the process of cutting features in order to speed up the time to market, maybe involve engineers in that process. Otherwise you might end up creating MORE work instead of reducing it!! Re-designing an entire website &amp; adding new features in response to feature cuts is NOT how you reduce work for engineers!!

The good news: My immediate manager was competent. Most GPMs and skip-levels at Microsoft are more competent than the leadership of my most recent team. It was a mess.
Pros: Nice People; WFH; Job security; Yammer (internal social media); Lots of DLs/groups; Mature engineering practices

Cons: When there's a re-org happening, cross your fingers and wish that your nice boss doesn't get kicked out. Nothing worse than a dishonest and selfish manager that only seeks his own benefit.
Advice: None
Pros: It really depends on which team you work in.

Cons: Pay for work experience is low.. can't retain experienced folks
Advice: None
Pros: Ethical company Everything is ok .. no extremes Good intelligent people to work along Enough Flexible work environment

Cons: Slower career progression, none, n/a
Advice: None
Pros: Learning, Competitive pay, Team spirit, Inclusive, Diverse

Cons: Unfortunately culture can be quite different between teams. So if you land in the wrong team with the wrong leaders, it can make your life hell....
Advice: Please find leaders who truly embrace Microsoft value and not just talk about it during Poll time.
Pros: Culture can be quite different between teams. If you land in the right team with supportive peers, you'll enjoy the work.

Cons: Internal politics can be hard to deal with
Advice: None

Pros: Management does actively care about individual growth and well-being

Cons: Promo velocity low especially once you get to L65
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance across

Cons: the location is not bad
Advice: None
Pros: it is ok to start with

Cons: The main complaint I hear from people leaving Microsoft is that they want to make more money or get promoted. 

As I mentioned in the pros, turn over at MS is pretty low by design. But that does mean that compared to other places, the opportunity for promotion and big raises is smaller as well. Generally people either leave by year 2 or stay for 7 to 8 years at least. There's a lot of people who have been there for a very, very long time. 

Also, good work life balance and culture is the stated goal at Microsoft and most teams seem to follow it, but not every team is the same. 

There are a lot of different teams at MS and reorgs seem to be fairly common -- though it seems about the same as at any large company, not particularly bad here.

My team only just started doing sprints. For the previous year plus I've worked here, I've struggled without the framework of agile that I'd become used to at previous work places. It's getting better on my team, and I know that's super team dependent as well.
Advice: This is a great place to work, but only because I'm on a team with a good manager. Most managers seem to be good managers here.
Pros: I started at Microsoft a few months into the pandemic and from day 1 I've experienced management as compassionate and committed to taking care of people as people. 

Crunch has been rare on my team. 

I work on a service large enough that I'm only the on call engineer about once every 3 months. 

Perks+ benefits -- a yearly reimbursement amount of $1500 for health and wellness things. Personally I've used it to reimburse meal kits, a peloton subscription, pet insurance, and a massage envy membership. The list is really expansive. 

The average tenure at MS on my team is around 7 years. People stay a really long time because the philosophy is that they'd rather have you take a break than lose all the expertise you've  gained. Being such a large company, the code bases are large and the history is long on pretty much all the projects. The longer they keep you, the more valuable you become. More on that in the cons.

There's plenty of room to move internally when you're ready to do something different, and internal hiring is very common.

Specifically on coming out as transgender at Microsoft:
My wife and I pay zero dollars for our health insurance and have a copay of $20 for any doctor in the Kaiser system. The trans healthcare is especially affordable -- just $100 for any of the gender reassignment procedures. The wait lists are about 6 months for a transgender surgical consult, which isn't terribly short but it's certainly worse other places.  

There's an internal transgender community that has worldwide members. They've been an incredible support and place to belong. Changing my name and pronouns has been completely painless. A lot of my team is virtual and I've never been misgendered or dead named. I didn't even announce it beyond telling my manager and saying in my team chat "Hey I'm going by X now and updating my pronouns to y" and everyone just said great, congrats, and started using it.

Cons: None what is ever. I can’t complain.
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: It's A Good Place To Work

Pros: Work life balance is awesome

Cons: This is not a tenured employer. So, when they decide to do cuts, it doesn't matter that you've been there 10 years and Joe from down the hall 3 months.... If your position is being eliminated you are out!
Advice: None
Pros: The benefits and work/life balance

Cons: It is a giant company. You may get to influence your immediate work group, but the company as a whole may make decisions you don't really agree with.
Advice: None
Pros: They really try and take care of you. Was recently terminated due to layoff of a 200+ person group. They gave a great severance package that will last us a long time (1 to 1.5 years).

Cons: Too ambiguous. "Grow your accounts" Okay. How? With what tools?
Unfulfilling. Job is very soft skills oriented so what you actually do can be tough to qualify.
Compensation. Has recently improved but still pales in comparison to complementary roles internally or similar roles externally.
Advice: None
Pros: Extremely flexible. You can live your life as fully as you could ever expect to as a full-time member of the work force.

Relatively low effort. The actual tasks are not difficult but you have to keep yourself on track with the communications and schedules

Cons: career growth is slow, unless you have a good sponsor
Advice: Improve upward mobility based on performance, boomerang employees get up-leveled far more easily and quickly than people who have been at the company for 5 plus years. Loyalty does not seem to pay here.
Pros: open, flexible work environment, no micro-management

Cons: Many old timers in top level management who talk about D&amp;I but do not follow it. Retaliated and bullied by manager for raising a D&amp;I issue despite strong evidence. HR didn’t act to rectify either. D&amp;I is just in the books but not in practice at all: Some internal processes are extremely slow. Promotions are highly subjective and seem based on tenure instead of performance. Got top performer of the year last year and after raising a D&amp;I issue within 3 months , moved to bottom most performer despite all kudos and appreciation from 360 peer feedback. Ratings are at the mercy of the manager!
Advice: Standup for what is right and do not support old timers just because of their tenure in the company . Makes the work place very toxic. Make performance ratings mix of a manger feedback and 360 peer feedback. Take away undue bullying power from 1st line management and do weighted average score from 360 feedback for performance.
Pros: Great company benefits. You can see some great people managers and leaders but also not so capable and very egoistic/arrogant who are still with the company due to their tenure. Leads to a toxic web of management circle sometimes due to their relationship with each other over years. Makes any good thing hard to surface after layers of politics.

Cons: no free food nothing much really good job
Advice: None
Pros: pretty good flexible hours flexible pay

Cons: most likely, not assistance in education for the family kids. community enhancement support
Advice: None
Pros: Family benefits, health insurance, retirement, incentives, breaktimes...

Cons: Is the Corporate BusDev team a deal team or a strategy team? The LT seems to be indexing toward the latter, not the former latetly. Newer hires are increasingly ex-consultants who are great at powerpoint but don't know how to manage or negotiate a deal or partnership, yet BusDev management expects them to advise CVPs and CEOs. Small size of the group means limited career opportunities especially once you hit Director level.
Advice: None

Cons: Mildly Political Corporate Climate - Difficult to Move Internally without Intensive Networking
Advice: None
Pros: Great Work Life Balance and People

Cons: Microsoft touts a diverse and inclusive community, but I found that it was not accurate. The executives may come from all different areas of the world, but they are all from similar educational backgrounds, which means it lacks diversity in "thought" and to push against that is very difficult, if you have been at Microsoft less than several years.  They recruit a lot of people to join the company, since they are losing people to the competition and better salaries, but people that have been at the company for more than 15 years, make it very difficult for new people with "ideas", so the politics are hard to navigate. There are people that are trying to bring innovation to the company, but most of them are frustrated and have given up trying to make any significant changes to the culture or innovation, until they can find a new gig. 

Since new people are not very much embraced by the people that have been there for a long time, progress is very very slow. Primarily, why Microsoft does well in the market, is because they have a good brand, due to the leadership of Satya, but that's the reason, not due to innovation.

Many long-time "Softies" lack expertise in their work subjects, so they utilize agencies for most of the strategy and execution. If you really want to participate in the innovation of product or strategy, then I would suggest working for one of their many consultant agencies.

People are on Microsoft Teams all day, every day. There's no respect for people's time and people are constantly late for meetings, since they are stuck on the previous meeting. Executives assume that all day meetings = work, which it doesn't. Work still has to be conducted, so people don't write or work , until the end of the day, when they can finally get off a Teams meeting.
Advice: If you really want to have diversity and inclusion at Microsoft, then modernize as the other tech companies have during the pandemic, and allow for different types of people of thought. Please look beyond hiring in Redmond for talent or forcing outside talent to relocate to Washington. Also, there are so many executives that have been at Microsoft for 25 years that hold back the innovation and don't allow for other's opinions, hire executives that you will respect their voices. It's good to listen  and stop suppressing new ideas.

Lastly, managers need to limit the amount of meetings they have in a day,  as well as , having all of their workers on the meeting, which many times are unnecessary. Staffs are afraid of not joining a meeting, since managers will penalize them. Managers need to trust their staffs and conduct less meetings to create efficiency.  Workers are burning out, since they are stuck on 7 - 10 Teams meetings per day. Having so many Teams meetings doesn't encourage a healthy work/life balance.
Pros: The health benefits and perks programs are great. Total compensation is comparative, but base salary is less than the other big Tech companies. For middle management salaries, it's a great place to be, but for executives, they are not as competitive as an AWS or Google.

Satya is great and truly is inspirational for trying to change the culture of the company.

Cons: Pay is less than expectation stock refresh is low
Advice: None
Pros: Hybrid work environment, WFH possibility good company culture No stack ranking

Cons: No Cons in my mind now
Advice: None
Pros: Good company, nice environment, good culture

Cons: But parts of the company are still shrouded in archaic styles, and there needs to be more emphasis on teaching middle managers how to lead with care and dignity.
Advice: None
Pros: The overall culture of the company is undoubtedly industry leading, and the C-Suite execs lead with transparency, and make it clear their culture is of importance.

Great work life balance and focus on D+I

Cons: To a very large extend, management at all levels, with only exception C-level) do not practice the model with their employees.
Advice: Truly embrace growth mindset, empathy, integrity, honesty, caring and positive intelligence.
Pros: High level leadership established a model Lead by Example, Coach, Care

Cons: not so stable as before
Advice: None
Pros: really an equal opportunity employer

Cons: good and bad at times
Advice: None
Pros: bad for some time but really

Cons: - the pay is quite low comparatively
- very poor stock refreshers mean staying long term isn't feasible 
- culture is very team and manager dependent
- re-orgs are common, meaning you can't count on your team culture staying the same
- pushes everyone to participate in diversity and inclusion initiatives but doesn't reward those who do
Advice: - recognize and reward D&amp;I work
- consider better stock refreshers
- the culture is good, but not good enough to justify the low pay
Pros: - culture of teamwork 
- prioritize growth over immediate success
- not a blame based culture

Cons: Need to think about it
Advice: None
Pros: Broad product lines W/L balance

Cons: Long hours sometimes. Lots of OT.
Advice: None
Pros: Team work is excellent. Staff are helpful.

Cons: Compensation is on the lower end compared to other FAANG companies
Advice: None
Pros: - Pretty good work-life balance especially in you're in an org which has mature products like Office
- No Micro-managers. Nobody stressing you about when you start work. Managers care more-so about your ability to get your work done, so highly flexible in terms of work hours.
- If you work on weekends, or after-hours that's seen as a negative because the idea is that you didn't manage your time wisely during the work week
- Unlike some other tech companies who are prioritizing employees needing to come into the office several times a week, Microsoft strongly adopts the hybrid model of work. You can choose to work fully in the office, half, or fully remote. Up to you and the discretion of your manager/org

Cons: Stuck up managers, could use listening to new (er) perspsectives
Advice: Open up to other perspectives, just because this is the only company you have worked in for all of your career doesn't mean that your opinion is the only valid one.
Pros: Great people to work with.

Cons: Bad managers some of them
Advice: None

Cons: It is retail, so many customers are difficult
Advice: None
Pros: Customers are nice. Played with new tech

Cons: Microsoft is a large company, and there are definitely still pockets of management that do not subscribe to the new culture, preferring to micromanage and exert a top down pressure to conform

Also, being a large company, your progress in your career is somewhat slower
Advice: None
Pros: Overall the environment at Microsoft is conducive to work life balance, and facilitates authentic connection and collaboration with coworkers

Managers mostly actually care, and your feedback is respected

Cons: some people have bad hygiene.
Advice: fire John.
Pros: The community in Microsoft is one of the best I've ever experienced in a workplace to date.

Cons: If you're on a service team, the on-call rotations can be pretty long and bad. If you're driven to write well-tested code, and hold your teams to high standards, you likely won't have the dev hours allocated to do so.
Advice: None
Pros: Work-life balance is pretty good, and benefits are great.

Cons: So far so good working for MSF
Advice: None
Pros: Good job working as SM at MSFT

Cons: Less experience than onsite intern
Advice: None
Pros: The mentor is really helpful

Cons: Microsoft has many reorgs where you will leave your team and be placed in another team.
You will have no ability to choose your new team and not even know until the day of the reorg which is your new team.
And switching teams is really hard, most times will require an entire interview loop.

Given the number of reorgs and the many random team reassignments it is very likely that if you stay long enough you will end in a bad team for you.

So, do you feel yourself lucky ?
Advice: When doing a reorg the affected people should have input into which new teams they end.
Pros: Good work life balance, assuming your manager agrees :)

Cons: not great at marketing hard to get things done

Cons: Nothing specific that I know so far
Advice: None

Cons: Work from home is dependent on CVP
Advice: Allow people to work how they'd like - remote, in office or Hybrid. Try hiring internally and support career moves. That's why your best talent is leaving.
Pros: Pay and benefits are best in class

Cons: Microsoft culture is not good. No accountablity.
Advice: The company is too big to have an actual culture. Your experience at Microsoft is dependent upon 1 thing - your manager. So, pick your manager well.
Pros: Good stability, good salary hard to get fired

Cons: Not competitive pay compared to others
Advice: None
Pros: A good work life balance

Cons: SLT lacks a cohesive vision for how to bring all of the products and services together to serve the customer
Advice: Customer is king. What have you one for the customer lately?
Pros: Vertically integrated company that has a lot to offer to its customers

Cons: - Your experience here is completely dependent on the team that you get placed on. They preach "growth mindset" at the VP level, and then by the team it trickles down to the individual contributors it is a toxic environment, "old school Microsoft culture". 
- Backstabbing and overworking is rewarded
- Often times 24 availability is required, but not listed as part of the job requirements
- Internal movement in impossible unless you are Senior level. You are ghosted even internally
Advice: Practice what you preach and stop rewarding VPs who overwork and pressure those they are responsible for.
Pros: + Good pay
+ Literally nothing else

Cons: Latest re-org was very upsetting on so many levels, does not feel like a lot of common sense was involved.
Advice: I do feel they are trying to “right the ship”. It’s just a little more painful than it probably had to be.
Pros: Everyone is very friendly &amp; helpful. Lots of proprietary tools to learn and a lot of work. But never boring if you are willing to seek out new opportunities!

Cons: no down sides just learning new things
Advice: None
Pros: the biggest reason is to communicate and problem solving and learning new things for the requirement of indusrtry

Cons: Become a virtual robot with no life

Advice: Reduce some of the demands for mandatory training, workshops, and learning that are sent on a weekly basis.
Pros: World-class organization, brilliant co-workers, culture fosters collaboration through a three-tier annual performance lens; your accomplishments, contributions to others, and how others contributed to your success.

Cons: Leadership can be hit or miss, and my leaders were very poor. Didn't feel like I got a fair chance at a promotion after outstanding contributions.
Advice: Make the Microsoft Store actually feel like part of the company, and do a lot more to ensure that the workplace environment is healthy both physically and emotionally.
Pros: Great benefits, including tuition reimbursement, discounts, and even some free services.

Cons: lower compensation compared to other tech company
Advice: None
Pros: decent place for growth at early stage

Cons: Many previous benefits like work life balance are starting to disappear. This exacerbates the tension over low compensation. Further there is a growing concern over new hires coming in with little to no experience at higher pay than high performing employees due to the discrepancy in retention and acquisition team budgets.
Advice: I would recommend adjusting the retention to acquisition team budgets as managers often in good faith will tell high performing employees to leave and come back in order to obtain market level compensation. This likely is costing Microsoft a tremendous amount and appears that Microsoft has to pay a premium for returning employees when they could have paid marginally more initially to increase employee satisfaction and productivity.
Pros: Microsoft prides itself on its culture.

Cons: Less Learning Rewards not always related to performance
Advice: None
Pros: Work Life Balance Moderate Pay Average Leadership

Cons: Needs improve in some aspect’s

Cons: This is a huge company so communication and collaboration is key.
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing inclusive culture and very smart people impacting the world.

Cons: Low pay and it seems it will not get any better..
Advice: Increase the pay for senior band technical scientists by 20-35% to keep your top talent or FAANG would be happy/honored to keep poaching your top technical talents .. Not many great engineer/scientists would stay with Microsoft long term due to the aggressive offers top companies make to poach MSFT technical talents. CEO has done very small to address the lack of competitive total pay for senior (level 64 -66) scientists/engineers at MSFT.
Pros: good work life balance.
smart people.

Cons: - As in other consulting jobs, the need to fulfill with utilization metrics can become overwhelming.

Pros: Everything was a good point in my view

Cons: Microsoft's mission is to empower every person and company to achieve more but it often doesn't practice that in reality.

Employee growth is touted as a vitally important part of their corporate culture with various constructs and processes that seem to also encourage this. However, no matter the policies, procedures or training, my experience has been nothing but the opposite.

In my time, i've witnessed ableism towards colleagues that had disabilities and even myself once I developed a disability that I partially contribute to my experiences.

I've also heard stories of Racism and discrimination too.

Managers, teams etc were always talking in secret, sabotaging each others projects. Referring to each other negatively. Playing political games to get things done and generally making my life miserable.

Eventually, I started struggling in my position beyond the above issues. I developed anxiety, stress and depression. The heightened level of anxiety in everything at work lead to me dreading starting work.

The pandemic actually helped, at least I didn't have to be physically in the same location as the people who were causing the issues.

During this time, I developed stress caused epilepsy. Too much stress I get a seizure... yay

My manager never helped with these issues despite me asking. 
My skip level booked some meetings with me but always left early and said they'd re-schedule. They never did.
HR of course is a no-go, they're designed to protect the company and don't really care about you.

I felt I had nowhere to turn to, with my mental health declining and my sense of self worth flying out the window I had to leave.

I'm exceptionally disappointed

Cons: upward mobility, corporate hierarchy, commute
Advice: None
Pros: good experience, good benefits, good vacation

Cons: There are so many side programs, labels, allyships, and everything else that it has become a drag on results and performance. Internal movement is hard as the internal hiring process is awful and slow.
Advice: Need to decide what the company engages on as a real issue - when every issue is a top priority issue, nothing really is, and it all becomes noise.

Cons: Lower base salary than average

Cons: If you’re not comfortable working in ambiguity then it can be tough. Senior management struggles to coordinate achievable goals.
Advice: None
Pros: I work in a group that is building a new product, so we don’t have the stress of maintaining an existing system. Tons of opportunity for growth. Engineering management is good

Cons: There's some legacy issues that still need to be resolved.
Advice: Continue to do the work that is being done to transform Microsoft!
Pros: Organized and experienced professionals lead the main functions.

Cons: Not a fan of the office politics. Work/life balance is nonexistent but this seems to vary by team.
Advice: Do a better job of compensating employees in proportion to impact.
Pros: Stable company with great benefits.

Cons: It can get boring at times
Advice: None
Pros: it's a well payed position

Cons: Nothing Nothing Nothing Nothing Nothing
Advice: None
Pros: Work culture Pay Peer Tech Benefits Comp

Cons: Let's be real. No company is perfect. Work is work. But for sake of not being "everything is perfect,"

- It's a huge company. The endless abyss of information, acronyms, jargon, etc can be obnoxious. Onboarding can be comical. Where do I find xyz? What's actually important? What version of comparable documents is the "right" one? But that's easily combatted by asking someone who knows.

- Huge company means lots of "hurry up and wait." Let's be honest, that's frustrating. You're bound to encounter differing opinions and such. "Looks good, but ope, now there's feedback from another group, and now we need approval from xyz. Glad I stressed about this yesterday when it turns out it's gonna sit for another week.
Advice: None
Pros: Whether they genuinely care about their employees as humans or not, they at least do a darn good job of acting like they do. Microsoft is a rare company that understands "if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your company."

- I dare you to find a better 401k match. 50% on any contribution amount, up to the government's limit. AND it vests immediately. It's yours from day one. Literally $10,250 of free money on top of normal compensation.

- Healthcare is great. Tier 1 in the US for sure. Maybe there's a couple companies out there with better coverage. But Microsoft doesn't charge you for it. Literally zero dollars out of the employee's paycheck. There's a fee to add a spouse or domestic partner denying their own company's coverage, but that's fair. Also no added cost for dependents. That's amazing.

Parental leave. They match the WA State policy of 12 weeks (+ more for birth mothers). It's super easy to take advantage of, and it's available Day 1 of employment. It's unfortunate that this benefit feels "special" in the US, but I'm thankful for it.

- Base is competitive. But actually competitive. Not how bs companies say it as a way to compete with you for the lowest pay possible. They get it. They need and want to get quality people, and keep them at Microsoft.

- Any negative culture stigmas from a couple decades ago are gone. The culture now is relentlessly supportive and accommodating. Work life balance is preached. We're all adults here, trusting other adults to do their job, regardless of what hours they need to do it.

- Signing bonus + stock bonus + annual bonus. Work hard, get more. Beautiful.

I've historically cringed at people who spewed love for their company on Glassdoor. It always screamed "I'm and HR drone posting fake reviews to cover up all the bad ones." But here I am. Not an HR drone, a real human grateful to be in the Microsoft bubble. Believe it or not.

Pros: Great company, awesome perks where I worked.

Cons: None, i can say for now
Advice: Continue to invest in your employees

Advice: None
Pros: Very open and supportive compared to years in the past. Focused on learning it all vs knowing it all.

Advice: Keep leading with empathy, it has proven fruitful.
Pros: Leadership allows you to define your work style and schedule, so long as you are on target to reach your goals. MS also provides great benefits and competitive pay.

Cons: Politics are a con for this firm

Cons: - disrespectful environment where bullying is tolerated - inclusion at MS means adding people to meeting, damaging what the word actually means in diversity and inclusion - stagnant pay, pushing good people to find something better

Cons: Toxic culture persists from Balmer era, "golden boys" are rewarded in spite of bad behavior, product silos are at war, outdated mindset, "somebody else will make it usable"
Advice: Conflict aversion doesn't solve the real problems the company is facing. You have to get rid of bad actors and remove cross company barriers or you'll never move forward.

Empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more cannot be accomplished with a stubborn insistence that the primary market is office workers and professional developers - especially after funding OpenAI.

The software supported is changing and being improved/updated so rapidly it's impossible to know it all, but with the right skill set it's not too difficult to find instant answers for just about everything

Wont push back to senior leaders and are very complacent. Also there are some managers that will use your work and present it as their work. The review and bonus structure is highly subjective and unfair.
Advice: Vet you managers better, left the company twice as I got stuck with bad managers who were only put in those positions for promotion and not for their leadership. Very subjective when it comes to reviews. A culture should be on results, should he objective and rewards should not be based on who is on your " country club"

Cons: Work-life balance, managers too empowered
Advice: The company is unmistakably amazing, it has outstanding values, great benefits, and an overall culture that makes you feel part of the family, you learn all the time and it has an amazing diversity and inclusion spirit. Work-life balance isn't so great, and you can end up working sunrise to sunset to meet objectives, and your results are only reviewed by your manager. Great managers give you the best experience of your life; not-so-great managers make life unbearable.
Pros: Benefits, growth, pay, stability, communication, flexibility

Cons: - Salary is not market-based
- Some of the coworkers and teammates are underqualified

Pros: + Moves you to North America to work in the HQ in Redmond
+ Highly family-friendly
+ Work/life balance
+ Very good social packages/benefits

Cons: If you're below a certain job level (e.g., L65), Microsoft is really cheap on your total compensation compared to other big technology companies like Meta, Alphabet, or Amazon. People have been leaving in droves during the great resignation to go to competitors that have been paying more, and Microsoft is now realizing it needs to do something to stop the bleeding of early and mid-career to competitors and startups. 

Despite knowing employees are unhappy with compensation in this high inflation &amp; high gas cost environment, the company leadership isn't doing anything transformational that makes Microsoft the leader when it comes to compensation. The company is doing across the board salary cuts between 10% and 15% for employees in certain states like Texas, Florida, and Georgia (no exceptions), and this is in no way beneficial to the employees in these states as they try to grow their presence and recruit people there.

Microsoft is also a "rest and vest" culture where there have been people who have stayed at the company for 20+ years and don't have to do much work. If you're looking for a place to increase your career trajectory velocity, definitely look somewhere else. Career progression is super slow at the company. If you've got an advanced degree, Microsoft won't compensate you extra for that either. Think more than twice before opting to take a job at Microsoft - especially if you're a new grad.
Advice: Stop being cheap and actually be competitive with your total compensation and benefits. Other big tech peers (and even startups) are steamrolling you in this category while senior leadership continues to tell people "think about the work-life balance that you get". It is frustrating and makes people feel not valued at all. I know you're thinking about keeping the SG&amp;A line item on the balance sheet minimal and trying to maximize net operating income by keeping salaries cheap, but it is a terrible long term strategy for attracting and retaining good people. Also, if you're going to cut salaries of people in different states without telling them (after they have moved there during the pandemic), at least come forward with explaining why you think their new lower salary is good and attractive for them. I know you wouldn't do that, but some explanation is better than no explanation.
Pros: I really like the benefits that are offered by Microsoft - they actually do a good job here. That is the only reason I gave 2 stars to the ratings for "Compensation and Benefits" - the benefits lift it up. Otherwise, it would be a one-star rating for that category.

Advice: If you want to retain the best talent, make sure there's vertical promotion for IC's in each business unit.
Pros: Growing business unit
Great people
Tools built for the role
Amazing benefits for family

Cons: Some of the tools we are required to use cause roadblocks, but I understand that they are important to ensure privacy.
Advice: None
Pros: Feel proud to work for a company that is so invested in D&amp;I and sustainability. And they added travel expenses to our health plan for states that don't give women freedom over their bodies. 90% of people I work with are bright, responsive, truly care about the customer.

Efforts are made to eliminate male candidates during interviews on "diversity" reasons. Even some male employees are made to leave the organization to be replaced by female employees again on "diversity" reasons. Hence "Diversity" is very feministically interpreted and implemented.

Cons: Still lots of former bad behavior, manager clicks and gossip, jobs are always changing and what's required of your role often changes and reorgs happen all the time, but employee's workload is still heavy to try and change and learn new requirements

Cons: Could be more inclusive and welcoming
Advice: None
Pros: They're into everything now and it shows

Cons: It's very hard to explain without having lived it, but it's all politics. It's who you know over what you know. People are quick to judge you based on your looks and attitude. I'm not sure how/why it's bred this culture but they're not as "inclusive" as they seem. They breed an incredibly competitive culture where it's the norm to be incredibly selfish and highly judgemental of everyone and their work (they call it "being critical" and "defining impact").

Cons: Your overall experience at Microsoft is very team dependent, with some organizations' actions contradicting the values set by the company's mission statement. This manifests in poor cross-team communication, misalignment of interests between teams, and tribalism. This leads to a poor collaborative culture where every team acts only in the best interests of their own team, and not for the company as a whole. How can you empower every person and every organization in the world if you can't even empower your own employees?

Compensation is not as competitive as other FAANG companies. While Microsoft comp is still very good compared to most non-FAANG companies, this signals that Microsoft is not willing to take the initiative to be competitive with their main competitors. What ends up happening is that the best talent ends up leaving for greener pastures and all the mediocre ones stay, causing a "brain drain" where engineering standards steadily decrease. Microsoft is not interested in retaining its best talents contrary to their claims.

It is much easier to interview external companies than it is to switch to different organization. If you want to transfer to a different organization within Microsoft (say, from Windows to Xbox), you have to apply to a job posting created by the organization of interest and go through an interview loop as if you're an external applicant. Assuming they even read your application, you being a Microsoft employee gives you no advantage as the loop does not take into account your positive Connects, manager testimonials, etc. I've made more progress in a few months' worth of external interviewing than I did trying to transfer internally for years. Yes, Microsoft is entrenched in various markets, but you most likely won't be able to enter most of them unless if you boomerang or have insider connections (which is outside of your control). Again, Microsoft is not interested in retaining talent despite Microsoft selling you on the idea that they want to keep and cultivate talent.

Work life balance is a hit or miss depending on several variables such as team dynamics, your seniority level, and the quality of your team's engineering processes. In my team, engineers are put in oncall rotations with little to no training in the product area, poor organization of information, and not being taught to take initiative in solving problems. This leaves the most senior, competent, and knowledgeable engineers being put on 24/7 virtual oncall where they can get pinged/paged/called/etc during off hours by engineers that are officially oncall but couldn't/wouldn't find relevant information themselves. I've even been texted several times to come online and help with an issue, WHILE I WAS ON VACATION!

Furthermore, if you're perceived as a competent engineer, expect to be stretched thin with increased responsibilities but little to no resources to deliver on said responsibilities. This led to competent engineers burning out while the mediocre ones are able to coast by. Even when brought up in one-on-ones, the issue was dismissed with a nonchalant "we tried but we can't fix it" response. It's almost as if Microsoft rewards mediocrity more than competency. There is an ongoing myth about Microsoft being the pinnacle of work life balance, but I find that it's mostly true if you're junior or are unmotivated.

Microsoft claims to be customer obsessed and seeks to offer a delightful customer experience, but my experiences with seeing poor development practices and seeing products fail the most basic use cases (implying a lack of quality testing) lead me to believe this is just another buzzword. Microsoft is more concerned about crossing off checkmarks and delivering fast rather than being honest about their products and taking corrective action. This leads to technical debt, loss of morale, and burnout.

On a slightly unrelated note; even during my tenure at Microsoft, I've favored competing products over Microsoft's counterpart. I'll use Google Docs over Word any day, Dropbox over OneDrive, and I ended up selling my Xbox One but kept my PS4. I'm not familiar with the teams behind those products, but based on my experiences here, I wouldn't be surprised if their lack of quality translated to my dissatisfaction with those products.

tl;dr your mileage may vary at Microsoft as each team is different, so be prepared to jump ship if your working conditions don't line up with their promises and your own expectations. I recommend Microsoft as either a resume booster or as a place to retire.
Advice: If you truly believe in the company's values such as customer obsession, cultivating talent, and growth mindset, walk the talk. Don't just talk the talk. Otherwise, employees who actually practice those values will leave for your competitors.
Pros: Good benefits like health care, 401k matching, donation matching, access to counseling service, etc.

Microsoft is entrenched in a wide range of markets from office productivity, gaming, search, mixed reality, etc.

Can find coworkers with a wide range of interests and hobbies outside of work, such as sports and gaming. Lots of internal mailing lists for different hobbies to facilitate meetups and community building.

Creative outlets in the form of yearly hackathons and The Garage, an independent group inside Microsoft that coordinates smaller hackathons and guest speakers relevant for certain topics such as game development and virtual reality.

Good place to retire or to jump start your resume.

Cons: Pay grade, slow career ladder
Advice: None
Pros: Pay, benefits, people, easy to move around latterly

Cons: Acceptable to really bad work life balance depending on the team.
Very aggressive environments created by teams for artificial purposes.
Very stratified teams based on language.
Adopt current trends and technologies quicker.
Advice: Improve work life balance.
Break up teams that have a very homogeneous make up.
Add quarterly surveys and trainings regarding diversity and inclusion efforts on teams. An hour video of training on diversity per year leads to really funny and insensitive comments and conflicts that might result in the company losing its reputation and worse.
Improve training opportunities for new technology.
Pros: Vast choices of technology to work on.
Lots of smart and productive people.
Beautiful main campus in the Seattle area.
Software teams able to make decisions without interference from upper management, at least at the medium and lower levels.

Cons: are you kidding me ?
Advice: None
Pros: super great and very good

Cons: Microsoft offers below average compensation. Their stated goal is to offer compensation that is the 66th percentile of their competitors. In a letter grate that is a D. The promotion opportunities at Microsoft are severely limited. The best way to get paid more is to leave and come back.
Advice: The reason you are losing employees to Google and Facebook is not complicated. The reason is because you refuse to pay us as much. Even after Satya's announcement of increased compensation, it still won't match what I can get by going to Google or Facebook. That is why I am voting with my feet.
Pros: The people are mostly nice.

Cons: Less pay than other tech companies, less interesting things to work on than companies like Google, etc
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance, great culture, amazing teams
