Pros: Global company, pay well, great calture, European flavour

Cons: Chaotic, disorganized culture, lack of direction within teams. You'll do the job for at least a year or two before you actually get the promotion. Heavy reliance on early talent to fill gaps puts strain on teams. Lack of transparency from senior management. The recent restructuring showed a major lack of strategy with many high performers let go and low performers kept putting major strains on teams and thereby PEOPLE. Tough work-life balance as the environment is unstable.
Advice: Lean into managers and seniors on teams when planning a restructuring to avoid leaving teams in shambles with select high performers left to keep fort with low performers staying on but not pulling any weight. Get transparent - none of the tough questions were directly answered, rather run around with foggy responses. Create a space for true, open, honest feedback from your employees, especially during the most difficult times. Stop tooting the benefits plan in compensation conversations, all large orgs and most small now offer benefits packages, this is standard industry practice. Make it right: Seek to bring back the major talent that was given away and eliminate the burden of low performers.
