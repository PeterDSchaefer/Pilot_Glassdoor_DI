Advice: Volkswagen wants to implement Toyota concepts to their processes, but this can only be done once management is seen as part of the team and not placed on a pedestal. Look at Toyota's management concept. Communication needs to be improved from top to bottom and with people having more of a input in the day to day decisions.  People also need the opportunity for guidance for a career plan. Maybe spend as much time on their people as they do on their product's quality. People need to feel save and valued at work.
