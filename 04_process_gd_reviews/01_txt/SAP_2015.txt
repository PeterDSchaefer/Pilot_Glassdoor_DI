Cons: I was recently hit with a reorganization and lost my job. SAP, up until 2014, had a strong history of no layoffs, due to it's Co-CEO arrangement with Bill McDermott (US) and Jim Hagemann Snabe (Germany). However, McDermott took over as the sole CEO in 2014, and that's when the cuts and reorganizations started.  It has heavily affected offices in Israel, North American and other locations. SAP is putting an "all-in" strategy into HANA and SAP Cloud, so it's beefing up those areas, while placing less focus (and investment) into other areas of the business (like Middleware tools, for example), so folks on those sides of the business are feeling the heat.
Advice: Resteer the SAP HANA and SAP Cloud Story back into what made SAP great in the first place, which was it's ERP/Business Suite vs all HANA. HANA is an in-memory database platform, which is not a solution to all customer's problems.  While continuing to build-out SAP Solutions with HANA and Cloud, I would recommend they refocus their energies back to what made them great and what their "core focus" was all along - their depth and breath of business solutions!
Pros: SAP has always been one of the better tech giants to work for. They are well managed, consistently ranked one on the Top 100 Best places to Work (here in North America), have
lot's of great talent and very professional caliber people there. They offer all types of roles, no matter what you do. I have nothing but good things to say about them.

Cons: I am in Sales at SAP. Sitting here on April 3rd 2015 our group STILL DOES NOT HAVE ITS COMPENSATION PLAN.  If you are from one of the companies they acquired you will not be treated right.  Internal system are awful.  You will be forced to use SAP's technology for your daily job and its absolutely mind numbing that companies buy some of this technology.  I was lucky to hit quota last year, but only 10% of the SF field reps made their quotas last year.  SAP's slogan is "RUN SIMPLE", but if you are working here expect the exact opposite.  One last thing.....Last year they told us we would not get commissions until May, which ended up being August.  We literally did not get our first commission check until August.  They pulled the same thing again this year.  As of right now we are being told that the first commission check for 2015 biz will not come until May....my guess is they will continue to drag this out.  All of this information is accurate and true....I hope this helps.
Advice: Any advice you have for management will not matter.  They are too big for your opinions to matter.  At the end of the day they want the stockholders to be happy and do whatever they can to keep the cost of a sale down.  Turnover is inevitable and will only hurt SAP over time.
Pros: I came over from SuccessFactors.  SuccessFactors was an incredible experience.  Great money, work/life balance, and you felt like you made a difference.  Over the last year SuccessFactors has been completely taken over by SAP, which has killed the culture

Cons: Process driven culture contributes to a lack of agility. More time is spent on internal selling versus external selling with our customers. It is very difficult to understand the products in your "sales bag" at any given moment and if not careful you can be positioning a solution you won't get paid on. Global deals are a train wreck and the sales split process take months to resolve and is a blood sport.  Virtual team sales model, while great to have, leaves a lot of dead weight and compensation for those who actually fail to contribute.  People are too busy and can never dig out of the pile, which mostly consists of internal, non-revenue generating garbage.
Advice: Enable your sales people to be in front of customers more by less reliance on duplicative reporting, tracking, and internal efforts.  Schedule less calls to prepare for calls.  Allow your front line sales managers to run their business and make difficult decisions - dont time them down in managerial report all day long.
Pros: Market leader with complete and proven portfolio.  Not afraid to acquire and integrate best-of-breed players.  Dynamic executives who clearly articulate vision and strategy. The global community remains centered on what is important in life and makes every effort to "give back" and support a cause.  The sales compensation plans are fair, as is the goaling. Sales management is patient in understanding that SAP solutions take time to sell - so long as you remain focused and "do the right things". Executives are fun to take on sales calls.

Cons: There is a constant drive to re-invent the company and the recent acquisitions of Sybase, Successfactors, Ariba and Hybris were good choices.  The challenge has been to maintain the brand recognition and strengths of the products amidst the absorption of those organizations into the core of SAP.  Integration has been tough and after a few years the product development goes away and the company changes focus.  This really diminishes the value of the purchase and confuses the customer base in the process.

SAP appeals to many large companies and is therefore a staple of nearly 50% of the F1000.  The challenge has been to create a larger marketplace by moving the products into the mid-sized markets and really SAP doesn't resonate with them.  You can discount the products all you want but the cost of implementation and ongoing maintenance will still put you out of the running.
Advice: Figure out a long-term strategic vision or at least communicate it inward to your employees.  Realize that you cannot build relationships with new customers overnight and stop churning the accounts to try to find someone else to sell it.  The problem isn't the salespeople, it is the churn and the expectations.
Pros: I worked as an outside account executive for nearly two years at SAP.  The pro's are that there are a vast array of products to sell and there is great name recognition which helps to get you in the door.  Very solid benefits and a generally very supportive network environment.

Cons: Margin pressure as on-prem to cloud transition happens, causing the company to revert to old-line hyper-aggressive sales tactics and strategies.  This includes using audits to drive "artificial" revenue, and mid-year changes to sales comp plans that cause deductions to Sales AE earnings.  This, coupled with the huge complexity of getting things down within the company,  is affecting cutomer relationships, and causing acclerated flight of seasoned Account Executives, Sales Directors, and pre-sales teams who rely on building and maintaining trusted relationships with key accounts and long-time client or industry contacts.  Successfull sales leaders defecting to smaller industry players or to larger consutling partners and SI's.  Huge confusion still in R&D make or buy process. Great acquistions so far, and great vision with HANA, but needs serious rationalization.
Advice: Stick with the vision and resist short term P&L-driven decisions to appease Wall Street or to maximize internal personal MBO's or bonuses.  Reverse the slide and dis-investment in caring & feeding of top sales people.   Get R&D figured out.   No longer feasible to be either a German OR an American solution development culture.  Need to meld together to become a global dev culture, that has it own unique "SAP theme".  Oh, and have a chat with all of the CMO's.  SAP branding and marketing is balkanized and terrible.
Pros: Still a top rated enterprise software company. Competitive salaries for the most part. Large market presence globally, and huge customer base. Smart acquistions that gradually transition cusotmers from expensive on-premise SW to more innovative, cheaper cloud-based solutions. Fairly strong vision from dynamic CEO, and beginnings of stability with top "Managing Board" executives who report to the CEO.

Cons: Lots of "simplifications" recently.  That's the horrible euphemism going around now for layoffs.  "You've been simplified".  While I fully understand the needs to re-align business needs around our new product and delivery paradigm, I am concerned that as these layoffs have now stretched over multiple years that we are lowering morale, reducing commitment, and perhaps even the ability to deliver to our customers.  Everyone's running with their heads down.  Hopefully these changes stabilize soon so we can get back to being awesome for our customers.  (and hopefully I survive long enough to be part of that.)
Advice: In the effort to "run simple" everyone within the company is now running scared.  Please identify an end to these changes and let internal folks know.  People aren't collaborating now or doing anything to stand out.  It's hard to strive for excellence in the current climate.  We need to get back to functioning like the awesome team we once were.
Pros: Absolutely love this company!  Great people to work for, strong teams to work with.  You'll contribute a lot, but you'll learn a lot as well.  I'm completely committed to this company's success.  I'd love to make this the company I retire from, which brings me to the "cons" list:

Cons: Post-SAP acquisition, the company, as one would expect functioned more like a large, large, institutionalized corporation. Still plenty of talent and good people, but definitely a different outlook on work ethic, driving success, and making great things happen. SAP is going through its own internal struggle, trying to at once preserve its enterprise software business model, and adapt to the cloud. If you're applying to work at SAP in a location other than Silicon Valley, this is probably a great career choice for you, or if you want a 9-5er, it's probably a great career choice wherever you are. Everyone's different.
Advice: Embrace the cloud, run like a start-up.
Pros: Pre-SAP acquisition, great culture of hard working, smart, motivated, yet down-to-earth people. Lars has his own breed of culture, which is not for everyone, but in my opinion, is the best way to do business. Some core tenets: 1) No jerks 2) Take calculated risks, make mistakes, learn from them 3) Leave no man behind. If you have a chance to work for Lars, and want to be on a rocket ship, rather than a 9-5, take it. If you're looking for a steady, 9-5 job, there's certainly nothing wrong with that, everyone is different, but SuccessFactors was not that type of company.

Cons: I was with Sybase prior to the SAP acquisition.  This was the Sybase Corporate office and we were "the center of the universe" as far as the company was concerned.  SAP is headquartered in Germany so we are now on the very edge of the universe as far as the company is concerned and it was very difficult to get put on any meaningful projects.  The company is also going through a major change in that they're moving more to the cloud which means less IT staff is needed.  The combination of these two scenarios caused our entire 8 man team to be terminated after 14 or 15 ears of working at Sybase/SAP.
Advice: When SAP acquired Sybase we were told by upper SAP management that they did not acquire companies and terminate many employees  like Oracle does.  They did it any way.  Advice... get all of your skilled resources involved in meaningful work ASAP after acquisitions.
Pros: There are a lot of very talented people that work in the Dublin, CA office.  Pay is good and there is opportunity to learn different skills... HANA, Business Warehouse and front end tools in my case.

Cons: If compared to other campuses like Apple, VM Ware, the facilities seem old. Limited career  opportunities for young and old. Too much focus on cost savings. Volunteer matching program got removed. Long time employees are getting afraid of paying the bill for Germany's  employment protection laws. Still too much control from headquarter in Germany.
Advice: Allow to hire young people. Upgrade the campus in Palo Alto (all buildings, not only Deer Creek)Look at the new VM Ware campus across the street in Palo Alto with coffee shops etc. We still have middle managers who should not be there. Some long time very skilled employees get frustrated by hitting a glass ceiling both career and salary wise. Management should think of alternative benefits to attract young and old. For example: College assistant program (for newly grads to pay back the debt, for the older to save for their children). Additional options to save for retirement. Job rotation program for new college grads. Better dental insurance for the older employees.
Pros: Overall good work environment.  Flexible work hours. Great team spirit when in front of a customer. Great product, HANA is changing the industry.

Cons: Low pay. Doesn't match 401Ks. And after a while you realize management doesn't care about you  really, which became even more prevalent with the SAP acquisition. Nobody knows what's going on there after the purchase. Nobody knows if they're going to hire 300 more people, fire 300 using arbitrary rules that were instituted after the acquisition rather than give severance and down size, or really anything. I mean some people don't even know what their official title is anymore. Also there's this really passive aggressive war between Professional Services and Account Services, which just stifles collaboration and fixing the stuff that's wrong.
Advice: I dunno. Reevaluate your lives and decide if you want to be corporate bureaucrats for a giant German company who's CEO has a quote from Bono on the back of his ghost written biography? Or, like, treat people better? Maybe try not instituting rules, then dropping them, then adding new ones seemingly monthly? Maybe don't have managers passive aggressively fight over people who have been promoted or moved to a different department.
Pros: Free Drinks. Very casual. Promotes from within generally.

Cons: If you are an experienced consulting sales rep and considering a job with SAP Services, I give you this advice:  SAP Services is quickly turning into a SUPPORT group.  It's capabilities, service offerings and resources have been decimated to the point where you will just sell SUPPORT services.  (Ask about "One Service"  or about the number of consultants employed year over year during your interview and listen carefully to the answer.)  

Despite what they tell you, the job is NOT a true Sales role.  You'll mostly be a flunky of the license reps who will favor external partners.   Your management will be powerless to support you, but will hold you accountable for their failed strategies.    Most of them have never been front line sales people. Many of them are buddies from past jobs at other companies.

Key to Success: If you you are a shameless self-promoting sycophant, you'll do well here. Your main sale will be to promote yourself to clueless management who assign accounts based on how much you kiss up to them.  ACCOUNT ASSIGNMENT WILL MAKE OR BREAK YOU.  Last year (2014) approx  10% of the Services reps made their quotas.  Good Luck!
Advice: This would be a waste of time.
Pros: Great products and brand recognition.

Cons: Your experience will vary based on the department for which you work.  Some are very well managed and value employees, giving them freedom to implement new ideas while maintaining consistent goals and appropriate direction.  Others are very poorly managed, seemingly providing misdirection to their workers and making every task much more difficult then it need be.  

There is also the issue of internal politics.  Don't take on a management role unless you are ready to spend 95% of your time playing this game.
Advice: More entrepreneurial spirit, fewer road blocks.  Set annual goals at a more granular level so that employees know what is expected.  Develop real metrics for management staff so those that are hurting the organization can be identified, retrained or dismissed.
Pros: this large, global software company is a great place to learn.  Many internal groups offer everything from technical development positions through sales, marketing, consulting and training.  A global work force brings top talent from around the world together.  In any given day you can be talking with colleagues and customers from multiple countries.

Cons: To complex, to much infighting and not enough people actually care about anything other than themselves
clearly 2nd class to certain regional employee base
No clear path to upward mobility unless you befriend someone who has headcount
Too many fiefdoms which just create layers and complexity and don't drive much of anything
HR can move you at any time under new management or new role.
Too many baby boomers who are insecure about losing job or territory. Will play political games and push younger team members down
Not a market leader as it thinks and customer lock- in is changing
Advice: Stop finding all yes people and promote people based on merit not based on attrition and time served. If you want to find the best and brightest, then go to where they are not just rehash the same ex-employees who left for more money before.
Pros: A good play to settle down
decent money and perks 
many people on easy street so if you want to slow down this place is for you

Cons: Then SAP bought SF.... The fun and exciting culture was slowly replaced by management that didn't give .02 cents to what employees think and the sales teams were incentivized to fight each other for a sale. The compensation was lowered to the point where I couldn't afford to work there anymore and who would want to anyway because there was no training or incentives to excel. The managers who were promoted because they were good at sales had no management experience and had no idea how to lead or manage teams. I couldn't find the exit door fast enough! 
But this is what happens when a giant company buys the market leader and tries to cut operating costs and fit it under the umbrella of the parent. There might be as many as 5 people left from pre acquisition, but probably less...
Advice: Send your managers to training! Change the ways you incentivize so people can actually make money. Encourage your people to work in teams. Build a culture because there is none.
Pros: Pre acquisition the company was awesome. Lars was an inspirational leader and made some great kool aid! Compensation was great, culture was the best I've ever experienced and there was no negativity in the workplace.

Cons: Restructuring is a biannual event, or worse. Political coups and hijacking of projects are common occurrences. Products are created by engineering, then sold as something else by a perpetually disconnected sales and marketing army, and suddenly a solidly engineered technology needs to be hacked into whatever it got positioned as for customers.

HR in the US has been completely outsourced to offshore call centers, and things like compensation for paid leave, reimbursement for expenses, and help with problems with the health insurance provider can take months to resolve.
Advice: #1 Priority - Hire a real human resources department, with on-site reps available to employees in all major locations. Fire whoever came up with the idea of outsourcing HR.
Pros: A surprisingly large number of very intelligent engineers, some very interesting technologies, and a fair amount of freedom and flexibility. Palo Alto campus is very pleasant, with open spaces, decent cafeterias, a nice little garden... there is a fitness center, but it's a bit inadequate.

Cons: Low performance requirements. Even though there is training available, not a lot of people actually have the time to use it. Most people bogged down with bug fixing and test management listening to the HANA, HANA, HANA propaganda rather than exploring and implementing computer science papers. There is not a lot of visible growth opportunities for the young people that come into former Sybase. Indeed most of the people are here for decades doing the same or almost the same thing.
Advice: Give more time to develop new features and hacking the products, which eventually will lead to the desired by the management innovation. Reserve time for training programs for each development employee. Really eliminate the QA position and not only on words and paper and make former QA program. People do need to be technically competitive on the job market. Pay more attention to what the young people want from their careers.
Pros: Gym and classes, subsidized food, Big company benefits. Possibility to grow if you are transferring from Germany.

Cons: - SAP does not pay competitively
- SAP does not do a good job of adjusting pay across countries or states. 
- Often your sphere of influence on a given "important project" is limited by managers inserting themselves who are not necessarily understanding all the complexities of the project but are making decisions anyway based on some political factor
- Not all teams do the performance appraisals correctly so you can get places in a team that does not do performance appraisals properly and then it doesn't matter how good your work is
Advice: If the cons in the above section are fixed then I think that SAP would be a much better place to work.
Pros: - Work/Life balance is great, SAP is very understanding about family commitments and very supportive of each other 
- You often have the opportunity to work on significant projects
- There is a performance based pay type of culture so if you are good in your job you can get paid, depending on Department

Cons: SAP Global Marketing is a division of a over-complex structure, the giant German software company SAP. Its headquarters in New York but has ramifications in Germany and in a lot of other places. As in any big multicultural company the main issue is Politics.
Advice: The top management has a tendency to recruit only senior employees who are done fighting for a better position. The good point is that there is a lot of very smart and talented marketers, however the company is aging and should consider keeping more interns on the payroll and open to younger generations.
Pros: In New York especially the quality of the work space is outstanding, you also get a great flexibility, get to meet worldwide stakeholders, have exciting business challenges... and most of the time you get to define your own KPIs!

Cons: - work-life balance can be tough, especially in global roles where you have interact with time zones
- even though company is growing, it is still cutting back in certain areas -- if you don't get cut, you typically have to pick up the slack which can feel unmanageable at times
Advice: - when executing a reduction in force, clearly communicate the expectations of those left standing as to how to manage existing workloads and make sure those are realistic -- especially considering morale is already down with friends being forced to leave
Pros: - great pay and benefits
- exciting vision for the future of technology
- rewarded for contribution as well as potential for contribution
- good training offerings for SAP certifications as well as education allowance
- laid back culture of autonomy and self scheduling -- just get things done and add value

Cons: 1. Very poor internal communication strategy.  People get promoted, change departments, or get fired and you almost never hear about it from management and when you do its way too late - everyone already knows about it through the rumor mill.  This is leading to a growing lack of confidence in management, especially in the face of the company being bought out.

2. Fast-paced growth and acquisition by a giant software mega-corp is changing the feel of the company overall - despite insistence from upper management to the contrary.  It's not all bad - but it's different and in combination with number 1 lends itself to a sense of unease amongst employees.  Tech start ups don't stay start ups forever if they are doing it right, so these changes are to be expected.
Advice: Please put some serious focus on internal communication and employee development (automated internet security trainings do not count).  The company is at a critical junction and if you want to continue developing dedicated and passionate employees you need to treat them as valued resources.  Start sending monthly department updates/news or something - anything to make us feel in the loop.  There is a growing concern over becoming "just a number" at SAP - and that's not a feeling you want employees to have.
Pros: Been here almost 5 years and it's been an amazing experience overall.  Good place to develop a career, not just to work.  I got in at the right time and have benefitted from company growth from ~150 employees at time of hire to over 400 today (maybe close to 500).

1. In my experience the people are great, and over the course of my tenure I've always been happy with my immediate management despite several changes/promotions.  I've dealt with very little micro-management, and I've always felt able to approach my manager with concerns or to ask for advice.

2. Ability to move up quickly if you display intelligence, a good work ethic, sense of personal responsibility, and make smart/strategic decisions.  It's the business world - you have to be able to play the game at least a little bit.

3. Great company culture - casual office environment, higher level management is generally approachable, beer carts, and historically there have been a lot of company social events.  However that culture feels endangered due to acquisition by SAP (see cons).

Cons: One of the main issue with such a large company is that you are used at 20% of your capacity. Some people are fine with this but at the end of the day, I felt unused and I could contribute even more. 
Another issue is that you work on a project for several months and all of a sudden, without notice, the project is stopped and you are dispatched to another team, without any chance to decide wheter or not this is good or bad.
Advice: The top management is only dedicated to manage their own carrer rather than the group they are working for. Too much politics here. And globally, you will find much more managers than leaders...
Pros: Overall, overtime, it offers a nice compensation package, and the people I used to work with were very nice and knowledgable.

Cons: As with any large corporation there tends to be a lot of churn in middle management and this can make it difficult to keep a clear strategy and momentum over the longer term.  There has been less of a focus on strong leadership for many years but this is improving.  Many people in management positions with strong technical but poor management/leadership skills.
Advice: None
Pros: Major culture shift the last 7 years.  Leadership is making great strides to keep  us relevant and innovating.  They have done this under heavy competitive pressure and some key leadership changes the last few years. Company wide people are great to work with, benefits and pay are great.  Opportunity to work with many people all over the world which can be a challenge but we make it work well because of the people and culture.

Cons: - very complex, takes a long time to 'see the light' and understand the complexity of solutions and how they interact, integrate and with a constant stream of new acquisitions it will keep one busy
- several reorganizations and changes in middle management 
- not too well known (yet) outside of Europe
- huge 'tail' of old perceptions, slow, mammoth and inflexible contrasts with new drive to innovate and change business for the better
Advice: simplify even more...market, advertise, move away from technical jargon and drop the huge tail that seemingly keeps SAP from moving as fast as it desires
Pros: - Global company, one of world's leading technology/business solution providers, great drive to innovate and change the business paradigm.
- many travel opportunities 
- well known in some industries, less in others
- HANA is seemingly the best in-memory database in existence today, huge opportunity

Cons: Each group/department/project seems to be run in isolation.  There is very little collaboration across the organization.  The culture is nepotistic. A good number of managers should not be managers and treat their underlings as either an entourage or player trading cards that they collect for the sake of maintaining appearances.
Advice: Don't just dole out assignments and projects, assign them appropriately based on your teams skills regardless of what title they may hold. Work to help tear down silos across the organization and try to actively keep your team engaged on projects with other teams.  Don't just delegate, execute!
Pros: Warm people work here who have the potential to be good friends.  Lots of activities on campus to both help you network and gain new skills. The facilities are awesome and include a gym and free lunch.

Cons: Promotions are difficult to obtain probably due to the recent acquisitions, making the organization top heavy. Other cons are work-life balance from the organization challenges of being in multiple countries. Most of the colleagues we interact with are in the corporate HQ location in Germany so there are many early morning calls needed.
Advice: Even though the company touts career growth, the reality is that upward mobility is very rare. Work-life balance is also out of control as a result of recent reorgs.
Pros: The salary at SAP is on the higher side for technology companies. Bonuses are fairly consistent however they tend to be a larger percentage of overall compensation, more so than most would want. Other pluses are things like employee stock purchase plans, good insurance, many employee discounts at companies SAP does business with and a flexible work environment.

Cons: Too big of a company to make immediate decisions or get customer service issues handled in a timely matter.  Sales process is completely micromanaged and you will have to update upper management 3x a week on the same information. Managers are not upfront about actual comp made within verticals and territories .  Takes years to get a pipeline and by then they will have already changed your territory or vertical or job description.
Advice: Be upfront about true comp and actual OTE earnings.  Stand up to upper management about changes and getting your employees credit for deals they work on or originate.
Pros: Free Lunch, Great benefits, Travel stipend, 3000 products to sell, salary + ote when you reach Large Enterprise sales

Cons: - Sales environment is tuff but rewarding
- Can be bureaucratic and political but what large company isn't.
Advice: - Put more focus on customers than on sales, profit and the current quarter
- Need to decide if you want to be in services business or not.  If so, do what it takes to be a great services organization, not just a high margin one.
- The amount of leadership change on the services side is baffling. Pick some winners and stick with them. 
- Do more around leadership development and succession planning.
Pros: - Company continues to strive and invest to be at forefront of business and IT, SAP is an exciting place to work.
- Great benefits, people, and pay
- Lots of smart people to work with and opportunities abound
- Mature processes, management and capabilities

Cons: Pay is relatively less compared to the market and they don't have great benefits in terms on bonus and company shares.
Advice: Pay the employee what they deserve and promote based on merit and not the number of years spent in the company
Pros: There's a new project to work on every three months, so things move at a fast pace. Good in a way because you don't tend to get bored working on the same thing. And there's always lots to learn. People in general are nice to work with and the company has reasonably flexible hours. You are allowed to work from home occasionally and there's no dress code. Situated in Reston just minutes away from Wiehle station and very close to the future metro stop. The company has a lot going for it.

Cons: As of right now SAP is laying off most of their North American (US based) CTC employees in favor of cheaper less experienced Cloud Consultants in India.  They can hire 10 employees in India to 1 in North America.
Advice: Focus on quality, not quantity as your customer base demands it..  If not, in the long run you will be last in the cloud as customers see they cannot understand the other guy on the end of the phone (because of their thick Indian accent) and barely have enough experience to do the most simple task unless it's spelled out for them in a guide. If you have a large problem it will take forever to get resolved because you've laid off your most experienced American employees.
Pros: Learn a lot supporting multiple SAP products in the cloud.  Good networking and training opportunities. If you love to travel this is where you want to be in consulting.

Cons: Internal systems are really slow and cumbersome. There are a lot of people who seem to do nothing and still work there forever. Very sexist culture. If you are a woman, be prepared to be treated like a second class citizen
Advice: Take a careful look at HR. Women are not taken seriously. I tried to fire a man who harassed one  of my female sales reps but no one took me seriously because I was a new manager, even though  I have 15 years of experience.
Pros: Great benefits, training. Free lunch with healthy food. The quotas are completely out of touch with reality of the pipeline. People take credit for deals they they didn't have anything to do anything with.

Cons: - If you want to grow in the company you better say yes to moving (not sure if this is a con but it could also be a pro)
- People who exceed in performance may get better benefits (this is true with all companies)
- If you think you exceed in performance and if it does not match their calculation and matrix, do not expect much at the end of the year (raises and others)
Advice: None
Pros: - Great benefit and atmosphere
- Lots of path to take for your career
- Acknowledging and guiding professional growth (In short it is part of their process to ask you what do you want to do and they will help you get there)
- For high caliber individuals, more room to mold your career

Cons: Inconsistency on budget distribution across the company results in some areas to burn money without having to show real benefits to the Company while some other are begging funding to develop customer needs
Multi-fragmentation on software roadmap and maintenance.
Some teams are supporting markets with no timezone overlap to engage with customers
Slow decision making process especially at middle management
Rework and reinvention of the wheel from bad Management decisions.
Too non-technical people deciding or managing technical projects or decisions.
Advice: Bring knowledgeable and experience people to challenge and enrich your strategic and executive decisions.
Engagement
Pros: Board vision and strategy, passion of its employees for the Company and its products, SAP technology and products, good salary and benefits, encouragement for education and training, important knowledge base, home office,

Cons: There was a huge culture clash between SAP and SuccessFactors.  SAP bought us, so they had the right to operate as they saw fit.  Unfortunately all A+ players left the company.  Comp plans ultimately changed by SAP which was a big driver in the exodus.
Advice: Trust in the SuccessFactors team to do what they know best.  Do not interfere with how to sell a SaaS solution and don't get it twisted up in legacy, outdated, old-school perpetual license deals.
Pros: Was at SuccessFactors in the early days through 2015 and truly enjoyed it.  Management team responsible for growth was outstanding.  A life changing experience for sure.

Cons: Decisions makers live in Germany. Culture is conservative. While they have a big connection to the Silicon Valley with their recent acquisitions (Sybase, Ariba, SucessFactors, ConCur) and SAP corporate site in Palo Alto, the home office in Germany still dictates how things get done. They may leave you alone and look for your input, but the final decision rests with someone in a different country. Limited advancement and always in cost-cutting mode (who isn't!). No travel, but then people are traveling all the time. Not much in terms of employee investment.
Advice: None
Pros: People are really nice. Everybody is very professional and all want to do a good job.

Cons: Since the acquisition by SAP, we have lost some of the entrepreneurial spirit. We are trying to regain the cloud mentality, but it takes a while to move 70,000 SAP people into the mentality of the 2,000 SuccessFactors people. Though, I am glad to notice that management from the very top recognize this and are still trying to get there.
Advice: Continue with the pursuit of the cloud mentality.
Pros: SuccessFactors has always been a wonderful company in which to work. The spirit of the cloud is pervasive. Being an international company, there are opportunities to work with people across the globe and even opportunities to stay within the company and move to another country. Since being acquired by SAP, those opportunities have even grown more.

Cons: Processes. The company is run like a German made machine. There are processes to follow to get things done. The processes are not always simple.

Slow promotion. This is especially true for Canada.
Advice: The management has done a great job remaking this otherwise static company in recent years. There are a lot of resources inside the company. It is important to encourage people to leverage on these resources to acquire new skills and develop new ideas.
Pros: Good work life balance. Decent pay. Good benefits. Company name looks good on resume and LinkedIn. The company has a lot of resources and opportunities to explore.

Considering the sheer size of the company, I must give credits to the management on how efficient the company is run.

The colleagues are helpful and professional.

Cons: The main disadvantage is work life balance. While management tries to promote a healthier WLB there are situations where I need to sacrifice personal time to resolve critical issues of travel unexpectedly to manage customer situations.
Advice: Continue to push your employees to be better people and more successful.
Pros: I thoroughly enjoy working for SAP. I feel challenged by my work which keeps me interested and engaged which I feel is important in the field of engineering. Most importantly I feel that the management team wants me to succeed and many go out of their way to help me.

Compensation is fair and SAP provides plenty amenities (subsidised meals/free gym facilities etc) which make going to the office more enjoyable.

Cons: Change and reorganizations occur often.  Colleagues change roles often (many times for the better, such as promotions), as well as territories and account coverage.
Advice: Just try to focus on making minimal organizational change from year-to-year, particularly as it relates to sales coverage (geographical territories; product bag, etc.).  I'm sure you've lost many talented people because of adjusting sales territories too often.
Pros: An above average compensation package is possible for sales roles.  Also, getting exposure to many bright and talented people through both SAP and it's partners can open up future opportunities that may not be as available with many other companies.

Cons: Very political, conservative. You need to learn to build network of your own. Career advancement is solely dependent on who you know not the talent. Lot of executives children in the millenial jobs and management favors them vs experienced professionals. Don't be surprised if some millenial nut job tries to manage you.
Advice: Get your heads out of the cloud. Focus on building solutions not just vaporware that vanishes in 12months
Pros: Good company, great customers and opportunity to make a difference for businesses.

Cons: problematic senior management team. Not capable. HR only care for manage-up, not caring for the one who is working. If you do not have a green card don't come! Be very careful if you are on H1. They would try to exhaust your H1 and decide if they would apply green card for you.
Advice: You have lots of good and capable people. Be more aggressive to do more with the team in Palo Alto. They are BORED! Don't be so scare of making mistakes for goodness sake! You are in the Valley, not in the middle of cornfield! Look at your parking lot! and compare that to other companies!!
Pros: Good work life balance, all kinds of products line.

Cons: SAP has the paperwork and bureaucracy found in many large companies.  For example, when I worked at a small company, I could use flex time to visit my dentist during a 2-hour lunch, so long as I still worked at least 8 hours that day.  At SAP I could not do this, instead I needed to take an entire sick or vacation day to complete my 1-hour dentist visit.
Advice: Encourage transparency - I did not see any link between my performance and compensation.  Listen - several of my coworkers felt they had no voice at SAP, so they literally spent off-hours selling soap for Amway, in order to gain some control over their compensation.
Pros: SAP provides a generous benefit package following the model of many European headquartered companies.  I received 4 weeks of vacation and free all-you-can-eat lunches.

Cons: Demotivated managers - most of them -Germans - are in their position only because of their passport. They are either playing in the stock market or busy with real estate investments in emerging markets. No intention to inspire employees..
Advice: Perform or perish. Show some interest in employees career. Senior employees are replaced in the name of hiring early talent. That is fine in one way, but do train them adequately.
Pros: Great work life balance. Access to plenty of study materials on any technology, free lunch, employee centric, flexible hours are some of the advantages.

Cons: Recently acquired by SAP there's some uncertainty about what this means to the fieldglass culture long-term. While they do offer a paid vacations benefit their vacation plan is not as competitive as other companies.
Advice: Continue to work closely with your direct reports to continue to foster the positive fieldglass environment.
Pros: Finally, a company who understands project management and has both the foundation and best practices in place to allow their Project Managers to thrive.  Competitive salary, positive, optimistic professional  environment.  They do a lot of the little things to let their employees know they care.

Cons: Management is incredibly buzzword oriented.  Huge earthshaking management decisions that really don't affect anyone for long so if you ignore them they go away.
Advice: Stop trying to make your employees into CEOs.  It's great that you want to sit me down all the time and tell me all about the nitty gritty of high-level marketing and sales data and decision making, but I'm a tech.  Try focussing your propaganda on things that actually affect me, instead of alienating me by never talking about anything except things that are completely outside my scope of work.
Pros: Lots of options available because of the huge size of the company.

Cons: Silos, Silos, Silos.   The multitude of global teams you engage with to complete customer requests are not interested in knowing any overarching process since they serve a multitude of internal customers.  As a result, handing over downstream tasks to another team cannot be assured unless micromanaged. Keeping this job's role witihn business hours is difficult if not improbable if you care to ensure customer success.
Advice: None
Pros: Can easily work virtually or on site, your preference.  Hands off managing since most everyone in this role is self sufficient and has proven customer management history.  You own your customer relationships fully and management is only involved in escalations.

Cons: You may get stuck on a long term engagement that can derail your professional development.  Some of the technology is stuck in the past.  Most training has to be done on your own time.
Advice: Management could show a commitment to training and development by allowing consultants to take some time away from client sites, to take training courses.  It will ensure the quality of the consulting force for the longer term.
Pros: Interesting technologies on some of the newer projects.  Colleagues are very intelligent, and willing to share and exchange knowledge.  Good compensation for consultants, and decent benefits.

Cons: Maintaining work/life balance can be a challenge - in some areas of the company, you must be willing to travel extensively (which can be a pro or a con depending on your personal preferences).   

It's important that you build your internal networks to take full advantage of career and training opportunities.
Advice: Balance market growth with employee engagement and retention.
Pros: SAP is a firm with brand recognition, global reach and a very diverse employee base.   Because of this, there exist many opportunities for career growth with extensive training, multiple managerial, operational or technical tracks and solid compensation and benefits.

Cons: - Run by Executive Board that generally disagrees on everything or seems to actively avoid making decisions
- A select few -- very few -- employees are given the lion's share of new and exciting opportunities
- Horrible at promoting women and initiatives to improve the representation of women have token executive support
- Everything is done by committee, so anything delivered is watered down and not compelling
- Most people spend their day in endless meetings to "align" with several other groups doing essentially the same thing
- Many people will join your committee to work on a cool project, but only 5% of them will actually do any work
- Works Council in Germany -- essentially a union -- advocates for German employees and has approval authority over promotions, re-orgs, etc.  Employees in other countries have no such leverage
- American employees will work long hours, European employees generally will not take a meeting after 4p in their timezone and think nothing of asking the Americans to attend meetings at 5a or 6a in the US
- Management will bicker over spending $50K on something while wasting Millions on projects that are going no where
- Love/hate relationship with Silicon Valley
- Will hire you to do a job that you soon discover is actually already done by 3-4 other people in the org
- Employees -- even relatively senior managers -- have very little decision-making authority and are actively discouraged from making decisions
Advice: - Motivated, high-value employees usually feel that management actively prevents their success
- Get serious about hiring and keeping strong women in leadership
Pros: - Willing to invest in exploration of new business trends
- Can work there for life if you don't mind never advancing
- Pay is relatively high compared to market, mostly because they don't do anything significant with stock/equity

Cons: So many re-orgs -- it means you have to prove yourself to new execs constantly and often the work you put in for the last exec is meaningless to the new one.

Inconsistency in resources across regions means people are stretched thin and burning out -- causes animosity
Advice: Stop playing musical chairs -- spend and find good leaders and get your marketing department stable.  Centralize resources so smaller markets can benefit.
Pros: Challenging - no 'assembly line'-like feeling.  New challenges offering you the opportunity to be creative, innovative and prove your worth to colleagues and leaders.  If this is what drives you, you'll do well at SAP.

Cons: Easy to get stuck in a rut (with a product that doesn't generate revenue).
Periodic layoffs with no clear explanation on how positions eliminated were picked -- supposedly, the position and not the person, so many exceptional employees can be surprised to find they have a month to look internally, or find better opportunities elsewhere
Advice: It's tough to be engaged when seemingly random layoffs happen (to excellent employees).
Instead of worrying about the competition, focus on delighting existing customers.or they'll have cause to talk to the competition.
Pros: Free lunches at multiple cafeterias
Good bonuses
Nice location (near VMware, Pivotal, and Tesla)
Some projects use latest technologies

Cons: Feels like a dead end for engineers. Below average total packages compared to most companies in the area. It feels like I work for a poor company that is doing bad and has no money. The company will have a difficult time to attract quality talent, keep existing talent, and build great things unless they spend money on its employees. SAP seems to have less interest in SuccessFactors future.
Advice: Don't make engineering your low priority. Strong talent can really change the company's future.
Pros: Parent company SAP is big and it gives stability to SuccessFactors business. Some good colleagues. Open communication by management to all employees.

Cons: - Bureaucratic setup that does not get much work done and too many middle manager who have no clue about software development.
- Very many bad projects and failures brushed aside by smart marketing & sales teams. But not quite sure how long this will continue before things comes out.
- Uninspiring leadership from management in running customer engagements. 
- Glory days are over and not a good place for software developers as there are not much imaginative work happening here.
Advice: Need to trim middle management, eliminate bureaucracy and rejuvenate development community before its too late.
Pros: + Few great individuals still left in this company although mostly in Germany.
+ Tons of material to all you want about SAP products and solutions.
+ Great company for sales jobs and have some really smart sales leaders all the way to the top.

Cons: Can be a very bureaucratic and process-bound place, and a tendency to be quite conservative in terms of go to market and product strategy.
Advice: There are some incredibly bright people here, and a brand name that commands respect in Silicon Valley, but at the same time SAP has a reputation for being overly cautious and conservative.  This perception needs to change in order for the company to compete for talent with other Valley corporate giants that don't have this perception.
Pros: Lots of innovative, bright people to work with, a very low key corporate culture, and nice campus amenities in Palo Alto.

Cons: Speed and agility - This is definitely an area SAP can improve on. 
I have often felt that SAP leadership lacks decisiveness. So, in several areas you see similar products competing with other SAP products, and it could be confusing. This often affects the speed of delivery. 
There is also more resistance to change, so you could get stuck with "dead" products or technologies for a while.
Proprietary technologies - SAP's flagship products - SAP Business Suite - is built using proprietary technologies. In the last few years, SAP has embraced more common technology stacks to build solutions, and I hope this will only increase and will improve the ease of development and speed of delivery. 
Not enough early talent - I feel that the average age of an SAP employee is higher than the industry average. This is a huge benefit due the experience and knowledge levels that reflect in high quality of software products the company produces. But, it is important to balance this with early talent to leverage new ideas, trends, skills and energy they can bring.
Advice: Please focus more on perks and benefits to improve employee engagement and satisfaction. Small gifts, perks, spot awards and similar benefits can improve employee satisfaction tremendously. In dynamic job markets like Silicon Valley or Bangalore, this can play an important role in retaining talent, and even attracting new and young talent.
Pros: I have been with SAP for over 12 years. That it itself is a testament to how valued and comfortable the company makes you feel as an employee. 
With SAP, you get the feeling that you are working on high value products that make a material impact to how businesses are run. The brand is highly respected in the industry. Work culture is great, very open and employee friendly. Pay and benefits are okay, it is better than average market, but the upside is limited as there is no profit sharing or RSUs granted on a regular basis. 
The best part is, SAP provides great opportunities to move within the company to new jobs and teams, and invests in talent development.

Cons: Often times designated resources (engineers) aren't available for high priority items - as a Support Account Manager, you may be asked to look at code of forms, etc. to help move things along.
Advice: Invest more in getting back end processes aligned so front-end managers are not left in the cold!
Pros: Great pay - lots of investment in new products, both internally (CRM system) and in developing the different modules (new reports, new views, etc.) Lots of good energy and flexibility to work remotely.

Cons: Huge organization, 75K+ employees means sometimes not as agile in decision making process, I have had a couple of experiences where new compensation plans have not been rolled out until well into the 2nd quarter, which causes frustration on the part of the sales team.  Also there can be a bit of a "revolving door" in middle management as they work to get experience to climb the corporate ladder, causing some instability.
Advice: great job making the customer's experience top priority now try making the SAP colleagues experience top of mind.
Pros: Great company, forward thinking, solid management team.

Cons: Large company can at times seem very fragmented (or even completely in a Silo).  Must take your own initiative to learning and advancing - no one will promote you just for putting in your time (I think that's actually a "pro" :-))
Advice: Break down the silo mentality.  When new companies are added to the family, do more to proactively integrate them, and inform the family of the new "child"
Pros: Great compensation, benefits and work-life balance.  Good Training is available, pretty unlimited advancement opportunities.  Lots of work-from home jobs as well.

Cons: still a lot of legacy code that can be difficult to maintain. Sometimes the smaller offices do not abide by a few of the more generous policies the parent company has in place. sometimes the operations team in the datacenters is not very responsive, making it difficult to resolve live customer issues.
Advice: continue the push to the cloud, give the developers better access to the operations team in the data centers to help resolve issues more quickly.
Pros: Changing technologies, dedication to continuing education through company class offerings and external resources, stable established company with an eye towards the future.

Cons: A lot of where you can go depends on who you know.  Highly matrixed organizational structure means you need to learn how decisions are made and where people are that can help you.  Silos exist based on management objective bonus structure, which doesn't always lead to the "best" decision for the business.
Advice: Improve decision making at lower level by tying more to corporate objectives versus silo objectives.
Pros: Strong business, financially sound, with great career opportunities for growth.  Multinational with many markets/industries/solutions.  Excellent "high potential" program to nurture top talent.

Cons: It is a large company, that works with other large organizations so there will be complexity.
Needs a little more marketing to let other companies know we are more than just ERP.
Advice: Keep caring about the employees, the rest will fall into place.
Pros: One of the smartest group of people I've ever worked with.
SAP really does care about myself as an employee and where I'd like for my career to go.
They are re-inventing themselves so they can help companies run better for years to come.
Decent work / life balance.
Compensation is above average for my field

Cons: Since ERP makes a lot of money, all other team only try to make fancy products without generating revenue.  A lot of recent managers are pushing to release products not for generating money from customer but getting credit for promotion.
Advice: Hire smart, diligent people with high compensation instead of hiring more mediocre people with cheap salary.  Check manager's performance is not based on how fast the product is released but how good the product is.
Pros: Stable enterprise business oriented. Long vacation package. Fair health and 401K benefit. With $6.5 lunch credit and free fruit daily.

Cons: Deal with inefficiency, bureaucracy, people that wants to retire and not bringing new ideas or support. Due to the transition to the cloud prepare to deal with people that take credits for your ideas
Advice: Create a more inclusive multi-generation environment, avoiding impact on talent people during the transition to the cloud, invest on the new leaders and people that manage teams.
Pros: Work and collaborate with talent, innovative people globally. Be aware of the trends that are happening, participate on Interesting projects that are impacting the trends in the market.

Cons: Because it is such a large company, there are smaller groups that are lost in the shuffle because they are only a blip on the radar. As such resourcing and budgeting can be a big challenge.
Advice: The people matter and are what makes the company a good company. Without the people supporting processes, developing, and selling, the best product in the world will mean nothing.
Pros: Very good overall company. The executive board has a good plan and are executing against that plan. Benefits are good and compensation seems to be competitive with the local markets.

Cons: SAP is still trying to change itself into the Cloud Company powered by SAP HANA. As much as we'd like to be, were not a start up - by default, as we have more than 70k employees. Some older folks are still stuck in the "old way of doing things"
Advice: Embrace change. Focus on millennials. Be a champion for your employee's success. Support the people below you. Doing all these would be a recipe for success.
Pros: SAP is great company. Strong Vision with a compelling story to tell our customers. Hard-working, humble employees all around. Highly Recommend

Cons: The suite of offerings (both software and services) is very complex and seems to be in a constant state of change.  This makes it very difficult for a single individual to explain things to customers, and as a result, the account team becomes a small army of resources - each one specialized in one small niche of the overall solution.  Ask 10 different resources to define something as heavily marketed as HANA, and you are likely to get a good 7 or 8 entirely different responses.  

I'm always surprised when I read other people listing work/life balance as one of the "pros" of working at SAP.  I worked weekends and vacations just to keep up because of either unrealistic expectations or dealing with the added time required to work through the red tape that is required to do one's job.  Every vacation request was challenged by my manager even though I had earned the time off, and I painfully recollect times when I was staring out at the ocean from my hotel room while I was on a mandatory conference call.

Maybe it was just the team that I was on, but I found management to be aloof and clique-ish.  A lot of management by intimidation, and then those same managers wonder why you don't reach out to them more often.  The reality is that they (the managers) are under constant pressure and it all flows downstream.
Advice: Simplify the offerings, services and strategy so that people have a simple and concise story to tell their customers.  Be more approachable and mingle with your entire team as opposed to the 2-3 people that you clearly like more than everyone else.
Pros: ERP software still best in class; development comes up with some very innovative / solid solutions; great opportunity to work with highly intelligent and driven people

Cons: Large bureaucratic organization that is highly resistant to change despite increasing competitive pressures and cracks in customer loyalty (lock-in) SAP has relied on for decades.
Advice: Spend more time focusing externally on market dynamics and customer needs rather than bolstering traditional products and antiquated sales and product innovation operating models.
Pros: A leading brand in the tech industry with broad and truly global reach. Large installed base that has become dependent upon SAP for most of its infrastructure. Some savvy acquisitions in recent years give the company the potential to pivot to regain its fast-waning leadership in the tech space.

Cons: Global Management decisions have been affecting the moral and quality of work by moving jobs overseas and eliminating jobs in the USA.  Their mindset is "cost savings" and "run simple".  The past 4 years has been hit the hardest with layoffs across all areas of the company.  
This is the biggest disappointment for someone like me who has been committed for 9 years and was recently notified their job was eliminated.
Advice: None
Pros: some areas of the business are flexible as they offer virtual opportunities

Cons: Overly process oriented, and the processes are very difficult to follow.  Rules for everything and not flexible.  Even even the rules are killing your business they do not provide middle (or in many cases upper) management the ability to fix things.
Advice: Empower middle management to make decisions.  Make processes much easier to follow.  The processes are crippling, and the amount of money spent just to cut through red tape is so expensive it is ridiculous.
Pros: They provide good pay and have excellent benefits. They provide opportunities for training to keep you up on latest technologies.

Cons: Throw you under the bus mentality. Encourage you to always ask questions and seek help yet no one is available to help. They throw you in front of clients and hope you stay afloat.
Advice: Clearly define role in interview process. So much focus was on relationship management with clients while technical strengths were downplayed. Teams are way too busy to appropriately train new hires.
Pros: Good people, profitable organization, good technology

Cons: Travel can be extensive, if you enjoying seeing new places you will enjoy it, just know sometimes your client can be in the middle of no where. Like any company, reorgs happen to often.
Advice: It's understandable that they would want 1 Global unit, but at the cost of all the reorgs I am not sure its completely worth it. Keep rewarding your consultants with compensation, that's what they want
Pros: Great company
The consultants you work with are the best in their fields
Good pay and flexibility
Opportunity to travel and see places you otherwise might not of have.

Cons: Revolving door in sales at all levels. There are a select few with strong patches, but most people just have territories where it is going to be really difficult for anyone to hit their number. Many are not even close.... HCM is not a strategic priority of SAP. It is a soft spot, like CRM. HANA is the priority.
Advice: None
Pros: Base salary is solid, OTE is great (if you can hit your target). From what I hear, it was a pretty great place to work prior to the SAP acquisition.

Cons: Working long hours during month ends
Advice: None
Pros: Great people. Great environment. Its a great company to add to your resume. Everywhere you go, employees are looking for those who have background in SAP. So working there was definitely a plus. People are very welcoming and friendly and are always there to support and assist each others. I worked as a contractor but I would consider this to be my first career or job after graduation. Having SAP has definitely open up many great career opportunities for me and it still does!

Cons: SAP culture and politics encroaching fast.  Some product lines are falling behind the curves and performance can suffer. Not as innovative as they were 5 years ago.
Advice: Try your best to hold onto Lars' original core value and not get overrun by big SAP politics.  Focus on your employees and they will stay motivated to move you forward.
Pros: Company motto is "no jerks", and it's true.  The folks there are genuine and have excellent core values. Hopefully they won't lose this after the SAP acquisition.

Cons: Germany based company whose German employees generally resent non-European colleagues as they feel they get favored treatment (which is not true).
Advice: For a company that says it rarely lays off employees, employees get laid off on a regular basis without any apparent rhyme or reason. Would be nice to allow employees whose jobs are "redundant" to get training to move into "growth" areas of the company.
Pros: I enjoyed working for SAP - they have great training, try to offer a work-life balance and fantastic benefits.

Cons: Very bureaucratic and for the sales people, the internal processes can take 80%+ of your time while actual customer facing time is less than optimal.  There are many redundancies and not explanation as to why something is being forced down from "the powers that be"
Advice: If we want to teach our customers to "run Simple with SAP" we need to learn how to do it internally.  Stop adding so many layers of sales and the need for redundant communications, updates, meetings, calls and processes.
Pros: Great technology and focus on innovation

Cons: Plan to work your rear end off
Very demanding
Like most places, if you are not in the right role you are not likely to succeed
Way too many complex internal processes. 
Too internal facing which kills productivity
Advice: Good strategy.  Go boldly as fast as you can.
Pros: Great opportunities in the right places
Very complete solution set
High quality software and services 
Way ahead of most competitors 
Ability to really make a difference in the fortunes of your customers. 
Mostly possitive, team based environment 
All the work can pay off

Cons: As a large organization, there are many levels of approvals and processes, so innovation is slow. Compensation is below average in the high-cost regions, and it is hard to attract fresh talent.
Advice: None
Pros: Very large company that develops software for just about any solution, so many opportunities for employees to expand knowledge and skills into different areas if they have the necessary transferable skills. Work-life balance is highly regarded so work hours can be very flexible.

Cons: The challenges of being a contract employee is that you work for a staffing company instead of directly for SAP. Therefore you have less access to all that is available to permanent employees.
Advice: Keep being Innovative to drive the success of Simple solutions at SAP
Pros: Working as a contractor you get to learn from the professionals and work with a vast array of various
personalities and diverse co-workers and executives.

Cons: Not as agile to change organizations given large workers council controlled workforce
Can't cut costs and redirect investments as fast as smaller non-european based companies
Think they can do everything themselves
Advice: Need to find a way to reduce costs in Germany because it weighs down the company - makes us less agile

Less reorgs - people are just "waiting and seeing" and are less action oriented
Pros: Diverse global culture across all functions
In a high tech market sweetspot
Very aggressive pushing new technologies for being such a large company

Cons: A lot of positions are very specialized.  In my last company (which was much smaller), most everybody did a little bit of everything.  At SAP, everyone does exactly their job, and nothing else.  I find that a little boring and limiting.
Advice: Don't demand so much uniformity.  For example, Agile / scrum development doesn't make sense for every group.
Pros: It's a big company, so if you want to move to a different location or change groups, there are lots to choose from.

Cons: Heavy political atmosphere pervades in the sales organization. This. coupled with a matrix organization. impacts everything from account assignments, employment reviews and opportunity pursuits.
Advice: From a product perspective, be more agile in product development. Sales management needs to better understand sales objections and interaction between Consulting, Account Management, and Solution Executives to increase efficiency in sales pursuits
Pros: Great brand name recognition,, talented and smart people. Sales management very professional and empowers the team to make independent decisions

Cons: Typical to any large company top down decisions can be made which affects daily work environment.  Polital scene can be a difficult to navigate.
Advice: Make sure that focus is on the customer, at a high level the strategy which is in place is accurate but at times pushing to quickly to deliver on this strategy leaving customers behind
Pros: Very collaborative company with many great benefits, such as good vacation and very flexible workplace.  Salary was competitive and received annual salary increases

Cons: Very large company, easy to get lost in the bureaucracy.  Career growth difficult, hard to move from one job to another.
Advice: Don't depend on programs and nifty polished marketing like nonsense to gain employee loyalty and support.  Recognize that almost everyone wants the company to succeed as much as you do,
Pros: The compensation is good, a solid focus on new technology, SAP is always looking for the next business opportunity for company success and growth.  Work/life balance was good.

Cons: Legacy code base is what brought SAP to this stage.  It also presents unique challenges with respect to nimbleness in innovation which is required for SAP to retain its leadership role in the enterprise market..
Advice: Figure out a way to spin off smaller units that can become trail blazers in selected market segments to spawn additional sources of revenue.
Pros: Good culture, Employee friendly, Good overall package including benefits, and sundry perks including lunch. Plenty opportunities to work in different functions,

Cons: I bought into the work life balance, great place to work hype and was excited about  being a SAP employee until they abruptly eliminated my position.
Advice: In your haste to re-position SAP as a cloud company you overlooked a lot of employees that have a lot of valuable experience.
Pros: I worked for Sybase which was acquired by SAP and I was excited to be working for a leader in the enterprise software space. It seemed like a great opportunity.

Cons: Too many systems and processes that are ever changing. Create pathways for success not systems or processes that slow down success.
Advice: You have the best cloud products in the world. Don't screw them up with taking the incentives away from sales people. Either you pay them or someone else will.
Pros: The sky is the limit as far as opportunity. They really want you to be a top performer and give you a ton of tools to ensure you get there.

Cons: Large company can be political at times, lost in the shuffle.  It is difficult for your voice to be heard at a large organization, can be difficult to make change.
Advice: Do not simply promote people when there's open headcount - find a strategy for middle level managers who earn their keep.
Pros: Benefits, vacation, friendly company culture, work with smart people.  SAP has the best company culture I have seen where people treat you with respect and are extremely helpful.

Cons: There are not a lot of opportunities for directly after post grad, but all employees were extremely helpful in finding a path for you!
Advice: I think it would be beneficial for more people to be employed in these offices and responsibilities to be spread around a little more, so employees had more time to focus on individual tasks.
Pros: The mentors were extremely helpful, the atmosphere was phenomenal, everyone in the office was friendly. I really enjoyed it!

Cons: Too big of a company at times had to go through a multitude of other departments to get anything done.
Advice: None
Pros: I worked out of the US headquarters which had a great culture. Very european and relaxed yet everybody was working hard. I worked as an intern and felt as though I was given meaningful work and was actually doing something for the company, a feeling most interns cannot resonate with.

Cons: Ego's- there can be a lot of large male egos that you need to work with, which adds an unecessary element of complexity to the job. sometimes it comes down to he who shouts the loudest and it blcoks progress and team work
Advice: None
Pros: Great opportunites- it's up to you to drive your career. Opportunites are there to be taken, and those that drive and excel can take as many opportunities as they wish
