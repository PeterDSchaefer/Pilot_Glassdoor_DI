Cons: No cons to note at this time.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company with tons of opportunities for an engineer.

Cons: Although I worked on some interesting projects during my time there, the development timelines were so long that I didn't feel like I got a chance to see any of my design changes implemented into the vehicles. Outside of that, the Michigan cold is definitely a con if you're not from Michigan. Otherwise no real cons.
Advice: None
Pros: I was hired into the TRACK rotational program and my first job was in the CAE group. The leadership was supportive and helped me figure out my career objectives. They also allowed me to work on challenging and high-exposure projects.

Cons: Training and Development: While there are training programs available, some employees feel they are not sufficient or relevant to their career progression.

Work-Life Balance: Although there are flexible work arrangements, some employees still struggle with maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

Resource Allocation: There can be issues with the allocation of resources, with some departments feeling underfunded or understaffed.

Cultural Consistency: The company’s culture can vary significantly between departments and locations, leading to inconsistencies in the employee experience.
Advice: None
Pros: General Motros offers competitive salaries and comprehensive benefits packages

Cons: Senior leadership has been passing down edicts without data to back up the decisions 
We have been through 4 reorgs in the past year
We were forced to return to office while the leadership continued to be filled with fully remote positions
No clear company direction
We were told that we needed to save 2 billion dollars by reducing the workforce and cutting other costs. They said they couldn't afford the Union's demands. Then, as soon as the deal with the union was signed, they announced a $10 billion stock buyback. 
It has become clear that corporate values and company policies only apply to the workforce.
I personally do not like living in southeast Michigan. It's expensive, it's far from any outdoor activities. 

If I have to work for a company that won't include the workforce in decisions and will generally mistreat their workforce, I would at least like to live in a place I enjoy.

Most internal positions that we can apply for are only open to lateral moves, becoming very hard to get any sort of promotion.
Recent raises have not kept up with inflation at all
Advice: Back up your decisions with data. Don't lie to us. If it is just a command, then say that, don't lie and redirect.
Pros: I like my direct managers and coworkers
The pay and benefits are good

Cons: -was on a team where we were changing project every two weeks for a period of 6 months to a year. That meant we learned a lot but were masters of nothing. 
- whole building was laid off after being told there were no more layoffs. So current upper management is not very trustworthy.
- not flexible about remote work
Advice: None
Pros: -got hands on experience on a lot of different technology (Java/springboot angular react etc)
-great people all willing to help 
-if you’re interested in a different career choice they are willing to work with you to find you a spot on a different team that matches your interests
-great benefits and decent bonuses 
-work life balance was excellent 
*this is from the college entry level perspective

Cons: Pay isn't up to level it should be. Depending on team your in your growth and promotions are decided not based on your work. Your work load greatly varies depending on your team. Leadership chases newest coolest trends instead of working on core product and bettering that. California Leadership treats rest of the company as less than them.
Advice: GM should stop chasing and getting apple laid of people they release code to prod once in year.  It doesn't really compare.  You can create bad company at anytime. Just remember the reason people come to GM for reason leverage those instead of swimming with same way.  Long term it will help GM.
Pros: work on devices that people take there families in instead of hold them in there hands. Tech is cool and interesting.

Cons: Hires talent for one role and then places them into a completely different one.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, good pay, lots of PTO

Pros: nice team atmosphere and good work life balance

Cons: Bad hours, rude customers, not enough assistance form management
Advice: None
Pros: Work from home good pay

Cons: Chaos management or leadership brought by SLT since end of 2022,
And the forced back to office policy caused center or site couldn't provide enough cubes to fit everyone which means you have to share cubes or use hotel cubes when you back to office. While the policy required 3 days back and 2 days remote still seems working fine but if 5 days back office I can guarantee not a center will have enough workplace for everyone to sit down.
Advice: Direct report basically what I experienced are super nice people, even upper to some senior manager and director level.
But things changed when leadership level up to SLT, GM colleagues knows well recent times.
Pros: Good work life balance
At average or bit higher salary at local area, fair though not very high compare to Bay area, WA, etc;
Besides, direct report basically have good support and co-workers are super friendly and willing to help and listen.
Also provided many resources for self-learning and training programs as well.

Cons: Practical top level competitive decision making
Advice: None
Pros: Good working environment to work

Cons: Complex corporate culture with a lot of bureaucratic hurdles.
Advice: None
Pros: Good experience with managers and good benefits.

Cons: My latter 2 years on the other hand were terrible. Upper management was constantly pressuring our managers to make us work faster all while threatening layoffs and lying about the state of the company. The latter half of my service at GM I did not feel valued at all as an employee and if the same culture persists I would never recommend anyone work there.
Advice: Be more transparent and stop lying about whether layoffs are happening. Value the human beings who are working so hard for your benefit.
Pros: My first year at GM was pretty chill and I was working on interesting projects and was given a lot of room to learn.

Cons: Local union sucks
Management doesn’t care
Hard physical work
Advice: None
Pros: Union benefits are great. Once out of temp status pay is good

Cons: Deadlines are always hard to meet
Advice: None
Pros: Great people to work with

Cons: It felt like a giant high school where is a divide between the “haves” and the “have nots.” Good luck changing that if you are middle management and not a lifer or a director+

Pros: Some great people, opportunity and proactive systems and processes

Cons: Toxic work environment with stack ranking seniors vs new hires

Cons: Not a very good place to move up and make more money
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to learn new things as a new graduate

Cons: no cons i can say about
Advice: None
Pros: great company to work for

Cons: Pay increases didn’t keep up with economy. New hires were starting with more than experienced folks. Closed down the AZ site, laying off a lot of people.
Advice: Know your loyal employees worth. Help them grow (including salary). Don’t be a “yes man”  just to make yourself look good.
Pros: Benefits. PTO. Paid holidays. Work environment was chill. Colleagues were great.

Cons: Promotions for most require patience and a big project success.
Advice: Pay attention to communication from direct reports as much as that from your leadership.
Pros: Stable employer through the good times and bad. The company respects employees, highly values safety, and works hard to be a desirable workplace.

Cons: I do not have any Cons.
Advice: I do not have any advice here.
Pros: I really enjoy working at General Motors! The people are great and the work environment and the opportunities are good as well!

Cons: Can be very difficult starting here with no experience as your fate relies solely upon the luck of which team you get placed and how familiar they are with people new in the field
Advice: Learn how to treat people that have no experience in their field. Also for senior management, more transparency would reduce work anxiety by a lot.
Pros: Perfect place to work for experienced people within their field, generally very relaxed environment where you set the precedent for how hard your work will be.

Cons: Not enough benefits compared to software industry
Advice: None
Pros: a great place to work

Cons: So far everything is good
Advice: None
Pros: Good Benefits, Great work-life balance, Hybrid.

Cons: none at this time right now
Advice: None
Pros: Work life Balance
Good Pay for the area

Cons: Roles can be extremely siloed. Becoming an SME in your own area of the business often tunnels the utility you can provide and removes the potential for new skills to be developed. Your skills become less and less transferable if you don't prioritize your own professional development on the business side of the company.
Advice: Reversing the commitments made in recent years such as keeping annual salary raises consistent with inflation and allowing for permanent work from home solutions has created a sense of distrust with senior leadership.
Pros: GM's benefits package, salary commitments, and level of responsibility granted to new employees is unmatched. Especially for students with undecided futures and general business degrees, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to take on managing my own sector of the business in many other companies.

Cons: Senior leadership is inconsistent and outright lies sometimes. Lower pay than other places
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is good. Lots of teams to switch between over time

Cons: No work/life balance. The culture here is horrible. They come up with a new way to lay ppl off every 6 weeks. Everyday at work is like clocking in at the Hunger Games. Avoid this place if possible. Find an employer that actually values you as an employee.
Advice: Why bother? They don't care.
Pros: In this current job market, it's better than being unemployed.

Cons: EV transition has been a disaster.
Advice: None
Pros: Great Pay and solid leadership.

Cons: GM is a more old school company with old school values. They do not hold up to the infrastructure, code quality, or amenities that many software engineers have come to expect. They want to rebrand themselves as a tech company but are a bit lost in how to make that happen.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay (for the area), little to no overtime required (depending on your role), getting to work in a field that is actually newly emerging with lots of potential (EVs), plenty of different areas to work in.

Cons: Dog eat dog culture. Stacked ranking, Mandatory “underperfoeming” ranking of employees
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay, hybrid office requirement

Cons: I don't feel elevated by the talent there. There are some very talented people, but it feels like most of the people are there because they couldn't find any other jobs, and it shows. Additionally, there aren't many growth opportunities.
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, great work life balance.

Cons: “Return to work” policy with no exceptions eliminates or extremely limits opportunities for staying with the company or career growth there if you aren’t near a major office. Attempts at diversity feel performative because they aren’t backed up in practice.
Advice: Actually listen to and follow feedback
Pros: Solid pay and benefits. Good opportunities for growth if you want that but also plenty of roles you can stay in longer term. Good work life balance in most roles.

Cons: You might not get the role you are most interested in
Advice: None
Pros: It is a great way to understand the whole company

Pros: It is a great way to understand the whole company

Cons: Slow moving and not enough employees
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work on new software

Cons: GM's senior leadership team (SLT) has gone back on their word several times over the past year.

A year and a half ago they said "work appropriately" (which allowed employees and their direct managers to choose when work at home or in office was needed) was here to stay. However, just a few months later, they started requiring us to be in office three days a week. Now, starting January, they are also mandating which of those three days we have to be in office. To make it worse, my whole team is in a different location, so I now have to come in office just to be on Teams calls all day...

Also, there have been multiple times this year the SLT said there would be no layoffs and then proceeded to do layoffs a month or two later. One of these layoffs included closing an entire IT center in Arizona with +900 people.

Through this all, SLT has not acted on feedback from employees or addressed our concerns. Work things the way they are, I would strongly recommend looking somewhere else for a job.
Advice: Listen to employee feedback and let us be where we actually do our best work.
Pros: It really depends on the direct managers you get. If you have good managers then work life balance can be really good and they advocate for you when it comes time for promotions at the end of the year.

The 401k match is also really good and health insurance doesn't cost to much.

Cons: in office working, lack of communication, not strong team

Advice: None
Pros: Laid back environment

Great for resume

Cons: Stressful environment a lot of blame game leadership has no emotional intelligence and not all but a lot of your staff can be difficult to work with depending on the shift and culture at that Plant.

Cons: Constant re-orgs
Industry that is flailing around trying things (i guess every industry that isn't Generative AI or HW related to Generative AI is flailing right now)
Despite all the rolling layoffs and cuts, there are *still* a core group of people that are just not open to change.
Advice: I don't have a Harvard, or Wharton MBA, and I never worked for a "tech company" as a data scientist or a senior leader ... so why would management listen to anything I say lol? I can't juice the stock price, or magically change the "global competitive landscape and the headwinds we face". I am just here to be as useful as possible till I am inevitably laid off.

- Zero work life balance
- Working 6-7 days a week every week without say and if you don’t come in, you’re fired 
- Have to cover your counterparts when they take PTO in addition to the 70-80 hour work weeks

Pros: Great if you want to work 80+ hours a week and have it be forced lol (non-union employee as a salary supervisor)

-they want all the personal information on your place of worship to allow you to have your religion. making your new religion the manufacturing of cars.
-the only requirement for working in vehicle assembly is a pulse, so buyers beware. I'm telling everyone i know to never buy anything manufactured by GM ever,
-Admittedly nobody acknowledges that HR is there for them, but in reality the only time that they show up is to pull the rug out from underneath you.

Advice: None
Pros: Really an amazing place to work at thus far. Great teammates and the leaders I’ve had to work with, created a healthy space to work.

Cons: The only con I can think of is the org changes. Teams swap every couple of months, so just get used to meeting new people. This could also be considered a benefit for making connections.

1) Community: Most engineer here are very friendly and want to help for newbies such as I,

Pros: GM has competitive compensation and benefits. As a large complex company there are opportunities for diverse experiences and specializations.

Cons: Management is mainly a bunch of former sales people and accountants.

The software in the company is literally the worst I've ever seen.

Management doesn't actually understand how modern software development works and just chases fads and plays buzzword bingo. Why? Because they don't actually know what they're doing.

Due to how bad GM is, it's difficult to leave because most companies don't want to hire ex-GM. Terrible rep.
Advice: The senior leadership at GM needs to be replaced and middle management needs to be thoroughly reduced. Too many chiefs and not enough workers.

Advice: None
Pros: If you play it well, you can get away with working 20-25 hrs per week

Cons: Work in a big company has to be divided by tens of thousands of people so the work that you get to do can feel pretty small and not worth much in the grand scheme of the company.

Pros: Very Personalable work environment and High Mentorship Culture

Cons: The downsides of GM is that it, like most companies, is always changing. Salespeople stay in roles from 6 months to 2 years maximum. Direction from Detroit were always done from their perspective, not realizing that a smaller office has different needs. It was challenging to stay within company guidelines when those guidelines were drawn from farther away.
Advice: The concept of simplification and doing more with less should apply to the people managing, not those DOING.  Having to do one job is enough, being asked to take on 3 different positions is too much.
Pros: Working at GM is like a huge chaotic family reunion; some things are amazing and other times contentious. If you are passionate about cars it is amazing to see the latest innovations and be a part of it. The small office atmosphere for the Sales branches had a feel of a cooperative small office.

Advice: None
Pros: Great pay, good room for advancement!

Cons: So many meetings to attend
Advice: None
Pros: Great work place. Great pay

Cons: I happened to land in a not so great org in IT and had some really horrible managers during my time there. One especially would bully her team members until enough of a pattern was established that people started reporting her to HR. She seemed to be friends with a higher up manager and only got moved around until she finally left the company to wreak havoc elsewhere. I also had an developer friend on a different team that got bullied out until she quit. The automotive industry tends to have layoffs pretty often even in good times, and very often during the year that UAW contracts need to be renegotiated. The performance review structure has changed recently to include more feedback from your manager every quarter. I would say GM is a better option for business backgrounds than software developers. And college hires tend to get promoted more than individual contributors due to their raise structure. I feel my skills stagnated during my time there, but some have done well, YMMV. And those I know who have left, usually make more $$$ elsewhere.
Advice: Assume goodness, what a crock.
Pros: It's a very good company for those just starting out in their careers since they tend to hire a lot of new college graduates and cater to their training and development. Depending on what area you get into, and your management, your experience can vary widely. They do have a very generous parental/family leave policy, just implemented in the past few years. They also have a very generous tuition reimbursement program. Once established, there are opportunities to apply for international assignments.

Cons: Lies in interview and lies/Passive Aggressive leadership in workplace
No work life balance
Extreme Politics
Fantasy Island....
Unstable software
Very unhappy customers
Advice: It was said during the end of year speech, at GM motorsports  "We are a family and the foundation of a family is built on trust" During the interview I was told lies about this position. Thus my "relationship", with my new family was founded on lies. Management should be proud they have created such a "knives in back", extremes politics and potentially life wrecking environment for employees. You need to change the unethical people in leadership of GM motorsports software. Lastly, it also very telling of how this team is managed when you are on your 7th PO/PM in 3 years....

Advice: None
Pros: Guranteed bonus if you meet expectations

Cons: Senior Leadership has been trying to hire in the right person to change the trajectory of the company on the IT and strategy side. They hired a strategy guy - a few reorgs, but no noticeable changes. They hired a digital product guy from pixar - a few reorgs, no noticeable changes. Now they hire an Apple guy who so far has only been working to bring in people he knows from silicon valley. He appears to not really have a plan other than using this experience as an internship to learn from Mary Barra. Expected result - a few reorgs, no noticeable changes.
Advice: With a company as old and storied as GM you cannot hire a visionary to dramatically change everything. They are met with too much resistance - often from within the C Suite itself. Inertia is real and when you try to fabricate change faster than the organization can absorb it you usually degrade the culture with few if any measurable improvements to the bottom line. If you want rapid change - spin things off like Cruise and Brightdrop. Let those things incubate outside of the womb that is still really just trying to build cars and put them on dealer lots. Otherwise the collateral damage of trying to inject change could actually erode the core, and sacrifice the culture that has been hard won over the past decade.

Cons: Bureaucracy to the extreme.  Often purely for the sake of it, adding no value or safe guards. Leadership changes constantly making it hard to connect with what the "vision of the day" is. With that vagueness, many don't have a good goal post to work towards and seem to languish while a few work way to hard to push the product through the machine.
Advice: Invest in your technical leaders more and silicone valley less.
Pros: Some really cutting edge stuff to work on with room to collaborate and invent.  Rewarding in positions I have had to be close to the final product and drive what you worked on.  There are some really smart people here, and if you align with them there is a lot to learn.

Cons: Like any large company, there are some frustrations when it comes to big initiatives being rolled out. The pendulum can swing widely from one direction to another.
Advice: Suggestion would be to hold managers, execs, and sr. execs more accountable.  If a large initiative, program, etc. is not successful, make sure the feedback gets to them and if not corrected, promote up and comers who are more nimble and can get the job done.
Pros: GM has some of the best people to learn from. Everyone is extremely helpful and wants you to be successful. There are also numerous career opportunities and different parts of the business that you can learn and you're encouraged to do so. It's humbling being a part of such a great group of people and experts in their field.

Cons: Very in depth knowledge you must learn
Advice: None
Pros: Fantastic team to work with

Cons: 1.People leaders within the SW space need to be reduced to enable rapid collaboration.They just get in the way of workflow more than helping, coming up with processes for the sake of it. The few that try to collaborate at the working level get easily flustered but having said this there is no doubt there is year over year changes in people leaders that is going in the right direction. 2.In house SW development quality is very poor to put it nicely. 3.Infotainment design and execution is several years behind competitors , needs a complete overhaul fastest option of it being paying suppliers for the next few years to get closer to competition than trying to do it ourselves

This is the single biggest reason for things not falling apart 2.Decent pay ,a good benefits package. 3.A lot of new employees replacing old hands that left are doing well to cover them when provided with the right guidance and the freedom to go about their way to get work done. 4.Mary and the executive leadership are doing their best and to march towards business goals.Its Good to see executives genuinely try.

Pros: Great people to work with

Cons: You're a cog in the machine. As much as GM pushes HR, it is a boys club/ lots of nepotism. Sr. directors manipulate hiring for friends/family who are not qualified blatantly out in the open. UAW can be very difficult to work with/ breeds a lot of issues.

Advice: None
Pros: - Tons of resources for new engineers 
- Lots of growth opportunities

Cons: They have layoffs every other year and are random. They don’t help people get to positions they want to be in and take people out of the positions they want to be in. Most of the managers have no IT experience. But since they have an mba they get hired over people who are more qualified.

Advice: None
Pros: Some coworkers at gm make it easier to stay.

Cons: GM is plagued by too much mid-management creating fiefdoms and uncooperative behaviors. The executive level mgmt has vision but can't seem to carry it out and decommits too early. Their products are middling and poorly conceived with lots of obvious mistakes making it through production.
Advice: GM needs a complete reboot (unfortunately the bankruptcy didn't achieve enough). The culture is poisoned and despite layoffs and early retirement offers there are still far too many people getting in the way rather than adding to the cause.
Pros: Great compensation keeps people around for long careers. Lots of potential, huge market of captive consumers begging them for new products.

Cons: It seemed like there were no company-wide standards for coding practices or app design. Each team had their own way of doing things, which made cross-collaboration difficult.
Advice: None
Pros: The company is big, so there is a lot of existing structure.

Cons: The culture in the company is that employees are expected to always be available, even on vacations.

Pros: The pay I receive cannot be matched.

Cons: No career growth
no food in office
Advice: None
Pros: Great work culture
great work life balance

Cons: Lack of growth in one area of the business, therefore you're forced to move around to climb the pay levels at GM. Levels are 6, 7, 8, 9th and level unknown.

Cons: slow moving large company with all the issues that come along with that
Advice: None
Pros: generous bonus structure and benefits packages.

Cons: Job insecurity: during a lay-off round, sleep is a four letter word Labor is a a commodity: You're on your own. Don't get comfortable with the chair you sit in. You'll move before it's warm. Sometimes you'll move as a team, other times you'll move on your own. High expectations: Expectations aren't always expressed. You have to learn through the grapevines and they mess with your work-life balance. Example: if they give you a cell phone (pretty much standard now) it's expected to be on you pretty much 24/7 and it's not for private use. I used it as such anyway though, because I'm not going to carry around two phones. Another one: at a level 7 you're pretty much expected to work all the time. Not doing that precludes you from moving up the ladder, because it's a rat race. I recommend it, because in comparison to other US employers, GM is pretty good.
Advice: Barra has done great work, but management needs to come off their high horse and start to live what they preach about the GM family. That should be more than saving cash-back points for oil changes and accessories.
Pros: Job stability: In between lay-off rounds you're in a safe place. Work-life balance: Has improved, but there are still some old-school expectations You contribute to stuff that dreams are made of.

Pros: Good benefits and compensastion while living in Michigan

Advice: None
Pros: it's a great team in the body shop area and the work is very engaging and hands on

Cons: The SR system has gotten a lot better, but a lot of the work can be a series of requests and approvals you have to account for in planning. Something you cant really get away from in a company this big, but its always a risk in planning. Leadership is all over the place about layoffs and layoffs. Most the employees think its sketchy. Only main con is compensation for those who do more than others. I get inflation is a thing now so you have to hire new college hires and experienced hires for more, but those who have been here through the thick and thin are also impacted by inflation. New college hires coming in close to level 7s in terms of salary is a slap in the face when you dont plan on giving us any sort of adjustment.
Advice: None
Pros: Started here out of college and worked my way up to a mid-senior level 7. I think your experience here is mainly impacted on where you land in terms of space/org and manager. I personally loved my experience and the opportunity to grow where you are or move laterally is there. My managers have always been supportive and cared about how I was. Just depends if you decided to outshine others or not. Also an easy place to coast if you are looking for something of that nature. Work life balance has always been awesome. Management has always been flexible for me. Unless you are a slacker, annual raises were always 3-4% maybe more. Bonuses are up and down, but last few years have been good. PTO and Holidays are awesome because of the factory shut downs.

Cons: Fast paced, a lot of programs to manage at once
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay and benefits, I appreciate the flexibility of my day to day.

Cons: - Pay is lower than essentially every tech company, GM will claim they want a tech presence but will always be a corporate car company first. By this I mean at a certain point the only way to make career progress is to go management route and climb through endless ranks of management. - GM invests a lot into new hires and as a result has a lot of turnover after 2 years (New hires have to pay back relocation) - Not a lot of senior talent here.
Advice: Attracting and retaining senior talent would provide financial rewards in both the sort and long run. More technical leadership leads to higher reliability / efficiency and less buggy code bases. Its more expensive to rebuild a system several times than to build a system with the experience of forsight.
Pros: - As a senior you are able to hop on more impactful teams since there is a lack of senior talent. - Job security used to be more certain but after layoffs this pro may have shifted. - Work life balance varies, a lot of college new hires like to work weekends and work late to prove themselves but this culture is not expected. It really just depends on the team.

Cons: None, GM is not a perfect place, but they are working very hard to become one.
Advice: None to share at this time.
Pros: Great Benefits and Bonuses, and Team Environment

Cons: Lot of Red tape to get things done
