Cons: There is a lot of nepotism in the Spanish office and incompetent people are being promoted to managers. it is sad to see to see that they give off a global image but then act very Spanish. Lack of the authentic Scandinavian culture from Sweden and not all employees have the same rights. HR sometimes 'forgets" to communicate and is ruling the office with the iron fist(Spanish way). i can't remember if I ever had an honest and objective performance review. The worst of it all is that headquarters don't care about this office and see this place as another cheap labour location.

Low salary budget, almost none trainings. To much manual work( old financial systems, procedures) for a multinational company that sells premium vehicles, 0 investments in the automation and in the people. The employees are the ones who raise the company.
Advice: Trainings for the management for developing soft skills, communication, training ( internationals) to open the mind.
Pros: The company is lucky to have, had, some employees with ethic skills, soft skills, responsible, but who doesn't know to appreciate them.

Cons: The leadership is incompetent at most levels. Managers bullies employees with the support of the HR organization. The so called "speak up culture" is in practice only allowed if it is positive. No constructive criticism of feedback is accepted. Managers support each other and distance themselves from the employees. 50% of all manager recruitments are friends according to a union survey. The manager culture is rotten to the core. Leave if you can.
Advice: The management needs to be replaced on all levels and a new sound culture needs to be nurtured from scratch and down to up. This includes the complete HR organization. Listen to the employees and the unions. Work together on a rebirth of the company and management culture or die as a company. It might be too late already to do something about it.

Cons: High bearocray like any other big company.
Advice: None
Pros: Using state or the art tools 
Ability to innovate

Cons: I had the opportunity to work for this company, and I must say that my overall experience was quite disappointing. The company is deeply rooted in old-fashioned practices and seems to operate with a work philosophy from the 80s. One of the major drawbacks is their claim of striving to become a software company, yet the reality is quite different. The management's approach to people and work resembles something from the 80s, lacking modern flexibility and innovation. Salary adjustments are incredibly rare, and there is a prevalent culture of micro-management, which creates an extremely toxic environment. For any software engineer in the market, I strongly advise against considering this company. The lack of flexibility, slow adaptation to new technologies, and toxic work environment make it an unfavorable choice. If you value a modern work culture that encourages growth and innovation, this company is definitely not the place for you.

Cons: It's been a good number of years since Volvo Cars started its agile transformation.

Until now, the company has little trust in the reliability of the individuals filling agile roles (RTE, PM, SM, PO).

The line management is a complete pain in the head.

If you go around in the corridors of Volvo Cars, and pick any random PO/SM and ask them their take on the line management, they would tell you "I hate them, they are horrible".

In the new organization structure at Volvo Cars, the number of layers of line management was reduced. It's high time to terminate the line management organization in its entirety and transfer its responsibilities (and they're trifling for what matters) to the agile roles in the organization.

The current line management may assume agile roles. If they don't want it, they have the door, they can go back to the Ericsson they have already ruined!

- Competence varies from team to team.
- Software competence is atrocious.
- Executives have been there for more than 15 to 20 years. Says a lot about what is hindering growth in the company.
- Employees at Stockholm office are NEGLECTED on all levels. [From benefits to office space / location]
- Not diverse at all. [Just go take a look at the executive team.
- New blood held back due to bureaucracy.

Design reorg a year ago doesn't address the root of the problem. Lots of churn in the company, especially in the stockholm office, resulting in the need to ramp up hiring in other Swedish cities or lure people to move.
Advice: Buckle up for a rough ride. We are too slow. Empower the new hires to build great digital products rather than hinder them with the old, otherwise you risk losing more talent.

Start to think and act more like a global company instead of thinking within your own confines of Torslanda. 

Promote more women and POCs. Have a clearer plan for ICs to progress their career.
Pros: - Amazing colleagues.
- Good benefits for being a Swedish company.
- Beautiful cars / products.
- Great brand values.
- Safety is key. [But other competitors are on par or catching up]

Pros: Good learning opportunity. Very nice subordinates..

Cons: Slow and lengthy process for decision making.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company with amazing people. Open and transperent corporate culture.

Cons: - Big organization with some slow processes and in the middle of a reorg at the moment.
- The company is "Gothenburg-heavy", most of the decisions are made there, and the Stockholm office lacks some perks they have in Gothenburg (on-site restaurants, gym facilities, etc.)
- Stockholm office is too sterile (plain white walls, grey floor carpet, no decoration, no colors).
- I miss some perks I had at my previous employers (tech education budget for courses and conferences, massage in the office, language course, gym membership, top-notch computer and phone, fika, Friday beer, hack days, meetups, swag, etc.)
Advice: The digital transformation is a good step, but maybe try to make the company and the office a bit more "trendy" so you don't have to solely rely on high salary offers when it comes to attracting young talents.
Pros: - Good office location in downtown Stockholm; free fruits, coffee and soda; playing room.
- Decent work equipment (Macbook Pro and iPhone, but not the newest models like at other companies ).
- Nice, talented coworkers, international environment.
- Meaningful product, interesting project (mine at least is).
- Really good salary (Volvo Cars is able and willing to pay the price of the best talent, they seduce people from top Swedish tech companies like Spotify, Klarna, King, iZettle).
- Perks (pension contribution, annual bonus, discount on cars, etc.)

Cons: Management need to show vision
slow changes
Advice: None
Pros: good benefits
great colleagues
you get to drive a nice car but it is a bit outside the city

Advice: None
Pros: - Work-life balance

Cons: Some managers are less good
Advice: None
Pros: Talented cooworkers
Good atmosphere
Good opportunities within the company

Cons: Stressfull, overtime every week, criminal people in the management and lots of substance abuse. Horrible culture and place to be.
Advice: Clean up in the organization and make it legit.
Pros: Good salary but that probably the only thing worth mentioning about this company

Cons: The company is very conservative, which slows its innovation and market share growth.  Because employee retention is so high, there is limited opportunity to grow into new positions, and they are the slowest I've ever experienced with regard to static promotions (eg moving someone from an engineer to senior engineer, which doesn't require a vacated position).  The salaries are also very low compared to similar positions in automotive companies located outside of Sweden.
Advice: None
Pros: The work environment is relaxed and positive, and one of their greatest strengths is their employee retention.  With so many people that have been working together for so long, the company works well together in many ways.  The company has many ways in which it is employee centric and offers a lot of possibility to move around within the organization.  Current changes in corporate structure may improve cross-functional work and information exchange, but it remains to be seen as it's a work in progress.  The benefits are good and the management is flexible to the life interests and demands outside of work.

Cons: It is not clear what career path you can have when you join the company. Currently there is a lot of encouragement towards horizontal moves of people, cross-functionally. The Swedish mindset and culture brings positives, such as a flat organization and democracy, and a great work-life balance, but it also generates a laid back working culture, with very few ambitious people willing to walk the extra mile.
Advice: None
Pros: The designed around you culture means there is a lot of focus on people development and the leadership practices are oriented towards positive and constructive feedback, encouraging employees to have initiative and be proactive. The industry as such is very dynamic and rapidly changing, and working for Volvo which is a quite small player compared to BMW or Mercedes, means more exposure to the industry, different departments and projects.

Cons: 1. Culture discourages working from home
2. Hard to increase salary while under contract. 
3. Architects have way too much control over the day to day work and implementations of the software developers.
4. Overtime requests are quite common (once to twice a year).
5. Not much fun or perks at the office
6. Office space and area (Torslanda) is boring and too far from the city
Advice: More autonomy to software engineers.
more perks in the office. (breakfast, snacks, music...etc.)
More software engineers closer to the city to be in par with other software companies
Pros: 1. Everything shifting to Agile and therefore things are moving a lot faster
Teams are having more and more autonomy to build products
2. You manage your own time.
3. Easy to change jobs within the company.
4. Management encourages to build competence (pays for courses, books and provides rewards for passing courses)

Cons: Old school leadership way too common, generally poor senior management behaviors and narcissist CEO not fitting a transformation to tech. Confuses culture for campus feel and ping pong tables.  Needs to hire people for virtual teams to meet skills gap but focus on office presence simultaneously. Younger and lower level leadership much more promising but need to act like bumpers currently. Deep but not broad specialists - sub optimization of almost everything main rule.
Advice: Address your own and others behaviors, stop trying to control yourself to success. Embrace the needed software culture, dare to let go of control and act like know-it-all’s  and stop behaving like power hungry VPs from the 90s. Embarrassing.
Pros: Good intent culture. People approachable and kind. Wants to modernize and transform itself and succeeds in parts. Decent pay since HR stopped interfering. Actually do have a unique position as a (comparatively) fast mover into mobility in premium segment. Strong brand.

Cons: Compensation for software developers is way less than in any German OEM, even not talking about Tesla or any other US-based company. Benefits program is also incredibly poor: it is super cool to buy a new Volvo with a 15% discount but it is still not affordable for a person who is working as a software developer without a loan for 5-7 years.
Advice: If you would like to be like Tesla for a software engineer, you must be as attractive as Tesla. Otherwise really good engineers will never prioritize Volvo's offer over Tesla's offer. Right now Tesla is a way ahead of you.
Meanwhile, for manufacturer workers the situation is completely opposite, it think you're better than Tesla.
Pros: Company is investing a lot of money in an attempt to beat Tesla. Volvo Cars is really trying to change from being a pure vehicle manufacturer to the software oriented OEM brand.

Cons: - The full-time employees had to work too much, and it didn't seem to be temporary. 
- So much meetings nobody had time to do their work. Both these things gives a hint of a malfunctioning work environment.
- Poor salary, considering one year to M.Sc. and doing relevant tasks. The salary among the full-time employees where not especially competitive either.
Advice: None
Pros: - Very good colleagues and closest manager were great. The were welcoming and supportive.
- Interesting tasks that was needed to be done and not just something stupid you because the summer intern have to do something.
- Good insight in work life and a good experience for the future.
- Good career opportunities as the contacts that were made there could be used for M.Sc. thesis opportunities and a first job after graduation.

Cons: Auto industry is experiencing a disruption and Volvo Cars is not fully ready for it. Currently working at the autonomous driving department, which means major part of the job is securing the delivery from the suppliers (integration/testing/analysis) to guarantee the car safety, but not much of real technical development. There is a lack of personal competence development as an engineer. Obscure future about the merge with Geely Auto.
Advice: Vertical integration with suppliers, further remove the workforce redundancies / duplicate functions within the company or subsidiary companies.
Pros: Care and respect for people. Nice and competitive colleagues to work with. Good sales number so far until Oct 2020, so the business runs well.

Cons: It is never enough, if you work hard, they want you to work harder 

Volvo gent should be more important than your private life 

Bad communication 

Work pressure to high 

Pretend to be a good employer  but only cares about making cars and profit 

Benefits of the company are only adapted for the people Who are making the rules instead of those Who are making the cars
Advice: Have more respect for the People Who work for the company
Pros: Good salary, good payment 

Company car program

A lot of benefits such as bonus and insurances 

Company restaurant with cheap food 

Nice cars

Cons: If you are a serious software developer, please keep away from VolvoCars. This is a quite traditional company. Most managers did not have a strong background in the software area, even in sometime, they refuse to do the change as a software company. 
Lots of people only have the ability to talk, open the meeting, As a developer, please keep away from this company.

By the way, this is the first company what I have meet, the ScM was a dedicated role, whose jobs is talk, talk, talk.......
Advice: Please try to learn some knowledge of software engineer. give respect to the software engineer instead of dedicated ScM.
Pros: work/life balance. work/life balance.work/life balance.work/life balance.work/life balance.

Cons: A lot of change of organisation and roles going on. Still some traditional OEM culture going on with people resisting change and challenge of the business models.
Advice: Dare to challenge old models and try the new. Give people a chance to grow into roles, hire people with right mindset and train on the job. Hire managers who can manage people not only the project.
Pros: Great work life balance. Development opportunities within company to try out new things. Great people and culture. A lot of growth and forward spirit. Good benefits.

Cons: - No governance on employee performance
- Promotions are 100% subjective
- Outdated digital infrastructure 
- Average age is high thus the mindset and culture are very old
- HQ is almost 90% Swedes, major steps needed for international diversity
- Regions are highly disconnected from HQ
- Workplace is very bland and boring,  feels like 1990s
- Extremely slow decision making
Advice: - Hire more internationals
- Hire younger people
- Govern employee performance
- Understand the importance of data and digital infrastructure
Pros: - Growing and recognized brand
- Decent product portfolio
- Tons of development opportunities

Cons: Totally toxic culture in Australia NSC.  HQ actively promotes a whisteblower program, which enables disgruntled employees &amp; dealers to tell outrageous lies about good employees. Targeted employees axed on basis of biased police style investigations, and without opportunity to answer accusations. 
Structure of bonus program actively favors head office senior management  and discriminates against local team.
Advice: Get real about ethics and culture. Build a realistic  culture based on people. Time serving seat warmers have too much say.  Targets are realistic, but budgets &amp; resources aren't consistent. Allow  a more stable plan to achieve growth targets
Pros: Fantastic Product, ambitious plans, some good colleagues (outside the clique). Roomy offices, good furniture. Company car policy very reasonable. Gender equal pay structures

Cons: A traditional automotive company trying to become a Tech company. People working in tech should expect a long and bumpy road during this journey to Agile ways of working across the entire organisation in making lightning fast decisions and shifting quickly with the trends.
Advice: None
Pros: Equal opportunity employer. Rich history and prestige  building the world's safest cars. Starting an exciting new phase into making only electrified vehicles from 2021.

Cons: It’s management only looks flat, the old established systems are not possible to change even if they are proven wrong, for non-Swedish it is more difficult to get promotions, innovation is less focused upon, the management and the unions would rarely intervene if there is a problem leaving the employee vulnerable to toxic conditions.
Advice: None
Pros: It is almost what you expect from a corporation: good benefits, international community, lots of projects to work with and etc

Cons: Because of the set up of the program, you rotate to a new role every 4-6 months and therefore you feel as the ‘new person’ a lot. It’s not really a con, just something that might be challenging for some.
Advice: None
Pros: The graduate program is a great way to learn about different parts of the company, to become really confident in the business as well as comfortable with uncertainty.

Cons: Old company with strong traditions, some people might be resistant to change
Advice: Regarding the current transformation I think an entrepreneurial approach to validating the new business models is essential to success
Pros: Great resources for self-improvement
Great culture (engagement, openness, diversity, ethics)
Interesting transformation of the company. Volvo is in a nice place right now with a focus on mobility services, electrification and autonomous drive.

Cons: There is a risk that the processes becomes too bureaucratic due to Volvos size. Too much administation reduces creative time for the engineers.
Advice: Continue on the path towards more efficient and environmental products packed with innovative solutions that make the customers lives better.
Pros: Innovative and caring corporation with great products. Volvo is well equiped to handle the changing environment and new customer demands. A lot of creative persons.

Cons: Not yet a global company. Still most employees work in either China or Sweden. Needs to work on more female leaders and a better international balance of management.
Advice: Don't forget to give credit to those who work with great loyalty to construct and produce these beautiful cars.
Pros: A Company in ramp-up phase with a lot of exiting products ahead. Building up capabilities for autonomous drive and e-commerce.

Cons: Since the culture is not very aggressive, the development is slow too except the market in China. Global strategy is very centralized in Sweden HQ, and there is less communication between different country markets.
Advice: None
Pros: Work-life balance, never overload, very Swedish. The culture is very much to "avoid conflicts" and is not very performance driven - very easy to survive in such environment.

Cons: Multinational typical bureaucratic procedures.
