Cons: Worst place for a Software Engineer to make any kind of career. Every single department is a disaster, ego tripping everywhere, everyone is trying to reach the end of the month to get their salaries for the next one. No one has any idea how to make software, they think that's like making a car, it doesn't work this way.

No one can't be fired, this is a nest of incompetence.
Advice: Fire incompetent people and take some time to make some reflection about yourselves. Whatever decision you are going to take soon, doing taking this in mind, do actual people have the competence to "Drive the future of mobility"? If not... fire them. This whole situation is contraproducent for the goals of the company, this many external companies... they's no accountability, ownership for anything we do, the daily job is reduced to a game of blaming others. It's just a big hierarchical structure, where everyone is blaming and fingerpointing each other for their mistakes instead of working as a team towards a common goal, this mindset percolates even in small departments and even amongst team members, or teams.
Pros: Stability, pension, the workers council will make sure to make you stay (although this is bad, as incompetent people will always stay)

Where to start?
• Poor training, had no idea what was going on for the majority of my employment and therefore I didnt learn anything to help me develop any skills.
•Lack of communication between all the departments, leads to a lot of confusion
•Manager was way too passive aggressive 
•The Sales team were quite good at returning calls, however some members of the service team just dont care (I dont blame them) but the consequences are that customers get angry at le receptionist. (Which reminder, wasnt trained for)
•Diversity is probably good, the other employees had low key racist comments or discriminatory comments to certain races etc.

Additional meh things:
•The layout of the place made it very hard to see things and do my job
•Update employee areas please, the toilets were horrible, the kitchen was just grim and had very basic things, just a kettle actually
•You would think for a multi million or billion company they would provide more for the staff like lunch, better utilities, even caring and that's free
•Sick isnt paid which is just stupid 

Probably a lot more, but my experience is mine alone. I wouldn't recommend working here in the dealerships as they are quite boring, high pressure, confused management and bad work/life balance.
