Pros: Work Life Balance Good work culture

Cons: Weak management, high workload, low level of trainings. Typical corporate politics.
Advice: Provide proper training and coaching to motivate and empower people. They expect too much from employees getting paid average salaries. Talk less and do more.
Pros: Flexible working, big office, plenty of autonomy, opportunities for development and moving departments.

Cons: Workload imbalance. Instead of hiring best people for process improvement or consultants - they guise continuous improvement efforts in games and targets that every employee must reach. They would tire people out on delivering cost efficient measures and most that an employee can get is some pennies along with a high five. No, they don't patent ideas - they claim it as the company's.
Advice: Hire a consultant, hire the best so they can pass it on - they can develop people. Don't preach about work life balance when you would send a message on a Sunday night asking people to check their laptop since a truck needs to be rescheduled.
Pros: They are very particular with the safety of their people, whatever aspect it can be. The company would provide all of the things one needs, including the best healthcare privileges and allowances. Their benefits are top tier coming from a person who has worked in a number of multinational companies.

Cons: Leaders are horrible - they aren't classed as leaders but more like BOSSES! Very biased and racist leaders. They DO NOT care for their employees at all. Luckily John the so called CPO has left the company. Although his title says Chief People Officer, he is not at all a people person. Alec who is a so called Head of Comms, just doesn't know how to communicate with the business in his comms and ends up being very harsh in his articles that end up hurting employee's feelings (very arrogant and shrewd person). Managers on the floor as well aren't very great. If you're working for Shell Energy - you're just another number for them making them money. People don't last long there because the work culture isn't good at all. This place is filled with bossy and arrogant people. No scope for development. You will only get a chance to develop if you are good buddies with the bosses!
Advice: Appreciate your employees. If you do it - do it fairly. Help your employees to grow and develop. Don't tell them how to do their JOB - they are hired for a reason, instead give them tools to excel and grow in what they are hired for. Don't just sack people just because they don't agree with your way of thinking... Instead hear out and listen to their views - it will help you being open minded not narrow minded! By giving your employees a fair chance to grow it will not only benefit them but in the long run it will benefit your company. Happy employees = Happy clients and Great customer service + great company culture. Yes Financial goals are important however employees should be kept at the heart of anything you do (remember actions speak louder than words).

Cons: My biggest career mistake was to join SBO bangalore. If you are in IT , you will certainly loose all your IT Skills. Inflated CTC, frequent reorgs/restructure, un-certainty, job-insecurity are some of the notable features. All roles are 4 year contract only.
 Leadership with no vision, and who believe in micromanagement. If you are a people manager and that too in Bangalore, you will not be respected by the bosses sitting in UK and Nederland. All the talk about inclusive culture is just a showoff.
