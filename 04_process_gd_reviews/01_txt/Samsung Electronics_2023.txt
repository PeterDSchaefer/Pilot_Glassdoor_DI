Cons: ...however their values get trashed by the culture which is about running around like a headless chicken, spinning wheels, doing things that don't really add any value just to look busy. Expertise is frowned upon in favour of just spinning wheels and wasting time on pointless leadership team appeasement. Empowerment non-existent in favour of box-ticking for leadership. Very little learning and development at all after the probation period. The epitome of that definition of madness where they just want to do the same thing over and again expecting a different result...but they never get it. Understanding of data and statistics is almost non-existent, with the rule being that it's only used to prove the opinion of the person using it, never to open up learning to inform action. Leadership team is an assortment of people from failed enterprises, not successful and market-beating ones. No internal job move opportunities unless you've been on the grad scheme, then it's a case of rolling out the red carpet. Made a big song and dance about having work-life balance but then those without kids or a significant interest in life outside the 8-6 set the tone for what's expected and aggressively hound those whose work isn't their life. Any expertise you offer will at best be slyly appropriated by the audience and no credit will be given to the source at all - this is the worst organisation I've ever been in for this sort of thing; at worst you'll be openly told off for daring to have an original thought.
Advice: None - it was all given during the time I was there and none of it
Pros: Ethnic diversity promoted there, and some good-natured people working there...

Cons: - Mentally prepare to see your hard work be destroyed by utterly incompetent local management, over and over again. - HQ leadership / mindset are very good, but often out of touch with what really goes on in this department. - Forget about career progression here, local management goal is to do as less as possible while getting away with it. If you oppose this mindset you will be targeted and gaslighted, they'll go far and wide to protect their little circle. - For these reasons this was by far the most toxic and depressing place I've personally ever worked, with reasonably crazy high turn-overs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You have been warned. That been said, my advice to you is: give it a shot and see how it goes, but always keep an opened mind and be ready to jump off.
Advice: Stop playing games or leave the chair to someone that knows what he's doing and he's willing to commit for the project and his team. Stop antagonizing HQ and talking behind their back, dumping on them the responsibility of your own failures. Stop the lies, manipulations and gatekeeping. Such behavior is not doing you any good, it promotes toxicity and ultimately will lead to your own downfall. Best of luck and farewell
Pros: - Interesting projects to work on - Good salary and benefits - Good name on your CV, but know what you're signing up for (see Cons)

Cons: Getting promoted is nearly impossible (there’s certain rules, like limiting the number of people to be promoted, etc). The salary increases, but not as much or as quickly as it should. Forced work from the office 3 times a week after work from home during covid had brought the company better results.
Advice: If there is a system to grade employees, but then you limit the amount of people that can be graded well (cause it implies promotion that is for only a few people), then it is not fair. People that do exceptional work are graded as “average” just because of this system. And there’s lots of very talented people in the AI team. Don’t force people to work from the office if they perform better working from somewhere else.
Pros: The jobs is very interesting most of the time, if you land good projects and have the initiative to take on challenging tasks. Lots of opportunities for development. Possibility of publishing papers at top NLP conferences. Great atmosphere. Brilliant engineers. Good benefits.

Cons: Following my internship experience, I've noticed a few cons associated with the company. These include limited opportunities for advancement, potential communication gaps between different departments, occasional heavy workload, and a lack of structured feedback during the internship. Additionally, the company's work processes could sometimes be inefficient, and there might be room for improvement in terms of diversity and inclusion efforts. It's important to note that these cons might vary based on individual experiences and perspectives.
Advice: None
Pros: After completing an internship at this company, I've identified several pros that make it stand out. The company offers valuable hands-on experience, a supportive and collaborative work environment, exposure to cutting-edge technologies, opportunities for skill development, and a strong emphasis on networking and professional growth. Additionally, the company's commitment to employee well-being and work-life balance is commendable, making it an appealing place to consider for future employment.

Hospital. Cafe. Haircut shop. Fitness center. Whatever for our daily life.

Cons: Samsung is the "big dog" in Korea, everyone wants to work there. It is a matter of honor to work there. So they work like slaves. They sleep at work under their desks as they are putting in 16 to 18 hr days regularly. If they get fired they won't easily get hired elsewhere. So they work incredibly hard and expect the same from everyone else. In Aus we have other options. What they do is not necessary. So they consider us lazy. I told them they are slaves. They hated me. They are 100% data-driven. It's not OK to hit 95% or even 105% you have to hit your target 100% every time. You get reviewed weekly, not monthly. If you can handle the stress it's fine. If not you won't last. If you can last though then other people know how tough Samsung is and you can get jobs easily elsewhere. They know you can handle.
