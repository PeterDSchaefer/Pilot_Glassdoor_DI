Cons: POLITICS, blocking promotions based on current requirement, salary does not compare (from what I have investigated), dictation, disrespect for staff and 'those not in the circle of influence', Inability to implement / make decisions. Buddy system of staff, no consequences for failure, no recognition for success. Clocking in and out system, time sheets monitored, no freedom without permission at every turn. Regardless of how hard you work / what you do / what you have done to get there - you are all treated - and mostly paid - the same.
Advice: Set feasible KPI's, that when met should be recognised and form a base for salary / base, take the time to talk to your staff and find out what they are doing, promotions should be based on merit and what can be proven - not whims.
Pros: The car, quarterly bonus, 13th cheque, job security, uniform saves.

Cons: While the company is still quite young and continuously developing itself, one can in some cases also notice still some minor areas that still require further development, especially with regards to certain process standards, which may sometimes cause some trouble in the daily life.
Advice: None
Pros: The work is interesting, challenging, one has the chance to push projects through, which one never could do in a headquarter location. One can receive a great level of experience and self-development within this company and is also being supported strongly with regards to further staff developments by HR.

Engineering is better for work life balance than Sales & Marketing
Advice: Plan capacity and ressources ; care about people! ; review internal processes
Pros: International Exposure, Strategic planing, Intelligent, very good position in China, great products, well suited for the market; good technologies.

Location is Beijing, China

Cons: 1- Incompetent management: The management skills of middle and top management are very poor. Firstly the managers do not understand how the software industry works and then do not have the inclination of learning how it works. The people management skills of most of these managers can be gauged from the fact that a four member team has seen 8 people leave(in 2 years time) because they couldn't work in the VW IS environment.


2-Management focus: The top managers hardly play any role in the success of the IT projects. Top/middle managers or project manager hardly come into picture.
One senior manager seemed to have just one role  - point out to people that "this door can't be used for exit", "you need to wear tie" "you are only working the normal working hours??"

3-work-life balance: It is a very clear message from managers that developers need to work more that the normal working hours(No, budget doesn't permit overtime). 
Their estimates are generally very very poor and people end up working on weekends.
To give you an idea of the estimates: For one project the development lead estimated 115 man days of effort however the total development effort was 500+ man days..that too when developers had to cut corners to get the minimum functionality delivered.

I don't think there was even a proper discussion on why the estimates were so wrong.

4-software development processes:
Agile?  -NO
Waterfall?- NO
adhoc? - yes
wierd? -yes
depends on the whims and fancy of managers? - NO (remember that managers do not come into picture at all)
depends on the whims and fancy of lead? - YES and NO (yes, the development process keeps changing on the whims and fancy of the lead, however as the lead has no control - developers can divert the process at will)

Does the process work? - Good question!!


5-more focus on lip service than performance: This organisation doesn't value performance. To be really valued, one needs to be close to either the lead or the manager and if so, then he can get away with murder.

6-Highly political environment: 99% of employees in this department are contractors, including lead and project manager. First focus of these people is to cover their ^**Â£% and think about the task in hand later.
It is a highly political environment. Good people keep leaving as they can't survive and the crappies keep accumulating.

7- Not learning from mistakes: The worst part is that the VW IS department is not learning from its mistakes. I could see the same mistakes being repeated over and over again.
Advice: Create a meritocracy
Value competence and performance
learn from your mistakes
get rid of the existing crap managers
