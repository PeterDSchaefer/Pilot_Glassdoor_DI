Advice: None
Pros: Very nice experience of working at Apple.

Cons: No cons that I can mention.
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible, good pay, good environment

Cons: Moving to IT support was awful. Micromanaging (was called in for walking around for 1-2 min every hour because you're expected to be sitting and taking calls your ENTIRE shift) and irate customers gave me anxiety to the point of daily anxiety attacks before my shift. When I reached out for help or to be moved to a chat role I was basically told I was SOL. Moving to IT and being given completely different responsibilities from the job I actually applied for decreased not just my morale but all my coworkers to the point where most of us quit because it was no longer worth it
Advice: Stop micromanaging and actually provide mental health support to ALL employees, not just your valuable engineers and designers. Bragging during regional meetings about not having to lay anyone off isn't the flex you think it is when half the team leaves voluntarily due to the poor conditions.

Cons: Apple is comprised of many teams and the orgs are hard to keep track of so it takes a long time to learn how to work cross functionally
Advice: None

Cons: Fully remote, so lacked onsite experiene. Very inexperienced manager who had not lead people before. Work is very segmented where they want you to follow a robotic script, process and minimal involvement in the creative process. Would not work there again.

Pros: Good energy, excitement, well-paid, overall organizational openess to explore, learn and grow.

Advice: None
Pros: Good pay for apple company

Cons: Limited growth for part time employees. They seem to reserve most advancement for full time employees committed to Apple for the foreseeable future.
Advice: Roles that allow for vertical growth would be really appreciated by the people not in full time roles.
Pros: Working at Apple is quite the experience. The energy is undeniable, the people at the retail level where I work are some of the best I've ever met. Everybody is so different but everyone possesses the same quality that they truly want to help. I've never been denied genuine assistance and they have maintained a proactive and safety first approach to COVID which I appreciate every day. 

I'm a part time employee while also being a full time student. They are tremendously supportive with college schedules and as long as your availability meets the needs of the business, the company is more than flexible. Apple knows I will not be with them beyond the next year or two but they continue to push me to accomplish all I can and invite me to be my true, best self every day. It's a terrific experience and if you get the opportunity I recommend giving it a shot.

Cons: Too many to list honestly.
Advice: None
Pros: Few if any and I wouldn't recommend.

Advice: None
Pros: Abilitiy and education to instill comfort within doing repairs on your own. you do have someone holding your hand. they provide you with training to gain proper confidence for any repair necessary.

Cons: Old vs New mentality. Very clear hierarchy according to tenure. There are few real problems but people complain about the smallest things. Gossip culture, difficult work-life balance. People seem to hate their lives. After months of thinking about it, a few other newbies agreed that it felt like high school. Possibly specific to the Austin office. Very little focus on maintaining a positive culture with depth. Shallow realtionships.
Advice: Challenge your own management and fight for things that will enrich the culture and create more connections with the teams. Free food/ events aren't cutting it.
Pros: versatile workspace (you can work all over the building, wherever you have access to), awesome lunch venue, excellent benefits, devices provided, understanding management

Cons: Difficult to move up. Always given vague feedback as to why you weren't promoted. There isn't a work/life balance. You're held accountable for other employee's mistakes. No weekends off. Always short staffed. Budgets for store use are very low which means you sometimes can't even get a new shirt.
Advice: Take care of your staff. They work hard, even when burnt out.
Pros: Health / Medical benefits are good

Cons: long hours with challenging work
Advice: None
Pros: Nice environment and good people

Cons: No guarantees of permanent employment after working for 4-5 months, recommendations to other stores are difficult to secure, difficult to communicate with store leaders after work hours due to insulation of communications (for good reason)
Advice: The hiring team is amazing, they really do pick the most "human" people (for lack of a better word in the retail sense) and it shows. I hear though that the quality differs from store to store, but the team at Victoria Gardens was a pleasure to work with. Getting back in after being let go feels like getting kicked out of heaven though.
Pros: Discounts on products and stocks, flexible schedule for FWE workers (Temp. Specialists), good starting pay, great training and development opportunities

Cons: no growth no advancement opportunities
Advice: give more pay when more work is done because there's no incentive to work as hard as possible when colleagues can get by slacking doing minimal work
Pros: get to meet some really nice people

Cons: The interview systems of situational-based experiences was honestly stupid. They would rate your answer based on an experience that you had and a lot fo people just learned how to play the game and answer the question (sometimes with something that didn't even happen to them) and they would get promoted over someone that actually deserved the job.
Advice: When I worked there my manager wouldn't allow me to go for different roles, even make lateral moves. I was a top seller at the store and had amazing sales stats. I wasn't allowed to get another leaders permission to apply and they had to do what he wanted for me because he was "my manager." But that really just meant he spent 30 minutes once every 8 weeks in a conversation with me, that made no sense at all.

Cons: I can’t really think of any
Advice: I don’t have any advice
Pros: You get an iPhone so

Cons: Schedule is brutal. Have to use vacation days sometimes just to get weekends off. Some favoritism/accommodations made for employees if they complain about their schedule enough which makes it harder and harder for everyone else just to get time off on the weekends or earlier shifts. Hard to see a long term career in retail management when schedule is so hard to get regular time off with kids or partner.
Advice: Please please please get rid of the Lead job and instead hire more managers. Or, assign the same priveleges to leads on top of comp (such as ability to work remote/vpn provisioning). Its hard to grow and network when the only time you are able to do this is in the store when you can access email/systems, etc, where you are expected to spend much of your time customer facing.
Pros: Great, I mean, GREAT benefits. Bump in RSU grants since you are apart of leadership. Really competitive hourly rate. Different types of sick or time away pay so that you only use sick time when you are really sick (other than with Covid-19)

Pros: stable company no layoffs till now

Cons: Two Companies. One Name.

Apple Retail is treated as a separate company even though it's not.
Leadership is concerned with profit, sales, and metrics.

The people don't matter even after the creation of the the "People" organization. Granted - in Apple Retail the leader of Retail is the People department - because that's where most of the employees are.
I'm sure life in Apple Corporate is hunky dory.

Cons for Benefits?
If you needed a vacation in the Retail arena? Boom - we ain't got time for that.
Local Leadership- Oh you don't like to sell things? Let's promote you to customer.
Advice: None
Pros: Pros on Benefits? Most benefits were outstanding. If you wanted a discount on a product? Boom - 25% off one item per grouping. If you wanted to adopt? Excellent, here's some money for that. If you had a transplant? Excellent, have some money for that. If you had health issues? Excellent, here's some time off for that.

Advice: None
Pros: Amazing company to work for with a-lot of benefits and great work life balance

Cons: Team culture is totally opposite to company culture. Very toxic team environment, never encouraged for cross training and change of responsibility.

People around you working on same things for more than 5 years. If you ask for change in responsibility or cross training manager would decline. Manager expect you to work on same thing every day. You would have no motivation lack of new responsibilities and challenges. 

Very micro managing by manager feels like you are working in store as an hourly employee so you have to answer for every minutes you worked on which task. You need to take permission from your manager for 1:1 with their managers.

You have to include your manager as an optional in all meetings you schedules with your stakeholders so your manager keep an eye on you.
Advice: Please do not make anyone as a manager if person does not qualify for manager without lack of leadership quality or vision. 

No matter how intelligent your employees are without good manager you will not see great result.

Advice: None
Pros: Good work culture. Hours are on demand

Cons: Wages are nowhere near covering the cost of living.
Higher management does not listen to employees. 
Food insecurity following low wages.
Management sells the vision of our roles being important and impacting people all over the world, yet expects us to live on feeling proud of our work, when it is money, not pride, that pays our bills.
Everyone is soon to be forced back to the office destroying any modicum of having real work/life balance.
CEO and his sycophants pride themselves in breaking barriers yet do not see that their employees are unhappy, that remote work helps in productivity, and would ultimately save the company money.
Advice: Remove Cook and his followers, replace them with someone who actually puts employees needs before investors, after all, it’s employees who create the value, not investors.

Cons: Can be tiring, wear out employees quickly
Advice: None
Pros: Great company, expects a lot from you

Cons: Compensation is a sore point for every single person on my team and for everyone I talk to on other teams. Business claims to pay the competitive market rate but as people leave in droves we learn they find much higher pay for similar roles across the board elsewhere in the same city. More and more outsourcing taking place to save on paying employees a living wage. A recent “generous” attempt to raise wages and appease people managed to go lower than total inflation this year so was effectively a pay decrease in terms of purchasing power for most people. 

HR plus the outsourced business that does all the paperwork seems to be designed to help Apple rather than the employee. Heard dozens of sad and frustrating first hand experiences from direct co workers about being ignored or made to fill out complex paperwork to het help. I’ve witnessed a few (but not all) managers being confrontational and unprofessional. The public image is far removed from the extremely negative vibe in office exacerbated by the snails pace that the business has in addressing any of this, often with people forgetting all about things before a resolution . 

Offices are colorless, lifeless, dystopian grey/white/silver with a splash of “art” of a phone or computer product here and there, so it makes a fairly miserable place to spend time in. Outside is much nicer but the heat is too much to be out there a lot and there is very limited shade for outdoor seating.

Inflexibility on work from home feels silly after doing it well for 2 years. No real rhyme or reason why some people get to work at home and others to not on the same team.
Advice: Treat employees like humans (not disposable robots), support them, and pay the real market rate. Have better ways to share feedback often from employee and really listen. Overhaul the office culture from top to bottom.
Pros: The stock plan is excellent and the campus services are top notch - medical / dental / gym / vision all on site. Restaurant used to serve great food at reasonable prices and might do again one day (was very reduced post-covid). 401 k match also solid. Facilities are modern and easy to navigate. Leave generous for US companies even if it’s a bit behind some direct competitors.

Cons: Very under staffed compared to demand of customers.
Advice: Help out and don't stand there when they get behind.
Pros: Good Benefits for the employees

Cons: -Overall direction of new leadership and management. Prioritization of metrics and statistics. Although these stats were always important (they are factored in to determine pay increases), I've noticed newer leadership change how they treat different employees over small changes or minor trends in sales metrics (Applecare,trade-in, accessories,connected).

-Work-life balance is not well for a full-time role. Hours are long and can be tedious, working long is expected and rewarded. For college students, I would've recommended a part time role, but even then the schedule inconsistency and still high commitment would only be for those who can effectively balance the two as equal. I was burnt out and ready for something new after about 2-1/2 years, many will stay for years, some decades.

-You are taught that the Apple experience is about doing what's right for the customer, within the boundaries of what's possible for the company. Often, even a straightforward and legitimate solution (the one our service guide recommends) involves jumping through many hoops to get the customer,leadership,and system to all agree. As a starting specialist, you are the professional hoops jumper, especially at the genius bar.

-Consistent issues with in-store software and hardware, internal tools and services going down, loss of written notes and repair details. Service blackouts are usually minutes but can sometimes last for hours. Daily re-write ups of unsaved repairs or broken repair chains. Extreme lack of production due to these problems, usually amplified by the higher amount of customers we saw at our smaller and less employed store.

Slight anti-union attitude, but no outright call against them. We saw other large stores in cities unionize, I know some of my fellow employees weren't opposed to the idea given the dissent from work-life balance.
Advice: -New management is treating many employees differently, doing favors for them or their customers, or prioritizing them for promotions based on sales statistics. This is something that was trending worse before I left. 

-Solutions are becoming more restrictive, higher cost, almost no room to work with customers and leadership. Often, we are just button pushers on an ipad.

-Recent high turnover at our GB and larger stores unionizing are proof apple retail has changed significantly since reopening post-lockdown.
Pros: -You will work with some fantastic and creative professionals, everyone is kind and very welcoming. The company culture is good, although it can be a bit corny or repetitive at times.

-Excellent benefits and free/discounted Apple services, products etc. Great coverage for insurance and family options available, lots of little company perks. Good stock options, RSUs, occasional bonuses. 

-Competitive/higher than average starting wages for retail space.

-Room to really grow and work your way up in the retail space. Getting promoted/role change is hard work but would pay off well for those looking to lead their team. Many options available for those looking for a career experience at the corporate level after being successful in your current role.

-Great loyalty to and from their employees, although sometimes this means we just 'do whatever corporate thinks we should'. During store closures amid the pandemic apple had all of us work our full hours remotely on collaboration and individual and group projects, great to see them take care of us like that compared to many other retail spaces.

-Genuine joy from helping others often at no cost (depending on hardware/software issue) and repairing trust in Apple's products and services. A personal passion of mine.

-Some new minor benefits and lower schedule requirements for employees coming soon (mostly in response to work life balance issues, see below).

Advice: None
Pros: Enjoyed the diversity and meeting new people.

Cons: - Poor management
- Proper raises were only ever considered after losing 2/3 of our team in under a year
- Being a giant corporation, resolutions to issues come at a trickle
Advice: Management should treat their staff with more (or, in some cases, any) respect. Employees have been told over and over that they aren’t good enough for leadership opportunities unless they move to other stores. Managers are continually demeaning to employees, using gaslighting tactics to try and squeeze anything extra from people eager to prove themselves and move up in a company most of us were excited and hopeful to work for. The least offensive trait I see from management on a regular basis is just laziness; constantly shoving employee needs onto other managers, or refusing to do overrides because we are supposed to be watching how many we do. Respect will go so much further than condescension.

I had to leave the company due to time off policy being changed for part time workers. I had a long trip that I notified management about years before it happened to avoid surprises –– yet, when the policy changed, I didn't find out about it until my time off requests were denied. Even then, I didn't get a straight answer about whether or not I could have the time off and my job when I come back until it was about too late, and then I was fed up.
Advice: Researching and communicating policy for your employees is extremely important in time-sensitive situations.
Pros: Benefits include good healthcare, incentives for health and wellness, free virtual counseling, stock options. Yearly raises were timely. Good company if you like being social. If you are a full time employee, there are programs to start you working at corporate if you wish, and more than a few of my fellow employees began corporate careers through this program.

Cons: i had not find them
Advice: non
Pros: everything was very very good

Cons: Micromanagement is definitely a major con
Advice: Trust your employees
Pros: Discounted product is a benefit

Cons: Non that come on mind with this company
Advice: None
Pros: Environment Culture Friendly Mentors Great experience

Cons: Politics within the buildings are annoying. If you aren't faking it until you make it, you will not get far. You need to absorb everything that management says in order to be considered for a promotion. If you don't, they will overlook you every time. For an atmosphere that emphasizes feedback, the same feedback that you dish out will come back to haunt you down the line.
Advice: It's very hard to work for a company that preaches diversity and inclusion, but having stores with "token" black managers. In a management team of 7-8, there's no reason for there to be one black person on the Leadership team.
Pros: This was a wonderful company to work for when I was looking for a job fresh out of college. The stock options are amazing and the health insurance is amazing. The pay is above normal for retail.
