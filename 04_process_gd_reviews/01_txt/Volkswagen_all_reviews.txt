Cons: Worst place for a Software Engineer to make any kind of career. Every single department is a disaster, ego tripping everywhere, everyone is trying to reach the end of the month to get their salaries for the next one. No one has any idea how to make software, they think that's like making a car, it doesn't work this way.

No one can't be fired, this is a nest of incompetence.
Advice: Fire incompetent people and take some time to make some reflection about yourselves. Whatever decision you are going to take soon, doing taking this in mind, do actual people have the competence to "Drive the future of mobility"? If not... fire them. This whole situation is contraproducent for the goals of the company, this many external companies... they's no accountability, ownership for anything we do, the daily job is reduced to a game of blaming others. It's just a big hierarchical structure, where everyone is blaming and fingerpointing each other for their mistakes instead of working as a team towards a common goal, this mindset percolates even in small departments and even amongst team members, or teams.
Pros: Stability, pension, the workers council will make sure to make you stay (although this is bad, as incompetent people will always stay)

Advice: None
Pros: team, support, management, culture, friends

Cons: it is not bad anytime
Advice: None
Pros: it is always good anytime

Cons: Not busy = means that it is really quite boring, and not just for my position either the sales team are equally as bored.

Where to start?
• Poor training, had no idea what was going on for the majority of my employment and therefore I didnt learn anything to help me develop any skills.
•Lack of communication between all the departments, leads to a lot of confusion
•Manager was way too passive aggressive 
•The Sales team were quite good at returning calls, however some members of the service team just dont care (I dont blame them) but the consequences are that customers get angry at le receptionist. (Which reminder, wasnt trained for)
•Diversity is probably good, the other employees had low key racist comments or discriminatory comments to certain races etc.

Additional meh things:
•The layout of the place made it very hard to see things and do my job
•Update employee areas please, the toilets were horrible, the kitchen was just grim and had very basic things, just a kettle actually
•You would think for a multi million or billion company they would provide more for the staff like lunch, better utilities, even caring and that's free
•Sick isnt paid which is just stupid 

Probably a lot more, but my experience is mine alone. I wouldn't recommend working here in the dealerships as they are quite boring, high pressure, confused management and bad work/life balance.
Advice: Be better.
Pros: Not a busy environment which is both a pro and con*

Cons: Will not be given any meaningful work or work at all. Most of the day in spent day dreaming. HR  and payroll is not transparent at all and attempts to conceal information from you. Extremely boring and worthless internship unless, you want to experience living in Japan. Almost all other interns will be people that major in  Asian Studies  with no knowledge on Business or Economics/the automotive industry. No "native" English speakers, most employees 98% of employees are either German or Japanese. So, if your Japanese is not very good, it will be a difficult experience. Toyohashi is an extremely boring part of Japan and if given the option, goto Tokyo. Although, your salary will not go very far in Tokyo. It will be 100% better than frequenting the same 3 bars that close at 11pm every weekend.
Advice: Don't needlessly hire interns. If there isn't a project or assignments for them, don't hire them.
Pros: Get to live in Japan
Respectful Colleges
Job offer likely with successful internship
No drug test
Paid(Most internships in Japan are unpaid or extremely low-paid compared)
They will find you housing if you work/live in Toyohashi.

Cons: No direction, hire and fire
Advice: None
Pros: Nice Colleagues to work with

Cons: Unfortunately i would say that the hiring policy is very strict and depends on your top managers if they heard about you. Work hard and might have a change to be rewarded, knowing that a recommendation from the top managment in Volkswagen group is worth a lot if you apoly somwhere else.
Advice: Keep up the good job and the management you are following. It not uncommon to meet the president of the company and naturally says hi to you because he trully value his employees from interns to top management.
Pros: As your managers are all seniors they are just an awesome source of knowledge and inspiration. I think the management used in Volkswagen by some managers is just brillant as they try to put you at the best of your performance. you will participate all the travels and most the car dealer network visits and these kind of things. Today I can say that I gained in maturity and changed a part of how I was working. Also the end of the months is an exciting moment to live in the automotive industry.

Cons: There are 20% old fashioned macho types which still have the old german mentality (from before 1979) which think women are below them. These discriminating bullies are still around, also destructive people from the old management culture, which brought the company to its knees, and with their attitude they destroy the team spirit and demotivate the surrounding team. When these people are managers, they are there for their own gain; they change the position a lot. Although there are also good ones who care for their employees.
Advice: Telling the press that the old culture is being changed, and making cool shows with famous people, doesn't change the fact, that the old culture is still there. Ensuring that the old-mentality managers do not get important positions would be one step ahead. It is not serious and makes no good impression to the outside world to make a top manager responsible for software engineering who has very little clue about software engineering.
Pros: Remote office work possible. Very family friendly. Most of colleagues in Germany are very good colleagues. Very strong workers' union.

Cons: You manage your career alone, and explore new opportunities under covert. The HR system doesn't work although they claim for 'best employer' program. Promotions are very rare. You are promoted from outside. From inside promotion doesn't work and you have to do lots of  politics.
Advice: Walk the talk and o objective review of career path and be honest about skills and potentials. If negative opinion on promotions then give true and objective guidance on how to improve, and make it part of the regular (quarterly( follow up. Check also with skip level meetings.
Pros: Different jobs, experiences, areas. Moving from one to another area is quite easy if you are a people person and skilled in what you do. Company has international and growing business. Opportunities may help you land on other parts of the planet if you want (and can).

Cons: POLITICS, blocking promotions based on current requirement, salary does not compare (from what I have investigated), dictation, disrespect for staff and 'those not in the circle of influence', Inability to implement / make decisions. Buddy system of staff, no consequences for failure, no recognition for success. Clocking in and out system, time sheets monitored, no freedom without permission at every turn. Regardless of how hard you work / what you do / what you have done to get there - you are all treated - and mostly paid - the same.
Advice: Set feasible KPI's, that when met should be recognised and form a base for salary / base, take the time to talk to your staff and find out what they are doing, promotions should be based on merit and what can be proven - not whims.
Pros: The car, quarterly bonus, 13th cheque, job security, uniform saves.

Cons: The company desperately wants to grow at all costs ....at all costs! The attitude is that anything is able to be overcome with money and that means all resources are funnelled into paying for discounting cars or pushing more and more equipment into them to make them appealing enough to overcome buyer resistance to issues that are surfacing about quality and reliability. Staff turnover is high in some departments due to very poor management.
Advice: Dont pretend to care about your customers or staff, actually care enough and respect that they are valuable. Selling more cars is not going to solve the problems in the brand or at the dealerships.
Pros: Really good products and people who are completely committed to the brand despite not all being well below the surface.
Good pay and conditions but terrible location.

Cons: Too much bureaucracy and controls slow down anything you have to do to cope with competition actions in the market.

Everything needs to be reported and decided in HQ in Germany. Germans don't believe in Brazilians knowledge of the market.

Excessive agreements with employee's unions does not let you dismiss bad employees, making the management even more hostage of a bad management situation than in similar companies.
Advice: You must fight the excess of meetings and implement a 360º evaluation of all management AND employees. The market is for the fast ones, not to the slow ones.

Try to dismount each department feud.

Try to not change the whole VP level every three years, because this leads the company to not face and solve long term problems.
Pros: Good bonus and new cars every year.

Cons: Bad communication from top to bottom
Management placed on a pedestal
Lack of career opportunities
Lack of career planning
Lack of responsibility for people on the floor
Lack of health and safety awareness
Advice: Volkswagen wants to implement Toyota concepts to their processes, but this can only be done once management is seen as part of the team and not placed on a pedestal. Look at Toyota's management concept. Communication needs to be improved from top to bottom and with people having more of a input in the day to day decisions.  People also need the opportunity for guidance for a career plan. Maybe spend as much time on their people as they do on their product's quality. People need to feel save and valued at work.
Pros: Good quality product
Pride in the product
Salaries are competitive
Good team spirit
Good quality equipment 
Up to date with technology

Cons: Like isolated region, top management seems arrogant for Local people, making business plans for his own career, selfishness. Connection between HQ and korea is not communicated very well, I don’t know why. We need secret inspectors to review all directors of NSC. They don’t see long term strategy but see short term plans for his personal career.
Advice: Because of your(top management) political arguments in Korea, local people are getting loose strong motivation to work and to see further actions. Hello VW HQ!! Please send us inspectors and re-check the organization. As long as I see, local people want to do for their future and everything. Please set this organization for more healthy and futuristic.
Pros: Usual benefit programs. Name value from brand power.

Cons: No true people managers, only target obsessed types with no knowledge of teams jobs, processes, or people's skills. V fast paced, overly complex processes and systems, cumbersome working practices, and the most over the top interview format for jobs that are all much of a muchness. Anyone would think they are carrying out vetting for CIA the length and gruelling nature of their interview processes - when they are generally all pretty similar admin jobs. 
Day job - expect to encounter old fashioned business processes, and expect a fierce blame culture.
Advice: Start recruiting true people mangers - with people skills.
Pros: Car ownership schemes are handy if you are without wheels.

Cons: To reach a higher positioin you must be german, mexicans and others take too long to reach a higher position because in my experience the CEO and the other chiefs are germans.They also make you work saturdays and sundays if necessary.
Advice: Try to get more points and really helpful courses for the especialist according they necessities but also they schedule.
Pros: You can find anyplace to work in your interest areas, they have really good benefits as some clothes cupons at sears and other stores also they help you to rent a car from the brand.

Cons: Some brands have a toxic work environment with a blame culture - no sense of team
Career progression is difficult, it all about timing
A lot of great employees are unmotivated 
There is a lot of internal politics, within the brands, and around the building
Advice: Listen to surveys carried out by employees. Keep staff motivated by setting defined projects, and potential career opportunities. Offer more flexible working hours, or potentially working from home one day a week.
Pros: Very friendly staff, everyone in the build is pleasant. Some brands more than others 
Great cars ownership scheme with access to cheap insurance
Great to learn about the industry quickly
Excellent pension &amp; health insurance options

Cons: Presenting a product to humans requires audacity and strategy, which can require enormous effort and investment.
Looking at the history of the world we realize that the simple is amazing, the detail is unique and exclusive.
Advice: Focus and value on employees is the largest requisition that a company.
Need high investment in experts and knowledge holders, are the soul of success!
Pros: Company Strong! Strong Values! It has the agility and the competence to launch in the world market, vehicles with high and excellent added value!
It has the tenacity of only with a single launch, have the power to create worldwide trends in technology and safety in vehicles around the world!

Cons: 1. There is lot of politics and favorism especially in interior and exterior department.
2. People are not open to teach you systems and process,they will try to prove that only they are masters and no one world is better than them.typically Bhosari MIDC people who got hired by there relatives or friends.
3. HR and management do not have any control over such attitude people.no ethics at all at work.
4. Work quality is nothing just act like postman between supplier and Skoda or VW headquarters.
5. No work life balance at all, buses reaches 7:00 am to office you will have to start 1 hour before at-least from home if you are living well within city.
6. Increment is just 5-6 % each year.
Advice: No advice as they are never in mood of listening
Pros: No as such apart from global level systems acess

Cons: While the company is still quite young and continuously developing itself, one can in some cases also notice still some minor areas that still require further development, especially with regards to certain process standards, which may sometimes cause some trouble in the daily life.
Advice: None
Pros: The work is interesting, challenging, one has the chance to push projects through, which one never could do in a headquarter location. One can receive a great level of experience and self-development within this company and is also being supported strongly with regards to further staff developments by HR.

Cons: Insufficient management diversity, need for higher  comercial and sales orientation, not strong enough in marketing, poor performance in USA market, strugglingh with SEAT, very high fixed costs, too many number of Brands
Advice: More orientation to customer experience, more focus in marketing, review of structural costs, skip Brands with insufficient performance, more diversity in management including more nacionalities apart from German
Pros: Many successfull brands in the group, great product development, worlwide sales leader, extremely high market share in Europe, Latam and China, good geographic balance, outstanding financial results, high stock market capitalization

Cons: - Soooooo slow (partly due to labor union)
- Everything is politics
- No transparency in many things
- Hard to climb the ranks, lot of old managers
- Toxic culture with a lot of silos
Advice: - Fire at least 10% of management, top managers below board level should only have limited contracts for 5 years
- Get middle management to give the big picture to employees
- Give consequences for not reaching targets
- Don't get to influenced by labor union (it is a mafia)
Pros: - Excellent salary
- Gigantic company with lots of international opportunities
- Good for petrol heads and traditional engineering

Cons: Decision are taken not due to content reasons or necessity, but purely out of political reasons
Save your back attitude overtakes taking any risks
Lacks behind in digitalization efforts
Hard to drive any changes
Learning curve from errors is less steep than at many other places
Advice: Break up the clusters of people just promoting themselves
Create an atmosphere where creating value comes first
Motivate managers to take more risks  and decisions (even if it means that an error can happen)
Pros: Large company with many career possibilities
Well-respected and known company name
Good place to create a network
Good work-life balance, good salaries

Cons: The same exposure to customers many times makes urgencies more important than really important things and you have to work on demand rather than following a plan.
Advice: IT Services should have more considerations from a management perspective since it´s a really customer facing job and it´s how customers perceive how IT works for them and what IT do for them.
Pros: It´s a very challenging career with lots of opportunities to shine and exposure of your job duties to internal  clients, most of them VIPs. Really customer oriented position,

Cons: Unfortunately they have a big problem with blame culture, people spend a lot of time trying to cover themselves instead of collaborate or work . The company is slightly behind compared to other large corporations, no working from home or flexibility culture. It’s up to the managers to decide how their team work. Some perceive that as too modern.
Advice: Let’s move to the 21st century, listen to the employees’ feedback.  I think you are trying but there is much more to do.
Pros: Fantastic car scheme, excellent professionals.

Cons: - No natural progression, apply for promotion. They give the impression they care about your development but really they care about very few.
- MK location
Advice: To care more about your employees, and focus on not blindsiding them with new plans. They are also toxic people in the business who management should be dealing with better.
Pros: There is a good Company Car Scheme, you get a new car for family and friends every 6 months. It is a good workplace where you work with intelligent colleagues.

Cons: Terrible development
Awful HR
Management promise jobs to people before they are on the advertised wasting others time at interview
IF your face fits you will be fine, or a woman who entertains her male "boss"
Advice: Managing Directors need to watch the management below them as they truly are running a muck!
Pros: The only positive of this coming are the benefits such as onsite physio, but they use these benefits to cover up the fact they are terrible employers.

Cons: The main challenge I found with Volkswagen Ireland was the poor pay and the huge pay gap.  We were rewarded as staff with good car purchase opportunities but money is not evenly distributed.
Advice: Cut high paid surplus staff and employ younger, vibrant and innovative staff
Pros: Flexible, trusting, innovative and rewarding environment, a place to learn full scope of a business. The management are nurturing and look out for and understand every individuals personal circumstances

Cons: Working hours 7 days a week
Block rooms to work, don't have fire extinguishers for safety
Dull environment
Seats are not comfortable for staff
Not fair chance to put your point in front of seniors
Advice: Keep a core knowledge of dealerships, what they are doing, the staff review survey, the safety measures of showroom premises

Your seniors level management comes every month, eat &amp; drink highest price food but no one ever bother about staff security measures to fight from unexplained disasters
Pros: Supportive Staff, Cleanliness, Facilities availability

Cons: Few opportunities of promotion. Men have advantage over women. As they have more employees than needed and no threats in the company, some professionals do not contribute while others work hard.
Advice: None
Pros: Stable company in a still growing market in LA, it is not a company who threats the employees. More associates in Brazil than needed, the work is not ver hard to everybody. Good salaries and defined time work. Invest in Marketing and Advertising.

Pros: -A subsidiary of an Ayala company

Advice: Be more open towards new ideas.

Cons: In some departments you are seen purely as a mean to get work done. Most often the human aspect is set aside.
Advice: Praising to maintain a policy of equality doesn't just mean stating it on you websites, it also means internalizing and incorporating it to all departments and devisions.
Pros: Great salary and unbeatable working hours. The work live balance is will not be harmed, except if it comes to three shift work.

Cons: everyone is only in charge of small area of the whole department, if you want to study more, it's better to choose a small compay;need more balance between job and life
Advice: need to hire more staff and pay more in order to decrease its turnover rate
Pros: they have great training programs provided every year depends on your job and interest. 
great lunch offered every day

Pros: Highly compfortable work environment. Little performance controls and checks. Job security and highly stable environment to work for. Easy access to cheap cars.

Cons: Some poor managers when 25 salesman leave in a year it's not the staff at fault it's the sales manager. A lot of good people lost because on one persons failings.
Advice: Promote from within somebody who know and likes the brand and knows how to manage and motivate people not stress and de motivate them.
Pros: Excellent product, large customer following, fantastic buildings to work in, good training

Cons: It is purely people driven organisation. 
There is huge discrimination between salaries of employees of similar grade or position. Favouritism is quite prevailing. 
No standards to merit employee's performance. 
Processes of appraisal are just for sake, nobody follows it. 
Management does not take care of performers.
Advice: .
Pros: Good work-life balance is maintained. 
Nice pay packages are offered. 
Nice working atmosphere. 
Employee benefits are good. 
Employee feels no burden.

Cons: 1- Incompetent management: The management skills of middle and top management are very poor. Firstly the managers do not understand how the software industry works and then do not have the inclination of learning how it works. The people management skills of most of these managers can be gauged from the fact that a four member team has seen 8 people leave(in 2 years time) because they couldn't work in the VW IS environment.


2-Management focus: The top managers hardly play any role in the success of the IT projects. Top/middle managers or project manager hardly come into picture.
One senior manager seemed to have just one role  - point out to people that "this door can't be used for exit", "you need to wear tie" "you are only working the normal working hours??"

3-work-life balance: It is a very clear message from managers that developers need to work more that the normal working hours(No, budget doesn't permit overtime). 
Their estimates are generally very very poor and people end up working on weekends.
To give you an idea of the estimates: For one project the development lead estimated 115 man days of effort however the total development effort was 500+ man days..that too when developers had to cut corners to get the minimum functionality delivered.

I don't think there was even a proper discussion on why the estimates were so wrong.

4-software development processes:
Agile?  -NO
Waterfall?- NO
adhoc? - yes
wierd? -yes
depends on the whims and fancy of managers? - NO (remember that managers do not come into picture at all)
depends on the whims and fancy of lead? - YES and NO (yes, the development process keeps changing on the whims and fancy of the lead, however as the lead has no control - developers can divert the process at will)

Does the process work? - Good question!!


5-more focus on lip service than performance: This organisation doesn't value performance. To be really valued, one needs to be close to either the lead or the manager and if so, then he can get away with murder.

6-Highly political environment: 99% of employees in this department are contractors, including lead and project manager. First focus of these people is to cover their ^**£% and think about the task in hand later.
It is a highly political environment. Good people keep leaving as they can't survive and the crappies keep accumulating.

7- Not learning from mistakes: The worst part is that the VW IS department is not learning from its mistakes. I could see the same mistakes being repeated over and over again.
Advice: Create a meritocracy
Value competence and performance
learn from your mistakes
get rid of the existing crap managers
Managers need to play a part to see success in IT projects.
Concentrate on process
Pros: Brand name is the attractive feature

Cons: Bureaucratic, too much emphasis placed on processes, although employee car ownership scheme is an exceptional benefit you aren't always guaranteed the vehicle you want yet you must still pay the same amount. Also employees on starting salaries must pay the same as Directors for their vehicles
Advice: None
Pros: Great atmosphere, amazing benefits, opportunities to move around the brands and functions, iconic brands and talented colleagues

Cons: The Mangement has no vision at all. Promotions are more based on coffee talk than performance and knowledge. You have to be "visible" was often heard. It is part of the game but if those people take the leaed it is understandable why the company falls behind in new technologies
Advice: Change your culture and allow innovation
Pros: Work-Life-Balance

35h working week and 30d vacation are very good for someone who enjoys freedom.

Cons: Slow growth opportunities. Lack of good projects. No go ahead without approval from VW AG; this slows down the process. Lack of innovative ideas and thinking
Advice: Build your R&D in India and reduce dependence on Germany. Invest in better marketing to improve share in India
Pros: Good culture. SOP and systems in place. Good opportunity to work with cross functional teams. 
Good transport and food service

Cons: There are some pockets of management that do not follow company values and frankly, should not be there. Beware of the occasional snake.
Advice: Find dissenters and remove them to retain the best people.
Pros: I worked at VWG UK for nearly 5 years. Most people I came across were friendly, helpful and competent. Overall my experience of the company was a positive one. Good benefits.

Cons: Very poorly run, extremely unorganised, to few staff to do the job properly,shocking management as all they want to do is “hit with a stick” to get results and tick the VW boxes, bullying of some weaker staff is common place hence the revolving door, selling cars seems to be an after thought
Advice: Look after your staff properly and they will look after you and your company and make it a good place to work thus creating continuity with staff not wanting to leave all the time
Pros: The earning potential is quite good with a great quality VW brand

Cons: Volkswagen is a place where they try to create rules to make work efficient and fair for everyone, but the truth is these rules are only applied to certain people.

For example, there is a rule that 2 people with the same education and work experience should not be paid differently. 

There is another rule that sets payment levels (tariff groups) for people based on experience and education.

There is a third "rule" not written anywhere but enforced by HR when they find convenient that says people cannot be promoted more than 2 tariffs up.

Sounds all fair, but now, if you told HR that you were getting a salary of X which happens to be way lower than you would get at VW with the same experience and education. They will offer you less than they should, you accept, fair enough, not their fault you don't know better.

You get hired, you are already making less money than people with the same education and experience and thus there is a rule being broken. Then you ask for a raise to put yourself on the same levels of your colleagues, they say no because you can't be "promoted" many tariffs like that. But it is not a promotion as according to the tariff group that is exactly what you should be paid in the first place.

Would be great if would stop there. Let's say you have a friend in high places at Volkswagen and you don't have the education nor the experience to ask for a high salary. Still, you ask for a category (salary) that is meant for someone with at least 6 years more experience than you have. In general, HR would say no to this kind of request but as you came from internal and very important recommendation you get the salary that is not meant for you.

Now you are breaking 2 rules, where you make more money than people more experience and having a category not meant for you, just because of nepotism.

To make things even worse, Volkswagen pays way less to women than men.
Advice: Managemen at Volkswagen is the reason why the company is such much behind innovation. Old managers, with old mentality and old ways of doing business and managing.
Pros: Good name on your CV and not much pressure. If you are the kind of person that doesn’t care about your work, that is the place for you. If you do care about doing something meaningful, that is unlikely the place.
