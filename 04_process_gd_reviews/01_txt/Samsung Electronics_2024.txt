Cons: High Pressure: The fast-paced and competitive nature of the tech industry at Samsung Electronics can be quite demanding. The high expectations and tight deadlines sometimes led to a stressful work environment.

Work-Life Balance: Due to the demanding nature of the job, maintaining a work-life balance was challenging at times. Long working hours were often required to meet project deadlines and achieve goals.

Organizational Hierarchy: The company's large size and complex organizational structure sometimes made decision-making processes slow. Navigating through the hierarchy to implement changes or get approvals could be time-consuming.

Job Security: As with many large corporations, job security can be an issue due to the constant drive for innovation and restructuring. This uncertainty can be a source of concern for employees.
Advice: None
Pros: Innovative Projects: Working at Samsung Electronics provided the opportunity to be involved in cutting-edge technology and innovative projects. This exposure allowed me to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and gain valuable experience in a highly competitive field.

Professional Growth: The company offers a dynamic and challenging environment that promotes continuous learning and professional development. The emphasis on excellence and quality helped me enhance my skills and grow in my career.

Global Impact: Samsung Electronics is a global leader in the tech industry, and being part of this organization allowed me to contribute to products that have a significant impact worldwide. This experience was both rewarding and inspiring.

Collaborative Culture: The work environment at Samsung encourages collaboration and teamwork. I had the chance to work with talented and skilled professionals from diverse backgrounds, which enriched my professional experience.

Cons: This review considate a few common feedback by peers who left. The department is toxic due to the head (G****l). 
Scolding, gaslighting is a norm.
Top management tried to prohibit such behavior, but ended up only moving occurrence from public to slightly secluded area.

Poor career path as higher position normally held by korean. 

The subsidiary culture is inclined to pleasing management to HQ. New project launch each year just for the sake of reporting and KPI. management will highly focus on the project when it is 'seen' by HQ. Previous in progress projects will be neglected, and the person who handles the project will suffer. 

As I didn't work in another department, these comments are only applicable to innovation teams in SME .But the turnover is high as a whole subsidiary.
Advice: Look into high turnover department, give proper training for the head, or assign someone who are actually capable.
Pros: Good colleague. But most of them left.

Cons: - Terrible local management. Yelling, screaming and passive aggression are normal and to be expected. 
- Micromanagement is a standard. You should do what you are told to do, but when that does not work - it’s your fault.
- All the rumors about local Samsung are true.
- Aside from bonuses, you get no benefits. You have to pay participation for health insurance, and there is nothing else. 
- I’m not sure if anyone used their vacations days (bare minimum of 20), you should be grateful you are using any at all.
Advice: Advice is for HR to do their job. It is unbelievable how the bounce rate in some teams is super high and no one is doing anything.
Pros: - Bonuses 
- Big system, you can learn how everything functions
- There are some great people, unfortunately suffering in this work culture

Night Shifts

Advice: None
Pros: It is good to be here

Cons: One of the most toxic cultures I worked in. Colleagues and managers were emotionally burnt out, which was very draining. Bad and toxic behaviours are tolerated, especially from high management. I have seen countless people having to take sick leave from being over-worked.
The main issue is cultural, which comes from the Head Quarters in Korea. Their priority is NOT people or employees, even if they state it in their company values. All they care is about financial results, and squeezing every inch of blood and energy someone has to give. Additionally, there's no diversity at all. 90% of senior leaders are male, either Korean or white. This doesn't improve much in mid-management.
Don't be fooled by the name or by a high paycheck, and avoid yourself hours of therapy, anxiety and bad health. Stay away from Samsung.

Cons: **Review: Avoid This Company**

Working at this company has been a frustrating and stressful experience. The direction changes every week, leading to confusion and a lack of clear goals. The high-pressure environment makes it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Moreover, the Korean boss is extremely bossy and often micromanages tasks, which adds to the already tense atmosphere. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a stable and supportive work environment.
