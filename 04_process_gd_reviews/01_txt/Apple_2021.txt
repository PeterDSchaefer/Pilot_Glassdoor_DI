Cons: Holiday season, like any retail place, gets super hectic. Management might become concerned if you aren't involved socially with your coworkers.

I had to leave the company due to time off policy being changed for part time workers. I had a long trip that I notified management about years before it happened to avoid surprises –– yet, when the policy changed, I didn't find out about it until my time off requests were denied. Even then, I didn't get a straight answer about whether or not I could have the time off and my job when I come back until it was about too late, and then I was fed up.
Advice: Researching and communicating policy for your employees is extremely important in time-sensitive situations.
Pros: Benefits include good healthcare, incentives for health and wellness, free virtual counseling, stock options. Yearly raises were timely. Good company if you like being social. If you are a full time employee, there are programs to start you working at corporate if you wish, and more than a few of my fellow employees began corporate careers through this program.
