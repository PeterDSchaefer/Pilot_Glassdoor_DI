Cons: Some of the software systems used internally can be annoying. But nothing of complaint with workload or management.
Advice: None
Pros: Truly love working for Roche. They really know how to take care of their people.

Cons: To grow within the company you have to be willing to move to other areas of the business and to relocate.
Advice: None
Pros: Company culture, growth opportunities, compensation and benefits, and great leadership profiles.

Cons: With being such a large company, innovations won't happen as quick as with other companies. Many checks and balances
Advice: None
Pros: A great company and culture to work for. Really value work/life balance and everyone is happy to help each other.

Cons: - constant re-orgs, and there's never a well thought out plan, so the people at the bottom are constantly being thrown into chaos
- the quality of the leadership team decreases with each re-org; leaders are chosen based on favoritism, not on knowledge or skills
- leaders have no commitment to patients or quality, they only care about lining their pockets
- training sucks
- people who actually care and try to make improvements are labeled complainers and are not given opportunities to advance, or they're laid off
- hypocrisy, lies, gaslighting, double standards
Advice: you keep repeating "transparency, respect and fairness" in all the town halls, but actions speak louder than words
Pros: - good benefits
- some really amazing coworkers (until they get laid off)

Cons: Hard to learn the business because it’s so large
Advice: None
Pros: Great people
Great benefits
Hybrid work

Cons: Work/Life balance is strained for field employees
Advice: None
Pros: Compensation, Vacation time, premium healthcare

Cons: - Professional development is LACKING. They’ll tell you that there are plenty of opportunities to cross train, or that you can speak to your manager about taking on new responsibilities. Your average manager (with the exception of an amazing few) is not going to give up the resource that you are unless they are absolutely forced too. You will not get that opportunity because they can’t make it work. And you won’t get anymore responsibility because that’s how they make themselves look good.
- Speaking of managers, most of them don’t care about you in the slightest. Some of them actively despise you. One of the higher ups even joked and giggled when mentioning some layoffs we had gone through about 4 months prior. Sickening behavior.
- The planners for this site aren’t the best. Forgetting to put things on a schedule is one thing. Doing it literally multiple times a month and making everyone rush to figure it out is another.
- While most people here just want to get through the work day and go home, some of them want to make your day as difficult as possible. They will usually ruin it for the others.
Advice: It’s one thing to try to use as little labor as possible for efficiency sake. It’s another to actively gut a department (or multiple) by 20-40% in one fell swoop and then expect them to produce as much or more. We shouldn’t have to beg you for help.
Also, sometimes I’m sick. Sometimes an employee has to go become a dad for the first time and needs to take paternity leave. Sometimes someone gets hurt and needs to be out a few weeks. Those aren’t metrics. That’s just life and it shouldn’t be used against us as much as it is. It almost feels like you hate us sometimes, but I know better than that. To hate something you need to care about it. And the last few years have made it clear you don’t care about your employees anywhere near as much as you tell us, if at all.
Pros: - Pay is good and benefits are great.
- Most of the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful when an issue arises or a mistake is made. If there’s anything you want to learn about this industry, you’re going to be learning it from them, so get to know them.
- Very little work to take home with you if you aren’t a supervisor/manager.

Pros: Good company culture and growth mindset

Cons: Recent transformations and organizational structure changes have not always seemed logical and have created an environment of instability, which negatively affects morale

Cons: travel can be a lot at times
Advice: None
Pros: Great Culture and Team mates

Cons: Large organization so there can be a lot of red tape and difficulty with communication. Management can be rather opaque.
Advice: Clearer communication and a more forthright approach. Do not spare the details - we're all grownups, and we can handle negative things when they arise.
Pros: Excellent benefits, phenomenal colleagues, great culture, impactful and meaningful work

Cons: Many long-time employees and leaders lack the drive and passion to do great work. They have become comfortable and complacent.

Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work but highly dependent on your location and manager

Cons: High pressure, tight deadlines, long hours
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and upward mobility at this site

Cons: My manager was a Shared Services manager with no concept of IT or Security so she was not able to give me the support I needed to understand and collaborate on my role responsibilities. As a result, she managed based on meaningless tasks and how many hours she could get me to spend on them. She didn't understand that 10+ programs was too many for 1 person to fully understand, and maintain. Security was not centralized within the company so different departments were doing different things with no collaboration. Security was not taken seriously. Managers wanted to do the least and have me sign off on whatever. I had numerous privacy concerns that were part of their minimum security requirements that were not addressed. The company hasn't adopted a framework they plan to stick to. Overall, I felt like the fall person for when they eventually have a major breach or fall out with some privacy law like GDPR.
Advice: Centralize your security efforts and adopt a framework like ISO 27001 that will hold each program to security standards and provide value to your customers. Do not have  people who have never been technical, manage technical and security people. 
Pros: The benefits were awesome. I used the maternity leave and I really appreciated being out for 12 weeks instead of the traditional 6 weeks. I'm guessing this is because they are not a U.S. originated company. I also had the opportunity to work with really smart people.

Pros: Great benefits and flexible work hours
Rewarding work resulting in improved patient care

Cons: The work culture has gone downhill since Ventana was purchased. It is a strong "hustle" culture, where everyone views you either as a threat or someone to step on to get ahead. It can be quite toxic if you do not immediately fit in.
Advice: Pay your people! My role had lost 2 employees less than 2 months apart, and I got pushed into the role with less pay.
Pros: The benefits are great, really nice PTO accommodations.

Advice: None
Pros: Great environment, great people, good life-work balance

Cons: The company's management exhibits a distressing lack of concern for the well-being of its employees, particularly those of Indian origin. The appalling treatment meted out is indicative of a deeply troubling workplace culture.

Poland seems to top the charts as the most challenging country for fostering meaningful conversations. The overall lack of consideration and respect for people's opinions makes it a formidable contender in the race for the worst communication environment.

A disturbing trend of disregard for individuals is pervasive within the company. The absence of respect for employees not only tarnishes the workplace atmosphere but also undermines the fundamental principles of a healthy and productive work environment.

The recent focus on cost-cutting initiatives within the company has had severe consequences for its workforce. Stripping employees of their perks and slashing appraisal amounts not only jeopardizes their morale but raises questions about the company's commitment to fostering a supportive and rewarding professional journey.

The company's approach to cost-cutting reveals a concerning shift in priorities. Prioritizing infrastructure over employee well-being suggests a misplaced focus that may have long-term implications on the company's overall success and reputation.

The prevalence of broken promises within the company is disheartening. The practice of enticing new employees with false assurances rather than nurturing and promoting internal talent creates an environment of mistrust and undermines the potential for organic growth within the organization.
Advice: Promote a culture of inclusivity and respect by valuing individuals from diverse backgrounds. Encourage open communication and ensure fair treatment for all employees, fostering a positive and inclusive work environment.
Pros: A competitive salary and streamlined top management, specifically those positioned above the chapter lead.

Cons: Job stability
Restructuring often
Job clarity
Advice: None
Pros: Good one. 
Good package
Nice team
Cluster based approach

Cons: So I worked in the new Services and Solutions Division. Even though promoting itself as new - it works on very outdated principles. Old fashioned, corporate legacy, too many project managers, too many unskilled people, unnecessary hierarchy, higher ups have no idea what they are doing. Innovation is not really a thing, even though that is one of the Roche main taglines. No push for the newest and latest tools. Long hours. Slow, ineffective, unnecessary solutions. Building ultra expensive offices just for the ''clout'', even though no one is gonna be there. At the same time - not providing equipment, like powerful laptops/workstations for effective work to do animation and video editing. Using G-drive - to save all of the work - like really? Overall - just slow on making any change.
Advice: You will figure it out eventually, but years will pass.
Pros: Nice people, some sort of a security, pay is ok, health insurance is good

Cons: Not available. Roche is a good company
Advice: None
Pros: Great products. Good pay and excellent benefits.

Cons: You need to actively seek for projects to help you grow in your field.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work-life balance is a great advantage.

Cons: Being such a great company the expectations are very high and you need to perform at your best level, this means that you feel pressure at times.
Advice: None
Pros: Roche is a great company to work for, it rewards it employees through so many benefits and it gives the opportunity for people to develop.

Cons: And the con is, that they will help you change of department, if you are someone expendable. If you become a key member of the team, they won't let you change departments easily, or even be promoted. Unless you mantain the same tasks as in your previous role.
Advice: To pay attention to this con that I've just written. I know many talented and dedicated people that left the company due to this, while other fellow colleagues were promoted because they were killing the SLA's of the team. 
Pros: Good salary, compared to most of the IT companies in the city.
The IT support provided is to the company itself.
Nice benefits.
Possible international relocation.
Possibility of changing department. Although it comes with a con.

Cons: Very frequently reorg and cut people
Advice: None
Pros: Good branding in healthcare industry

Cons: Senior Leadership: Like all big companies, upper management is very corporate. A lot of changes that seemingly make no sense besides boosting the stock price (and consequently, their pay checks)
- Time: it's big, there's a lot of hand-offs that happen, and things just move slowly. It took 4 times as long to get access to certain data than we expected because of all of the people/organizations that needed to be involved
Career Growth: Roche had a lot of reorgs and it's not mainly flat, so it's hard to progress in your role.
Advice: None
Pros: People/Culture: I've worked on a few different teams and I've had overwhelming positive experiences
Benefits: Decent health and dental, and I like the extra they give to put into a health/personal spending account
Compensation: It's average to above average. Nothing too crazy, but it's often above industry average.

Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, work life balance

Cons: - Lack of growth opportunities
Advice: None
Pros: - Work-life balance
- Great benefits
- Inclusive culture
- Growing business model

Cons: Sometimes it can be hard to navigate all the different areas within the company.
Advice: None
Pros: There is a lot of autonomy in picking projects and the company is super conducive to networking

Cons: 1. Leadership diversity - Obvious and known to the Informatics KL community is that there is imbalanced in the ratio of Informatics "leaders" in KL. Most of the leadership members were from the same org (before transformation). This brings about question by many people is that why is this happening? Clearly there is favoritisms. Selections were bias and will still be unless something is done to fix it. In addition, most of the "leaders" selected to be the "core" team came from the same old org. 

2. Leadership authenticity - While there are some authentic KL Informatics leaders who has gone through the transformation storm, they remain authentic and with humility. However majority are not authentic, they rather play the "politically correct" game than to be true and authentic. I think this is due to the nature of how this KL site is being groomed and driven. Now it has become a norm. Psychological safety though is being promoted in the global level, is not practice and cultivated over here.

3. Leadership inclusivity: You will see some team members are being informed for some important matters but some were deliberately left out. This could be due to point number 1 above. When there is no diversity, inclusivity gets diluted. Most recent example that the Informatics KL community clearly observed and one that is also chronic for the past 1 year, is the different ways of working between the business domain and foundational domain. While the representative for business domain product manager informed, involves everyone and promote inclusivity, the foundational domain product manager only informs and involves those in her small circle or do it by herself. It is obvious this is done to fish for credit for ownself or just afraid of others getting the credit. This reflects very bad as a whole.

4. Bureaucracy and complicated process: For some tasks and project deliveries it take ages. Sometimes you can't make decision because you need to wait for someone. And because of this the business look elsewhere and even look for other IT teams within RSS (outside Informatics) for products and services.
Advice: Relook into Informatics KL site leadership team diversity and inclusion.  I don't think the KL site leaders will be able to change this themselves, this require a full People &amp; Culture (P&amp;C) review.  Perhaps also engaged an external consultant or a Global P&amp;C.
Pros: 1. Office: Office environment is conducive, nothing to shout about as there are better ones out there.

2. Squad assignments: Ample work as the company is huge. Project delivery work is interesting as you get to deal with many areas of the organization and learn more about the business (but with caveats, see under Cons). You get to run your scrums, checkpoints and manage expectations. Once you finish your assignment you can join another squad. It also boils down if you have good people leader.

Cons: mgmt decisions often do not consider people's actual assignments which cause blocking major project deliverables
Advice: None
Pros: good org culture, diverse teams, good benefits

Cons: It is not easy to recognize
Advice: None
Pros: There is a chance to develop within a company

Cons: As someone who is customer facing and in a sales role, lack of training when first stepping in to the company is concerning and unusual in this line of work and industry. If you dont know well your own product how do you expect yourself to convince others or (customers!) to buy your product/idea?
Advice: None
Pros: An established company with established quality of solutions &amp; products that basically sells itself, buying you enough time to retain/gain customers trust especially as a newbie with lack of training wtsoever. Building good rapport and taking care of the business operations of customers would at least buy you enough time to succeed in the beginning

Cons: Do not join Informatics. Work environment is getting toxic after the Informatics transformation in the end of 2022, and throughout 2023. You see groups of "camps" with own cronies, and then within the camps there will be sub group of cronies. Backstabbing and bad mouth is rampant behind the scene especially by this small crony, you come across some narcistic ppl who will go all extend to badmouth own team member and others so as to gain "power" and popularity. Knowing Tamil will be an advantage as you will be able to understand the bad things and lies that are been said.
Hiring and firing is based on favouritism. Most of the so-called KL leaders are fake and bias, only a few, like 4-5 out of the 20 plus are considered genuine and humble leaders.

Cons: Roche has been undergoing endless, exhausting transitions with no retention strategy. In my department, management has been ignoring the clear signs that top talent is unhappy and halfway out the door. Colleagues discuss their job hunts in the office. Workload is out of control with no new headcount in sight. Personal development and side projects have been on halt for a year while we work out our "temporary" resource issues. The only way to grow is to leave.

Pros: Roche Diagnostics: Good values at the core, patient focused and some people leaders were great!

Cons: -N/A in my opinion, not meaning that there are no challenges to handle and accommodate to, but it's all about adapting to changes, having an open mindset, and being able to raise a hand when something is wrong, I feel that management is always willing to hear, adjust, help, inform.

Pros: One of the best pharma companies

Cons: - The company mandates 2 days on average in the office. Effectively a burden for anyone who does not live in the Hertfordshire area or Northwest London. 

- The company uses badge swipe data to measure how often a person has been in the office. If this is below average, then disciplinary action may follow. This feels outdated and creates a culture lacking trust, and an uninclusive environment. 

- There's zero allowance to work from abroad. This is unfortunate if you are not from the UK and have family and relatives abroad.

- Permanent work from home is not an option unless in extreme circumstances.

- The overall 25 days of annual leave is a statutory minimum and other companies I have been working for had usually higher amounts. This is especially low considering how inflexible is the remote working policy.

- The HR or People and Culture are nonexistent on the site and barely visible. They do not gather employee feedback and do not work efficiently to update policies in time. 

- The upper management and head of the site are detached from the real work the employees are doing and do not trust that they can perform effectively even outside the office.

- The company and head of site rely on blanket policies (e.g. 2-day mandate, etc.) instead of trusting line managers to find effective solutions with employees that fit the business needs and align with company values. 

- The career progression seems slower than in other industries and somewhat difficult to predict.
Advice: Trust your employees that they wish to do the best work possible and stop exercising control over people. 

Stop comparing pre- and post-COVID data and start thinking about how a modern organisation operates. Plenty of workplaces operate effectively without resorting to uninclusive policies such as mandated days and tracking of employees based on badge swipes.

Invite employees to provide feedback and work efficiently with the feedback to improve the culture and trust at the company.
Pros: + The work itself is interesting, there's a variety of projects with meaningful impact. There are also many opportunities and options to move within the company.

+ There are also a lot of employee-organised clubs and activities if you have time for them. 

+ The company is transitioning towards more modern ways of working with data.

Predictable, when you need to make overtime and they always communicate about it transparent and in time.
