Cons: For MT Program rotations place you in NYC, north New Jersey, or south New Jersey so it can be costly for transportation based on your housing location since you rotate every 8 months
Advice: None
Pros: Strong 2 year development program, quick to climb corporate ladder, employee benefits on products

Cons: The work environment at L'Oreal was toxic, they like to fire older employees just before retirement after they invested years into the company. They would also pay and give higher people coming from outside without experience or any knowledge much more that people who spent years in Loreal. They also like to promote people based on who you know and how good you kiss upper management’s behind. All money and experience you get from L’Oreal is not worth mental health that you loose shortly after joining the company. People are pressured to achieve their unreasonable goals , they don’t train you and they like to play finger pointing and malicious political games, we used to joke how L’Oreal must screw you at least once while you are there. I was there for 6 years and regret every single day spent in that toxic environment , I regret not suing them for the anxiety and depression I experienced for the first time in my life because of this company. Leaving this place and connecting with former employees made me realize I was not the only one. I joined L’oreal fresh out of college and I was constantly reminded how great of a company L’Oreal is and how we would not get smarter or better anywhere else, but omg I can’t express how much happier I’ve been since I left this hell.
Advice: more training , less politics , more respect for people who invested years into the company, don't be so cheap on company spending and learn to lead by example and by investing in people
Pros: Company Store Discounts and nothing else

Cons: Diversity initiative is mostly just for show. Advancement almost purely relies on politics. Expectations are not equal and overt favoritism is rampant. Trust is non existent as the culture is extremely dog eat dog. If you don’t fall in line with the status quo it will be very painfully obvious that you’re not accepted. If you’re an immigrant, woman of color, or older than 50, it’s likely you’ll either be ignored or pushed out of the company. Toxic managers are usually promoted and protected. There is no pre-established way of doing things so onboarding is a nightmare and anytime there’s personnel change it feels like starting over from zero. Headcount runs ridiculously lean in some business critical departments while other departments are over staffed. 401k contribution vests after 5 years which is abnormally high for the industry.
Advice: Continue to focus on the importance of psychological safety because there is a lot of work that needs to be done. A place of work shouldn’t feel like high school where the popular kids run the show. Transparent communication and feedback about promotion decisions seriously needs to be enforced. Instead of virtue signaling actually lead by example when it comes to communicating the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Pros: Free product, great company store, overall good work life balance (depending on your team and manager).

Cons: Oh where to begin... It is for one, so disorganized that no one ever has any idea as to what is going on. Second, you will never be fully trained on anything and no one will ever be available to help you yet they expect you to do everything 100% correctly. None of the upper level employees are friendly. oh also, not to mention that since this is a French Company, we were fully expected to work on the 4th of July and were not able to even request off since it was month end. After a year of good work, I submitted my (overly nice) resignation letter, offering to help in any way I could, and gave 2 weeks notice and my boss never even responded to me. She never thanked me for anything I did and never even said goodbye to me. It was an absolutely awful place to work.
Advice: None
Pros: Really the only pro is that you get some Fridays off in the summer but even then, they are very particular about which ones you can take off.

Cons: Toxic work environment, too competitive, benefits suck, 18 days of pto for the year, not even full 3 weeks of pto. no sick time, just pto/vacation time offered
Advice: None
Pros: Good Pay, free beauty products, stylish people

Cons: Toxic culture. HR is basically PR for the company. Gossipy/negative managerial culture is fostered from the top that creates a culture of looking out for just oneself - often at the expense of putting down others. It's really a shame, because these are some of the smartest people in the industry. This is a french, male dominated company. They consider having a older, white American male US CEO as "diverse" - they pat themselves on the back for this. That tells you something about how out of touch they are.
Advice: Stop approaching inclusivity from the white male gaze. Inclusivity and advocacy needs buy-in from the majority by incentivizing participation. Inclusivity is not just a POC or minority's problem to solve - it is everyone's problem to solve. More transparency on how promotions and salary work.
Pros: Good benefits - pension is unusual these days!

Cons: No negatives Simplifield was a pain . But I did it .
Advice: None
Pros: I loved all the years . I worked for the company . Have work . 35 accounts at a time . Have known most store managers form Kmarts to Ultas. Over10 different named stores. Through the years there’s been over 6 different styles of planograms

Cons: There was no support at all and interns are treated differently in different locations. It all depends on where you go. For me, I was bombarded with a bunch of work meant for two people with no help. I also had no work life balance.
Advice: I suggest you look after all your interns. Everyone is getting treated differently in different locations. Some interns get help to start full time jobs right after the internship and others get no help. My experience was stressful and very unprofessional.
Pros: The pros about this internship is you got to see the backend of how companies work and you do meet wonderful people.

Cons: The French culture can be too demanding for some, but it’s also this beautiful culture that gives the edge that makes the company succeed. The company has also put major resources into improving the work culture and employee work/ life balance and mental health over the last few years,
Advice: None
Pros: #1 beauty company in the world Many resources to support your vision Always driving forward// lots of momentum Inspiring place to be If beauty is your passion it’s the place to be

Cons: Tough work life balance Systems that are quite antiquated for the scale of work Didn’t feel appreciated amongst my partners in the role, which made doing the job quite unbearable at times Felt stretched thin
Advice: Great management just think they could stick up better for their reports. Often felt steamrolled because there was an expectation to meet all of our partner’s needs no matter how tedious and time it would take away from being analytical in our role.
Pros: Great benefits/ perks Competitive Pay World Class leaders in perspective industries

Cons: Strange work life balance even though they said it wouldnt be
Advice: None
Pros: Loved the company culture in person

Cons: My boss would yell at me and curse at me if I made mistakes. Would not give me constructive feeeback and used every opportunity to put me down. Training was hard because I’d request time on co workers calendars and they’d cancel last minute and then my boss got mad I didn’t get trained and wouldn’t hold the people supposed to be training me accountable. Glorified working 10-12 hour shifts in production plant
Advice: This isn’t high school, act like you’re adults
Pros: Access to company store, decent benefits, free products

Cons: improve compensation and growth opportunities
Advice: None
Pros: nice people, good benefits and a lot to learn

Pros: Good overall benefits. Some good colleagues

Cons: No hours during January &amp; in July
Advice: Better pay for vendors
Pros: Great products and the best fragrances

Cons: Poor communication from corporate office about important store or company policy changes affecting the stores Managers were scolded for not keeping up with policy change even when provided with no clear explanation of how the policy would affect store operations, both on the day-to-day and long term. Quick implementation was expected with usually 2 days or less which was not enough time for most stores. This was a very regular occurrence and was causing store staff a lot of stress. Corporate’s communication system with the stores changed multiple times over the 5 years I worked there, and they rarely took the feedback of those actually in the stores, (staff, store managers and trainers), on how we felt they could better communicate with them.
Advice: None
Pros: Loved the people, very passionate The overall message of the company was wonderful. I felt that it aligned with many of my own values. I loved my employees, my upper management and as a trainer, I got to meet, learn from, and help, other store managers across the country

Cons: L’Oreal has a great marketing machine to sell its products and project itself as a great company to work for social responsibility and sustainability, but what happens inside on how they treat employees is horrendous. They have not done anything significant to improve the moral of the employees and only care about financial performance (including putting safety second). They know that’s why they have high employee turnover but rely in its established brand name to continue attracting, abusing then re-hiring employees. In my department I have not seen anyone leave the company in good turns, everyone leaves the company frustrated. In less than 5 years I have seen about 50 people come and go. Some managers shows competence and experience on the business and cares for the employees. What is unfortunate is that upper management does not care they cannot operate with the head count we have. We need more people. This limits managers to do everything they want to do.
Advice: I don't believe Pulse is anonymous.
Pros: Free products and flexible time

Cons: Silo’s in learning new skills. Interviewed for a new role, hiring manager told me she didn’t have time to train me.
Advice: Tweak the interview process. Ensure internal candidates at least get an interview and a follow up from HR.
Pros: Amazing people, perks, and products.

Cons: -Promotion process (depends on the performance of others, not just the employee) -Salary is lower than market value -HR tends to be MIA with concerns -High turn over in certain roles, so at times it difficult to keep momentum
Advice: None
Pros: -Generous PTO -Vacation Buy Program -Company Store -Opportunity to explore different roles throughout your career -At the forefront of innovation -Truly wants to make an impact on sustainability -Lots of benefits for parents

Cons: get paid once a month, absurd hours working into the night to complete the production plan every month. management is all french and not many ways to work your way up the ladder as they really promote their own

Cons: Moving up can be difficult if you're not pushing for it
Advice: None
Pros: Overall good people to work with

Cons: The mgmt teams do not support their staff. They expect you to know everything. Training is a constant issue that gets pushed off onto someone else. Mgmt doesn't own their mistakes. Will leave you hanging when pressured by their leaders.
Advice: Support your team so they can support the business. Your job isn't to be in my way when I'm working and adding unnecessary processes.
Pros: Benefits are good, 10+ company holidays, vacation days as soon as you start.

Cons: Micromanagement especially from the younger, inexperienced managers
Advice: Empower your employees more. Involve them more when it comes to decisions that impact what they do

 -Underlying implicit bias/judgement by management

-Gossiping coworkers and hostile environment
 -No room to grow in field sales office
 -Who report you for (and not to) is in charge of your growth in your role and in the company 
-High turnover (because nothing gets resolved) 
-Who you report for will blame everything on you, call you instead of email you to not have anything documented 
-Not psychologically safe 
-Not considered a corporate employee, therefore HR could care less 
-Cold and humid office
 -Gaslighting and narcissistic management 
-Entry level employees are treated like trash
-Management change after first 6 months (new management still new to role, while other analysts still report into senior management)
Advice: You know what the issues are and could have a 0% tolerance policy but do nothing. There is so much time and money wasted due to so much turnover, drain the swamp.
Pros: -Good systems -Top 4 account 
-Okay pay for the area (not the highest in the industry though)
 -Hybrid model (most people in RI office go in twice a week, so not too strict) 
-Health Insurance is expensive but good

Advice: None
Pros: Helpful people, lots of experience, get on the ground quickly

Cons: Pay is horrible, commission is horrible, the culture completely turned into pharmaceutical culture. They track all of their reps utilizing a CRM that captures the time and place of real time sales calls. They micromanage way too much for a position that is entry level at best.

Pros: This is a Great company.

Cons: Sometimes overwhelming, too much expectations from one person
Advice: None
Pros: Nice and creative work environment

Cons: Recent lower management changes have made this place an absolute nightmare. Nothing but hostility, and harassment. Our department admin as well as our HR department is never reachable, and have no clue who to go to for these issues. Many current employees actively looking elsewhere. Certainly a “pizza party” culture instead of addressing the issues.
Advice: None
Pros: No benefits are worth the stress

Advice: None
Pros: proximity to business and incredibly smart colleagues

Cons: However, I did find out many things about L'Oréal. Even though the company states to be working on sustainability and has a lot of good press, 90% of its products contain orange plastics, and 77% of its products contain red plastics. Additionally, they still test on animals in countries like China and have operations in countries considered governed by oppressive regimes.
Advice: None
Pros: As a student researching wether L'Oreal really is sustainable, I can say the company is well organized, has a clear mission and vision statement, and has good values to make a good option for clients and other stakeholders.

Cons: Extremely corporate ladder climbing environment.
Advice: None
Pros: Stable once you are a full time employee

Cons: Not the most technical in career opportunities.

Cons: unrealistic expectations around workload for certain roles
Advice: listen to employess
Pros: fair pay, good benefits , &amp; work life balance

Cons: Toxic culture. Co-workers would rather throw you under the bus to accelerate their careers than see you succeed. Micro management is rampant, all the while 'managing up' is seen as paramount versus managers cultivating / developing talent. TONS of nepotism and unfair treatment based on who you know rather than how hard you work and how competent you are.
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing company if you're willing to completely invest yourself in Beauty or have a passion for beauty that means you're willing to go ABOVE and beyond (i.e. work weekends, work until 8 pm). Great portfolio of brands. Always tons of incredibly smart and hard working people around you.

Cons: To much work, poor vacation days
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture and benefits. Friendly

Cons: intense work environment and lots of approvals
Advice: None
Pros: it was a lot of fun

Cons: Management is pretty hands off and it feels more like a temporary contract rather than developing soft skills. Location is not great either and facilities are in major need of renovation (in progress)
Advice: Definitely switch from 2, 1 year rotations to 3 8 month rotations. This would be a good way to fit everything in and it works for the cycles too.
Pros: Good Benefits and ability to move around in rotations to see different parts of the company.

Cons: Management needs work on all levels

Advice: None
Pros: Free gifts awesome gifts Great emphasis on Ethical company They care about wellbeing of Great events

Cons: They claim to be flexible and place importance on work life balance but the truth is you will have to work insane amounts of hours to be recognized and considered for promotions. Toxic behavior is rewarded. Good luck onboarding, it's either sink or swim. The role you're hired for never winds up being what is described. People don't stay in a role long enough to form relationships or bonds with their teams. If you express unhappiness, HR does not help you find a better fit within the company. If a senior leader doesn't like you, they'll block you from moving roles.
Advice: Stop rewarding terrible behavior by senior leaders.
Pros: Pay is good and so are the benefits.

Cons: Revolving door company, difficult personalities
Advice: None
Pros: Fast paced, good experience, interesting work

Advice: None
Pros: Benefits, culture, growth opportunities, challenging, fun

Cons: - Toxic politics that take up too much of your mental health. - Terrible onboarding process, you will be thrown in the deep end with no lifeline. - small tasks can take months to accomplish because of high level of bureaucracy - not much mobility you will have to leave the job to get a higher pay - really high turnover
Advice: If you want your teams to work faster remove the barriers for completing basic tasks. - Acknowledge employee work and support them to stop such a high turnover

Pros: Quality of coworkers is high.

Cons: - Sometimes can be sink or swim environment and if you don't push yourself you won't be successful - Pay isn't the best in the industry, but you have a really amazing products that make a difference and are market leaders
Advice: There were some changes in leadership and younger and less experienced leaders came in that were too focused on the results and created lack of trust between employees and leaders.
Pros: + Huge network of coworkers who have a spirit of comradery + Seasoned leaders look out for their teams and foster an environment where you are always changing, learning, and growing + Expectations of leadership are super high, so you are always pushing yourself to do better and that's really satisfying

Cons: Mean girl-esque, lots of virtue signaling and not a lot of real action, easy to get overlooked if you're not the loudest, whitest person in the room, claims to be the most diverse but then doesn't have any programs in place to support diverse hires, two sides of the business: people who stay forever and people who immediately leave
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of parties and perks, opportunities to grow within the company, good enough work life balance at this level

Cons: Disheartening understanding that "clinically proven" really just means "a small group of study subjects believed they looked marginally better."
Advice: Quit greenwashing the company while making everything out of disposable plastics.
Pros: Amazing opportunity to scam the gullible public with dreams of youthful appearance.

Cons: Political, cut throat environment, May not be a fit for all
Advice: None
Pros: Largest beauty company in the world

Cons: Pay doesn’t increase by much beyond your initial hiring salary. Only way to make more is to be promoted, doesn’t matter if you simply become more skilled and efficient at your job. I’ve been told many times it’s not what you know it’s who you know, as far as getting promotions so if you aren’t good at politicking you may get stuck at a position. Peter principle is huge here.
Advice: Focus on rewarding your good employees regardless if you like or dislike their personalities
Pros: Good starting salary, large company with a lot of mobility laterally and vertically. Global company so it’s great if you are open to travel. Some great coworkers, good benefits, great work life balance.

Cons: Low salary, many employees lazy, leadership uninspiring...Overall not the best place to build a career
Advice: None

Pros: Good people to work with with a great attitude.

Cons: Nothing specific that I can share
Advice: None
Pros: Multinational company with different opportunities

Cons: Must be a self starter to succeed
Advice: None
Pros: The culture and ethics are excellent

Cons: Mgmt could be improved much
Advice: None
Pros: Fun and fast and frenetic

Cons: The high profit margins help paper over a lot of mistakes and stress, therefore no impetus on the part of the business for continuous improvement. Politics and appearances are tenfold more important than facts on the ground.
Advice: Heavily siloed into many departments, project management is atrocious since no one is able to bridge all those tiny kingdoms. No drive to improve on fundamentals, just chasing the latest marketing fads.
Pros: The high profit margins help paper over a lot of mistakes and stress, good people to work with.

Cons: Discriminative &amp; Toxic Senior Supervisor. Older generation, authoritarian senior manager who is not considerate to those with young kids, single working moms, those with learning disabilities and exhibits a certain distaste for some people of color. It's kept hush but many know this is the case and choose to tolerate it in fear of speaking up and losing their jobs. Be prepared to be micromanaged and if you resist, she will dismiss you. There's favoritism towards young candidates and who are willing to do anything to please and be available at a moments notice. There is no regard or patience for those who have younger kids, and if they become ill, (or come down with Covid), there will be no remorse or consideration. You may instead be served with "We are not a babysitting service." I know from personal experience when my 12 yr old had Covid and I had to work from home all week being I am a single parent. You'll be approached very fake and insincerely some days and others, you may get abruptly messaged for forgetting to change your status online from Break to Available for Calls and told your pay will be deducted. The Le Care staff themselves are wonderful ladies, however, you would need to be able to tolerate a toxic, discriminative, micro-manager. Performance metrics are not mentioned nor explained when onboarding. Over time, you figure it out if you take time on your own to see what each metric means. The performance metric that seems to matter most is cases per hour. Essentially that means getting the call or case down within a certain time is valued more than doing the cases CORRECTLY. If you're trained to be on the phones and handle e-commerce, be prepared for a constant technical and check-out nightmares. Functionality is sub par, Salesforce and computer systems in general are constantly glitching which slows speed down. Be prepared to manage frustrated customers complaining about their orders not going through or promo codes not working. The SOP's are unrealistic and very basic and barely help resolve unique issues. And if you ask, no one seems to know how to resolve it and are waiting for the brand to get back to them. The training provided can be overwhelming and 80% of the workload is e-commerce related which is not thoroughly covered in training. Therefore, there is a substantial amount of figuring things out on your own. This can be great for those who are resourceful and determined, however challenging for those who prefer step-by-step support and guidance. Senior manager has no patience or regard for those with learning disabilities like dyslexia, even if it's mentioned during your interview process. There have been a couple cases where I've witnessed people so stressed and upset to the point of tears because of how senior management approached them. Incivility is the norm. No concern for employee retention and morale though they talk the talk, yet don't walk the walk. No regard for high performers unless you're on senior manager's good side. Cannot ask too many questions or be "too" outspoken, otherwise you will be micro-managed to no end. NOTE: If you're "too good" at your job and look to excel in a higher position, there is a possibility of being held back from progressing to higher position within the department since senior supervisor must approve it and essentially, they need you and make their numbers look good. It's happened though it's kept silent and under radar. Temps are not given growth opportunities and are excluded from some departmental and company events, such as Christmas or other in-office parties. You will be asked to be on the phones or work until the end of day, even if the rest of the department was released to go home early. Overall, you're basically thrown into the ocean and left there to sink or swim. I would NOT recommend unless you need something for a very short time. Fair warning given.
Advice: Le Care is the front line to your consumers. There ought to be a supervisor who genuinely cares. Clean house of the narcissistic discriminative abuse.
Pros: This applies within the Le Care department. Great interdepartmental support and comradery among the staff. Staff are very pleasant and supportive when needed. Hybrid schedule

Cons: You do not need a Glassdoor review to know that L’Oreal is notorious for their toxic culture. There is a lack of openness to new ideas, limiting innovation and progression. Senior leadership is continuously preaching “group think” mentality. If you do not follow suit, brace yourself for some high-school passive aggressive retaliation. Do not waste your time working hard, only favoritism will get you where you want to go. Most importantly, say goodbye to your mental health.
Advice: Get rid of the stagnant tenured employees. It’s time to hire up and bring in external hires, who can put out valuable and actionable thought leadership and drive the change that L’Oreal needs from a business and culture perspective.

Advice: None
Pros: Budgets are ample so great for business

Cons: Not enough time in the day to get your work done means working long days. Head office demands too many forecasts and budgets which in the long run becomes very tedious. The amount of work required for each trend and budget process is enormous meaning you don't have much time to focus on driving and influencing the business day to day. The company goes mental when the HQ come to visit and bend over backwards to please them. Management will produce about 100 slides for a 30min presentation which puts a strain on the office teams.
Advice: Better work/life balance required. Less trends and budgets, so more time can be spent adding value and financial insight for the brand management teams.
Pros: People that work in UK offices are generally nice and friendly. Good team spirit. Reasonably good pay and bonus. Good progression if you work hard, but tis means people are in roles long.

Cons: The company has an extremely “agile” culture which can be detrimental to those who prefer process-oriented solutions. “Agile” is also a word sometimes thrown around to cover for unpreparedness or unstructured/unclear way of doing things.

No definitive roadmap for management trainees on the possible rotations or landing roles after completion of the programme.

Mismatch between how the company brands itself as a very tech-driven company however work processes are still very much lacking.
Advice: Value its management trainees more through actionable steps. 
Pros: Good company to join if you want to immerse yourself in an international workplace with colleagues from around the world (Singapore office). 

The company embraces entrepreneurial spirit as one of its values and is generally receptive to new ideas.

Young and vibrant crowd in the office.

Cons: 1. Not really competitive salary &amp; very low internal salaru promotion percentages (under 20%) 2. No work life balance (OT is normal and company doesnt have OT incentives program) 3. Political everywhere 4. Unethic workplace &amp; employees treatment: A. Some of former employees who were contractors - didn't get their contract renew however company still ask them to go to work, and promise will renew the contract. Then when the employees got sick and must take leave for illness treatment in hospital, company took that reason not to renew the contract with them because "you're already on leave anyway, we will hire you back when you're healthy if your position is still "in need". Hence, the former employee got no health insurance to cover their hospital fees. B. Former employees report ethics od their line manager on company's system - which is anonymous. And HR took that review and told the line manager this is what your team wrote about you. 5. Bad &amp; old office building. There is no space for newcomers, and no one took care of them (laptop, email, workspace,...). My N-1 had no where to sit and we asked for support but it took 2 weeks just to find a proper place to sit.
Advice: MUST CHECK ON ETHICAL CASES. We can bear with the package but the environment is getting more and more unethical, that's why your turnover rate is significant high right now
Pros: 1. Flexible working hours, we get 2 work-from-home days per week 2. Supportive zone team 3. Freebies &amp; complimentary products, especially if you work in sales/marketing department 4. New projects and scopes for you to learn

Cons: Too much work politics Senior staff abuse their power, too relaxed and do not provide guidance or support to Juniors Favouritism amongst staff I have personally witnessed inappropriate behaviour between senior and junior staff especially at work socials, which isnt spoken about Rudeness and lack of compassion for other cultural and religious beliefs by Manager Whatsapp group chat full of colleagues showing off and over sharing
Advice: Improve training and be more involved in the regulation of how everything is run
Pros: Great benefits - Private Healthcare, Company Car, Phone, Laptop, Ipad Pro, Company AMEX Flexible work life balance

Cons: As with many global companies, it's a fast-paced place that might not suit every person. You need a lot of energy and stamina, but it's rewarding when you see the results.
Advice: None
Pros: L'Oreal is a great company, with global reach and an ever-growing focus in sustainability, diversity and inclusion. Locally, there's a good structure, excellent benefits and some of the most passionate and smart people in the industry. It's a pleasure to see what the teams can achieve when they work together.

Cons: Very fast paced A lot of work I need to ask manager guidance. They dont give you training and expect you know how to do everything when you first enter. Wanted to work as marketing, however ended doing different position. They couldn’t give me what I wanted as there’s no position available and they expect you to just accept any position that they offer due to business needs.
Advice: Need to improve on the organisation structure
Pros: -Flexibility. wfh 2 times a weeks. I go to office at 10:00 or after lunch sometimes and go back at 6:00pm (if I finished my work) - Benefits is good. Free products &amp; staff purchase discounts. And a lot of events.

Cons: Very chaotic and hence stressful environment. Agenda and your tasks could vary within days and even hours changing to exactly the opposite. People are sometimes promoted more because of their obsequiousness to superiors rather than professional merits.
Advice: Focus on building a meritocratic environment and designing grades or other incentives to retain young talents
Pros: Great supportive people, the company invests in new projects and actively develops data and analytics fields

Cons: Systems put in place are not stable. Constantly developing new system but literally unused within the same year. Managers do not know the processes well either. You will get frustrated with the system, and the longer you work, you feel like a boomer with all the manual work involved.
Advice: Simplicity is your tagline, so focus on current processes, stabilise, before moving on to your next target.
Pros: Carefree environment for certain depts. Pantry is decent. Pay is decent. Hybrid work arrangement.

Cons: Competition: The beauty industry is highly competitive, and the Senior Product Manager must constantly innovate and differentiate L'Oreal's products to stay ahead of rivals.
Advice: Emotional Intelligence: Understand the emotions and needs of your team members. This can help you address issues with empathy and build strong relationships.
Pros: Global Brand Recognition: L'Oreal is a globally recognized brand, which can be attributed in part to the efforts of the Senior Product Manager. The widespread brand recognition instills confidence in consumers and helps drive sales.

Cons: You can't work 100% remotely There is a lot of pressure (that could mean long hours of work) If you don't get used to it's flexible culture, you can feel overwhelmed and that the company is not organized Work/life balance
Advice: I think nowadays the flexibility of working remotely is becoming more important, so they should consider this at least in some positions, and find creative ways to still spread their culture among all the employees. I think it is possible.
Pros: Career path A lot of training (if you like to learn new things) Flexibility A lot of learning opportunities You can (and sometimes must) develop your own proceses and management

Pros: L'Oréal sincerely puts "people first", be it employees as their staff, customers who purchase and distribute products, or consumers who use products. Staff are encouraged and included in learning and development programs. Managers support and guide their teams. Teams from different countries are happy to collaborate and with each other and work together to achieve good outcomes. Customers have good relationships with their account managers and are proud stockists and distributors of the L'Oréal branded products. L'Oréal follows processes that work for the business and their customers. Consumers, aside from myself, are my family, friends and many across the world. People I interact with, all know L'Oréal, its a long standing company name, and they enjoy the products. L'Oréal impresses me personally with their research on consumer needs and invest in creating products to suit all skin types, all hair types, all cosmetic and beauty preferences based on their research. I am extremely proud to work for this company and see myself retiring here, because outside of my comfort home-sweet-home space, L'Oréal my work-sweet-work space

Advice: None
Pros: Free products

Cons: No cons from present experience
Advice: N/A
Pros: Amazing company to work for

Cons: Micromanagement, very operational position, work load too heavy, you are not well formed or not formed at all by anyone but it is expected that you work as if you has years of experience in the company, company culture of gossip, people don't treat other with respect, people leaving because of a burn out is very common and normalized, the majority of people I met had the impostor syndrome developed when they started in the company and not before.... You leave no earlier than 19h30 because of the work load.
Advice: Is a whole thing of savoir-être that will be improved if the work load was less, as stress levels could decrease. Teams need more people to make it less stressful so hire more people. Also the culture of radical autonomy without teaching is a cause of this bad savoir-être and environment, if people where formed in their position they would be less alone, stressed, confident and so many errors would be avoided, people would be more motivated and not feeling this impostor syndrome.

Advice: None
Pros: Cheap canteen food, nice people

Cons: High pressure for success 
Heavy workload and long hours
Advice: None
Pros: Fast paced environment with potential for advancement
Stimulating and challenging work

Cons: Social committees are division based, so the amount of staff perks can vary per department depending on how enthusiastic the committee is. Can be busy, workload can lead you to working overtime. Sometimes department headcount’s are stretched thin and rehiring takes so long that there’s always a gap between a person leaving and a new starter. New starter on-boarding from external can be slow and frustrating (IT equipment not available straight away, not having access to files or email groups, no knowledge of where things are saved…etc)
Advice: Mandatory training for staff becoming people managers for the first time.

Advice: None
Pros: Good pay, great company benefits

Cons: Male dominated leadership team with old school, bullish approach to achieving their goals. On paper, it would seem to advocate strong ethics but this is more for the soundbite/ticking the box than genuine commitment to social values.
Advice: If there is an opportunity for real change then fully commit instead of reverting to type when challenged. Be more open to criticism and accept the need for change rather than automatically defending your position. Learn the lessons that are gifted to you
Pros: In some sense one of the best/worst companies I've worked for. Very good employee benefits and in terms of ambitions to provide a great place to work it could be a market leader if it wasn't for the cons

Cons: - Toxic environment: Terrible middle-level management (great upper level C-Suites) - No work-life balance (would recommend starting your career here for sure, great learning, but then get out before it kills you) - Not merit-based, promotions are based on how well you know people and how you manage relationships
Advice: Invest in your people, culture and work life balance, it'll help the 50% turnover rate year on year
Pros: - Huge budgets to work with - Thrown in at the deep end (no guides, training or onboarding) - Cutthroat culture (again, great learning, but if you don't perform or are not good in politics, this is not your place) - Lots of perks and great for your CV

Cons: On the human resources/people management side, I found that L'Oreal doesn't care much for their people. When I encountered a personal issue, they promised their support, since they understood that my circumstances were out of my control. They could have helped, and they certainly had the resources to do so, but they ended up doing nothing, even when my abrupt leave of absence left my team stranded with projects. Honestly, great place to work, nice people, and the job was quite fulfilling. But I didn't feel valued as an employee, so even when I finally managed to sort things out and was able to resume work, I chose to leave.
Advice: Do better about caring for your employees' wellbeing. Especially since it's a commitment you claim to have made.
