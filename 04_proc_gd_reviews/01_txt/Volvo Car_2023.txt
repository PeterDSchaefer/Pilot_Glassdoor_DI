The directors specially in the Mahwah office are not technical at all and are leading the technology stream without knowing what to do. As a result they end up making wrong decisions and playing blame games to hide their incompetency and making sure anyone who points out their mistake get fired.

Cons: Can feel a bit slow sometimes
Advice: None
Pros: Good work-life balance, friendly colleagues

Cons: 1) No growth: Non-Swedes, you can forget it. They talk about flat organization, but reality is total politics, behind you. They talk behind you and do things behind you and saying that its Swedish culture. Its BS, in my view.
2) Salary - Basic pay. If you perform then you get 0.5% more than average. So do not work hard, its useless.
3) Change - They talk (talk talk talk talk talk talk) a lot about change, nothing ever will happen. Its the same OLD Swedish managers stay there, maintaining the status quo. 
4) A legacy automaker, which does not know the direction (or has the courage) to take (because of leadership of-course), in my view. Time to move out for me. Warning - to those who are ambitious, then this is not the place to come.
Advice: Mid-management will make or brake any organization, and this is 100% true for Volvo Cars. If whole middle management are Swedes, then you can forget about diversity/change/innovation/speak-my-mind/etc/etc. You are killing the legacy and the company. Pity is that these people (middle managers who are saving their seats) does not see far ahead or even realize it, as they are being very selfish. I really like Volvo Cars and want it to succeed, but seeing the direction it is taking, I doubt.
Pros: Work life balance is good.

Cons: Old offices with really awful coffee machines. Awful middle management, in fact I was illegally rejected for part time study leave by my manager which is a law in Sweden. Not much room to improve professionally. Performance reviews are joke. Middle management is not doing their job well. Imagine a company that lays off 25 years old who's eager and motivated to contribute and keeps a 65 years old who is about to retire. Have become really bad in the past year.
Advice: Instead of changing same uncapable managers' title to Engineering managers actually hire some engineering managers.
Pros: Work life balance is usually decent but overtimes are not rare

Cons: There is a lot of nepotism in the Spanish office and incompetent people are being promoted to managers. it is sad to see to see that they give off a global image but then act very Spanish. Lack of the authentic Scandinavian culture from Sweden and not all employees have the same rights. HR sometimes 'forgets" to communicate and is ruling the office with the iron fist(Spanish way). i can't remember if I ever had an honest and objective performance review. The worst of it all is that headquarters don't care about this office and see this place as another cheap labour location.
Advice: Don't pretend to be global but act global Do a major sweap in management. Hire less talkers and more do'ers Work on your teleworking policy if you want to retain employees
Pros: - nice cars to drive and amazing family bond benefits

Cons: High expectations compared to salary(because local), suboptimised teams, different units has their own goals, peolple have too much work to be able to do something great
Advice: Help with prioritizing. Do not put all the tasks on high achievers, it will make them leave for something else where they can get more back, instead. develop the low achievers so that there can be optimal teams where everybody helps eachother
Pros: Interesting tasks, big projects, cool cars and technologies, Great possibilites to develop as a leader

Cons: Lack of benefits, work for long hours without opportunity to claim OT, pointing fingers and blaming people rather than to move forward for actions plan.
Advice: None
Pros: Good place for learning, fast moving, for someone young and want to learn many things good place to go for experience.

Cons: The whole company culture is awesome. But if youre not lucky you might get a manager with different attitude
Advice: None
Pros: No overtime working
Managers understand challenges you might face in your personal life and theyre flexible as long as you deliver

Cons: The leadership is incompetent at most levels. Managers bullies employees with the support of the HR organization. The so called "speak up culture" is in practice only allowed if it is positive. No constructive criticism of feedback is accepted. Managers support each other and distance themselves from the employees. 50% of all manager recruitments are friends according to a union survey. The manager culture is rotten to the core. Leave if you can.
Advice: The management needs to be replaced on all levels and a new sound culture needs to be nurtured from scratch and down to up. This includes the complete HR organization. Listen to the employees and the unions. Work together on a rebirth of the company and management culture or die as a company. It might be too late already to do something about it.
Pros: The colleagues are in general good, helpful and friendly.

Cons: Old management view, decisions, micromanagement( Management, HR department) with low soft skills, low implication(some with almost none skills) for the growth, develop, culture support, of the employees. Low salary budget, almost none trainings. To much manual work( old financial systems, procedures) for a multinational company that sells premium vehicles, 0 investments in the automation and in the people. The employees are the ones who raise the company.
Advice: Trainings for the management for developing soft skills, communication, training ( internationals) to open the mind.

Cons: The engineering managers for the Data Engineering teams make this place horrible to work at. They skip or ignore feedback in the tech interviews to make sure their friends get in. They are also actively working against each other and one manager has even been told they’re not allowed to speak to their subordinate manager because they can’t behave or treat them with respect.

Advice: None
Pros: Good for Family life the worklofe balance

Cons: I had the opportunity to work for this company, and I must say that my overall experience was quite disappointing. The company is deeply rooted in old-fashioned practices and seems to operate with a work philosophy from the 80s. One of the major drawbacks is their claim of striving to become a software company, yet the reality is quite different. The management's approach to people and work resembles something from the 80s, lacking modern flexibility and innovation. Salary adjustments are incredibly rare, and there is a prevalent culture of micro-management, which creates an extremely toxic environment. For any software engineer in the market, I strongly advise against considering this company. The lack of flexibility, slow adaptation to new technologies, and toxic work environment make it an unfavorable choice. If you value a modern work culture that encourages growth and innovation, this company is definitely not the place for you.

Cons: Where should I start?! -The organization is sick! Hard to stay motivated with all the not explained changes and blockers! - Tasks and responsibilities are not defined for each person or even teams. - Too many changes! - Managers talk in a different language and are from a different world. Their ideas are presented to lower levels on a very abstract level, nothing concrete or actionable.
