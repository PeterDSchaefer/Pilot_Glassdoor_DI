Cons: Roche values are just catch phrases. Ultimately, many leaders don’t follow them or openly mock them. They aren’t held accountable to them. Apparently no mandatory leader training to improve their people skills. A bad leader is allowed to be a bad leader indefinitely and without accountability. Illogical spending. Blow a ton of cash on a cafeteria that didn’t need replacing and have a manufacturing space that needed expansion 5+ years ago. Nickel and diming that project now.
Advice: Critically evaluate leaders and replace bad leaders. Apparently, management is not evaluated on how well they live the Roche values and treat their workers. As long as they brown nose their superiors, they keep the job. I know the HR (P&amp;C) response will be that management is evaluated on living Roche values, but there is no evidence to support it. Mid/upper leadership is not held accountable for poor GEOS results, either. If leaders were held accountable to values or GEOS, my leader would have been replaced by now…
Pros: Decent pay, good benefits. Some work/life balance and flexibility depending on where you work. R&amp;D seems to have very flexible schedules. Site CEO (Jill) genuinely seems to care about worker wellbeing and making it a good workplace. My criticism of leadership does not apply to her.

Cons: - Pay is drastically different between RDO and RDC for the same position
- Consistent "reorgs" make it hard to know who it responsible for what
- No accountability for anything
- Raises are computer generated and it doesn't matter what is accomplished during the year everyone get the same raise outside of management.
Advice: Start holding people accountable and stop using computers for end of year raises.
Pros: - Benefits such as healthcare, PTO, etc. are all great
- Pay is ok

Cons: Processes are overblown and operational innovation is discouraged in favor of maintaining the cumbersome status quo. If you're not a "lifer" then you "obviously don't understand how business is done here". Complex bureaucracies dominate the management landscape, more so than other companies of similar size. Corporate leaders will hand down edicts with little consideration of the impact on people and processes that are affected, as long as senior managers are satisfied. Many middle managers are zealots who spout out vision statements without living up to those values.
Advice: Figure out how to transfer the concept of innovation from your product and solutions into your core business operations. Treat people of all tenures like human beings and not chess pieces. Live all your values, not just those which are most convenient.
Pros: Pay is insane, benefits are solid, and opportunities for growth are probably very good. Crazy talented people at the individual contributor level.

Cons: Poorly defined departmental duties and individual roles. Initiatives tend to be rolled out without adequate communication between departments impacted. We seem to manage ourselves most of the time, but at a certain point this can be frustrating and at times feels like we are set up to fail.
Advice: This is one of the best jobs I've ever had, but that is being overshadowed by the feeling that we are not appreciated by management and management does not fully understand the work we do.
Pros: The work is challenging and I enjoy my day-to-day tasks. I feel I am well paid. I genuinely like and respect my co-workers. I also enjoy assisting and interacting with customers.

Cons: Cumbersome business systems and tools. Over regulated
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits, work-life balance, interesting technology

Cons: Less compensation compared to competitors
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance and working culture

Cons: Can feel separated due to new ways of working digitally
Advice: None
Pros: Remote opportunities- access to industry tools

Cons: Sales teams are more highly valued than other teams that enable the organization. The company supports the right leadership skills in practice, but there are a lot of leaders that don't live up to the company's stated commitments.
Advice: None
Pros: great benefits, good pay, purpose driven work, smart colleagues, progressive people programs/policies (e.g., DEI initiatives, mental well-being, parental leave).

Cons: Less salary compared to competitors
Advice: None
Pros: Good company and good working culture

Cons: not many bad things to say
Advice: None
Pros: cool, great place to work

Cons: Long hours with an irregular schedule
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits
Field employees receive a company vehicle

Cons: Time off could be better
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits to have there

Cons: A lot of reorganization and management turnover
Advice: None
Pros: They care about you and your career

Cons: Where do I even start. 1) Be prepared to always get the line, "You're salaried, you should be working for as long as we tell you." While this is ok sometimes, it's is definitely not ok all the time. 2) No one (in upper management) gives 2 cookies about your disability, an accident you were in, your kids' schooling or your newborn. Either work and don't complain or get unreasonable work loads and be fired for not working well. 3) Have a dental or doctor's appointment? Sorry but take that during your lunch break but also be available during your lunch break for meetings and how dare you not be available. 4) Top people from Roche are here, act happy everyone! 5) Did I mention the mandatory 8am to 6pm work schedule? No exceptions. 6) I'm management and I'm never wrong, you must be the one doing something wrong. You take care of it, I'm too busy to help you. Honestly, I can go on but that should give you a good idea why the Seattle location is such an awful place to work. There are other great biotechs in Seattle, you'll absolutely regret it if you work here.
Advice: Learn some empathy please. Not everyone has an amazing life like yours.
Pros: If you like being backstabbed by your manager and some choice coworkers, this is the place for you.

Cons: Favoritism for certain employees. Hard to get promotions
Advice: Please consider all aspects of employee contribution 
Pros: Great benefits, good pay, easy job

Cons: Big company feel, pay is lower, lots of projects started and not finished.
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible, lots of opportunities, stable

Cons: Roche uses Accenture as a consulting company, and Accenture consultants are generally clueless individuals who use big words to sound fancy and spark political wars at work. Roche itself has very strict hiring guidelines, but it seems Accenture will hire anyone with a degree which really lowers Roche’s quality. Roche employees are hand picked individuals with certain personality aspects and work ethics, but because of Accenture employees being all over the place, Roche employees aren’t able to focus on what truly matters. Customer satisfaction would truly be higher without Accenture having so much of a say in how customers are handled.
Advice: Pay more attention to the negative effects Accenture consultants have on the business. They know how to sound smart, but there’s no quality behind their words. They’re hurting the business greatly.
Pros: Salary, Bonus, Benefits, Flexibility, Quality Equipment

Cons: Compensation was low for scientists
Advice: None
Pros: Awesome company, nice benefits, and colleagues

Cons: Over the past 5 years, leadership has created a culture that rewards political maneuvering over production and achievement. The cultural value of speaking up is no longer safe to engage in. If you are not sharing positive news, you are not rewarded for making data driven analysis of the current situation.
Advice: Listen to your employees Be data driven, not personality driven Stop rewarding politics and return to valuing employees who deliver
Pros: Employees are quality from across the board in every department Compensation is above average Healthcare mission is genuine

Cons: Constant change in strategy leading to non-stop changes to organizational structures and periodic layoffs
Advice: None
Pros: Strong portfolio, competitive in the industry, well managed

Cons: Came in from the high tech industry as an engineer. Salary is not commiserate to high tech. But, from what I understood from other co-workers, the biotech industry in general does not pay as well. Came out disillusioned about the healthcare industry. I left high tech to help make the world a better place. It is not always about the end patient, but really sometimes about profit.
Advice: None
Pros: Had some really good managers overall. I really like the people in my department at the time. They offered a comprehensive health care plan including psych.

Cons: nothing to add as cons
Advice: Improve new HR operating model for greater customer experience and business impact. Improve DEI efforts
Pros: Great culture, engaging mission &amp; purpose, leadership

Cons: Some divisions teams respected and validated more that others by executive management - and allowed more "grace"; geographically dispersed (global) teams not allowed to travel occasionally to collaborate better and build better relationships (i.e. commercial + engineering + product)
Advice: Definitely some divisions and organizations within Roche have better leaders that teams are now trying to move into
Pros: Good culture at individual teams' levels; trying to be diverse and inclusive; great benefits that need to be taken advantage of

Cons: Little to no growth depending on your department, pay could be much better, too much change and lack of direction for the future of the employees, no optional remote work for lab support
Advice: Pay employees more to retain good and hardworking team members, take risks on FTE who are trying to expand their career growth and branch out in different departments
Pros: Good benefits, good working conditions

Cons: Communication from managers wasn't that great.
Advice: Better communication
Pros: Roche cared about there employees..extremely generous

Advice: None
Pros: Opportunities to rotate across functions, lots of innovation in lab and in business

Cons: With great success comes lots of work and responsibilities. Need to hire more people in key functions and roles.

Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Good company to works, respectful environment.

Cons: Sometimes there is inadequate training.
Advice: None
Pros: Remote work, good pay, great colleagues

Cons: Processes are so complex here that it is stifling
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits, D&amp;I is very embraced

Cons: It is FAR from the high tech company they advertise to be. Wiped out benefits during covid, managers are trash and on yearly employee audits managers get horrible reviews but nothing changes, a revolving door of VIPs take all the funding while they blame the labs working on skeleton crews. VIP's directly tell you it's not about helping people, its about getting them a new yacht (no joke). Tons of office politics, and I've seen some disturbing anti-lgbt actions. Tons of company cover-ups whenever they do any wrongdoing. Not as bad as Thermo, but they will totally screw you over on pay and FTE conversion.
Advice: Fire all of you, you are horrible, yes YOU. Parasites like you should listen to your employees, but you're so entrenched with your politics and cronyism that you wont. STOP THROWING EMPLOYEES UNDER THE BUS WHEN YOU SCREW UP. People literally die from Biotech lagging behind where it should be, because you managers take 45 vacations a year.
Pros: It's not the worst out there, work life balance is treated well.

Cons: Since the new CEO took over Roche Diagnostics things have been going down hill. First a push to get people back in the office with no performance/efficiency reasons stated. Flexible work environment is going away, employees losing choice of whether to work remote or in person for any role. And now occupancy sensors are being installed. Roche is losing its competitive edge in regards to employee compensation and flexible work environments.
Advice: Pay employees at least close the midpoint of the salary range and don't force people back into the office. People will be productivity (or unproductive) regards of where they are, you are just impacting employee satisfaction with your decisions.
Pros: Good benefits, stable work load, opportunity to learn new skills.

Cons: I have found that the Talent Team can at times be competitive which is good if its healthy. In the last 6 months, I have experienced 2 -3 scenarios where my colleagues used " gaslighting" to attempt cause issues for me here at Roche. I enjoy the work but believe even in today's market team work &amp; collaboration should always come before egos and attitudes.
Advice: I would suggest team building exercises that help teams focus on the company values - integrity, courage and passion. 1- integrity i.e. take the high road 2- courage i.e. courage for peers to have tough and honest conversations 3-passion i.e. have a passion for team work as nothing is accomplished by one person it takes a team to build a company.
Pros: It is great to work the business here at Roche. The managers are great about partnering with talent teams and engaged in the process. The best part of my day is supporting their teams and efforts.

Cons: They are wary of "outsiders" - if you haven't been there for 10-15+ years they are skeptical of you, your ideas, and your motives. They don't seem to want to improve - continue to keep and promote the "old guard"
Advice: You say you want innovation and simplicity, yet your culture doesn't.
Pros: Great pay and benefits; a great mission that truly helps society (especially during COVID); generally kind co-workers

Cons: Gossip, gossip gossip....Including managers, everybody talks behind another. It's a shame truly, because Roche company itself has been doing great work in patients' lives. Bad management, instead of teaching the material, they give you bunch of sighs and eye rolls. Sadly, the people are not professionals/ take their jobs seriously. It's a good company if it's your first time job. However, career growth isn't supported. I felt discriminated and excluded throughout my employment.
Advice: They should reevaluate their reasonings of being there. They need to have a professional attitude at all times.
Pros: Stable environment. Unlimited sick days.

Cons: long distance from my home
Advice: None
Pros: good benefits and work life balance

Cons: Heavily matrix organization with too many layers of management
Advice: None
Pros: Company is a Swiss based and has good benefits

Cons: No room for growth or promotion. Showed alot a favoritism to certain employees. I’m the end a lot of people left.
Advice: Invest in employees and promote from within. Too many times I’ve seen new people come into leadership roles with no industry experience. Which would upset the ones who have been with company and have the experience but wasn’t given the chance.
Pros: The Benefits were absolutely amazing.

Cons: Over emphasis on policies (diversity &amp; inclusion and moving jobs to lower cost locations) have created: 1) Limited career growth opportunities 2) Inexperienced and incompetent leadership
Advice: Look at talent valuation vs hitting diversity and cost cutting quotas
Pros: Strong product pipeline and market reputation

Cons: Very Good place to start with
Advice: None
Pros: Nothing, great place to start

Cons: Worst professional environment ever seen in my experience. People discourage others , speak ill of the team and it wasn't a healthy environment place to work with, and I strongly advise HR team to take action items on the same. They do layoff on Full time resource due to their bad financial budgeting and create a lot of chaos.
Advice: None
Pros: Lot of technologies are used and hence you can have a chance to work in various technologies Employer benefits and bonus is good

Cons: Salary is fair but still lower than the market value

Pros: Good work life balance and great benefits

Cons: Slow growth in the company
Advice: None
Pros: Company culture as a whole is amazing

Pros: Good company, good benefits, nice place,

Cons: Compensation is not as competitive
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of opportunities to learn

Cons: Nothing bad to say about Roche, as I have not experienced anything negative.
Advice: None
Pros: Roche is great company to work for they hire talented folks. The culture is great and across collaborations among teams is great. Management empowers individuals to make decisions and to challenge when their are doubts.

Cons: Training isn't the best, you'll have to self train in many instances. Internally, the company can be disorganized. Alphabet soup of acronyms can make understanding the landscape and players a real challenge.
Advice: Fix your training program and have a better understanding of ALL the things you do. Vision is too siloed, frequently important changes are made without considering the ramifications across all of Roche's divisions and departments.
Pros: Large company with some top-notch people. The company is enlightened and progressive with lots of opportunity for all sorts of people. There are opportunities to stretch yourself.

Cons: -Arrogant and frankly unqualified management; highly questionable work ethics and non-existent communication between shifts or between managers and employees -Layoff hundreds of employees, only to use employees left from other departments to fill in the gap, displaying lack of foresight -Constant pressure to do more with little-to-no reward -Gradual decline in the perks of the job in spite of personal performance
Advice: None
Pros: -Benefits are well-rounded, although have been slightly worse recently -90 minutes of breaks, 1-hr paid -Most people have a degree of integrity and respect towards one another

Cons: Very high level of cronyism. If you don’t know the right people or have the right friends, you’re not going to move up.
Advice: Be open to hiring people based on their level of experience and competency. It’s not right to place a job opening and not seriously consider the candidates who apply.
Pros: Great Place to Work. Take good care of employees. Great benefits.

Cons: They are not focused on the customer. The processes prevent innovation. Entrenched middle management is powerless and unmotivated. Internal politics and culture suppress getting simple projects from getting done.
Advice: Empower your teams to better support customers, which has inherent risk.
Pros: They make robust regents most of the time and have a brand. The people are nice. If you work there for over 5 years you can maybe promote.

Cons: The cliques are bad. There are no benefits or PTO for contracted employees, and there is no guarantee of being converted to full time status at the conclusion of your contract. Contracted employees are not allowed to use the gym, and do not get the same holidays.
Advice: Respect, value, and train employees to improve retention. Listen to the professional opinions of those doing the work for insight on improving workflow before rolling out changes.
Pros: There are benefits (medical, dental, vision) offered to full Roche employees.

Cons: Random schedules and long days
Advice: None
Pros: Good work culture and bonuses.

Cons: Management is horrible. Now RDO and RDC are being combined back into one. More people to lose their jobs is on the horizon.

Cons: I can’t think of any
Advice: None
Pros: They provide advancement opportunities. They value health of the public. They have outstanding benefits

Cons: There's no feedback loop for subordinates to provide feedback regarding supervisors. I was having problems with my manager and when I talked to leadership, they knew there were some problems with my manager and others but didn't ask me or colleagues what the issues were; we weren't able to speak without feeling we would be penalized.
Advice: Manage your supervisors
Pros: If you're local to your team, you can build relationships with your manager and team.

Cons: A lot of disorganization and poor communication with no real motivation to change. Some managers are great - others are terrible, and there doesn’t seem to be any desire for further management training to ensure that this is less hit or miss.
Advice: None
Pros: Large employee network and great female leaders.

Cons: Strict Manager and hectic supervision

Cons: The laid a bunch of people off regularly.
Advice: None
Pros: Good hours, benefits, opportunities, and food.

Cons: - Work Environment: Managers here are very involved and enjoy micromanaging. They see overworking as a badge of honor and expect you to do the same. There is now very little flexibility, working hours are absurdly long. About 95% of the site do not have children… and god help you if you do because you will have extra obstacles if you want a promotion, a high visibility project, or in general the flexibility normal salary positions provide. There is very little diversity especially in upper management. Managers are supposed to be supportive and while some managers here do deliver results, they are not leaders. They are supposed to mentor and help you grow… each member of your team is different and that’s what makes it great. But managers here only want a group of yes men and conformity.  Employee satisfaction and morale is down and yet they turn a blind eye and produce an environment where people are scared to speak up because a nail that sticks out gets hammered down here. Your interests as a scientist are not valued and project priorities shift way too often for your interests to be pursued. The few managers that value work/life balance and flexibility have either left or have been overrun. There were fortunate groups with those managers that had the freedom to come/go at whatever time they please as long as their work got done. Some groups were not afforded that “luxury”. Management’s response? Make everyone’s hours long! So if you want to work 8-6, 7-6, or 8-7 or more for 5 days a week on a below market salary then this place is for you. 

Career Movement: There have been times they have “forgotten” to promote people over the years and have done others wrong by intentionally holding them back due to “company needs” (AKA they are having hiring/training issues and can’t get a replacement ready for your position). And since this is an R&amp;D site only, there are no opportunities to make lateral moves into departments like Quality, Regulatory, Manufacturing, etc. Compensation Salary is very mediocre at best especially with the hours that are being worked. Very little was done during the high inflation year.
Advice: Management will not take criticism as they are set on regressing back to our old ways so my advice is to at least provide flexibility in hours, pay more to match the hours worked, and hire more people so they are not as burnt out and can do their best work for the hours they are there. It is most definitely a skeleton crew at the moment.

Lastly, please please please self-reflect… Why is it that you never ask for your teams opinions? Ask how we are doing or if there’s anything you can do to make it better for us? Why is it all take and no give? 

Leaving is so hard and heart breaking but it is no longer bearable. We are passionate and trust worthy employees but we also just want a life outside of work and flexibility. But apparently that is too much to ask for…
Pros: The benefits offered are good

Cons: management is not so good
Advice: None
Pros: salary is up to market

Advice: None
Pros: Very stable company, and great science

Cons: toxic coworkers senior management does not have a clear strategy on product launch
Advice: None
Pros: Genia had a free snack room

Cons: Being a huge company, your experience for the same role might vary widely from group to group. Lots of red tape, training etc and as lean as it’s trying to become you inevitably run into a career professional who’s worked the same way for 20 years, is now quite high up and doesn’t want to budge on their positions. But almost every project is on a 5 year plan. Industry works that way, so if you’re looking for a faster pace, not the place to be.

Pros: People, growth, vision, product quality

Cons: Leadership is not accountable for demonstrating 'Roche values', and is incredibly 'top-down'. Employees are not empowered to make decisions.

Cons: Very corporate style of culture

Pros: The people, the flexibility, and the overall mission of the organization.

Cons: The company has a very clickish way of working. If you’re not in, you get shown the door. The company also lets people go while they are out on disability after 17 year of service with no insurance or benefits. Management doesn’t care about their employees.
Advice: Maybe show compassion and consistency in your operations and hire and keep people that actually do their jobs and don’t take credit for other peoples work.

Also, if you plan to apply for a job at Roche, be prepared for the recruiting/interview process to drag out 2+ months and have to reach out to the recruiter on a weekly basis to get a status update.

Advice: None
Pros: good company and ....people were not that kind

Cons: Leadership was incompetent, with many smokers, who with their smoker fan-group made gossips about the non-smokers, who worked while the fan-group had their smoking breaks - in addition to their normal breaks, coffee breaks, wellbeing breaks etc. Some TLs ran relationships with members from their teams, allowing them whatever these wanted, i.e. daily lateness, extra days off. Then somehow only these fan-group members (usually HR and QA colleagues) were promoted, and presented as top-performers, who even in their rare and short work intervals between the breaks and their constant meetings, with usually close-to-zero technical/IT skills were still allegedly the top-performers. Meanwhile the ones beyond the fan-group (usually the ones with high-level IT/language skills) had no development opportunities, and once having realized it, one after another left the company. Hopefully things have changed in the meantime.
Advice: Hire a new HR team, so you do not let diversity prevail over competency.  Hire non-smokers for new positions, give non-smokers extra days off to compensate smoking breaks. Have less meetings - instead work. Acknowledge the silent performers. Instead of bothering and time-consuming useless psychology trainings focus on technical ones, IT, accounting, language. So then instead of being taught how to say nicely that you cannot solve the issue, you are actually taught how to solve the issue.
Pros: high payment, fancy high-tech offices and equipment, well established company

Cons: - Constant changes and you're never going have certain processes or settings stay forever, or even past few years.
- Product portfolio although diversified, but current landscape from a global perspective is not looking all sunshine, some product line are losing money but there are also other products that makes record breaking revenue and that balanced out overall revenue. New acquisitions and investments may not be making money so soon. 
- Upward mobility may be a little lacking, but horizontal moves are more possible and it's up to you to take charge of your career growth.
Advice: None
Pros: - Good work life balance of work, occasional night calls due to time zone differences.
- Colleagues in general are very respectful of your time off, and rarely do they disturb you on your time off. 
- Flexible work arrangements, hybrid working model of once per week in office.
- Mostly healthy work culture here, there are some politics but none so far have cripple work and deliverables.
- Overall compensation package is not bad, base salary is average and there's definitely companies who can pay higher out there, but you may sacrifice some benefits of working at Roche.
- Option to order free lunch whenever you're going to the office.

Cons: On a global level, RDC have completely lost their way. Slow to market with new products, complacent about whether customers will use them. 
UK culture - has turned into a "boys club" with one team dictating direction and everyone else's views and experience discounted. Lost a lot of good, long serving people recently. I feel sorry for the good ones who are left. Customers are bewildered as to what's happened to the company and why great products have been withdrawn.
Is now so small, career opportunities are severely limited - and unless you're in the little clique, forget it.
Advice: Globally - for goodness sake launch something and make it universally compatible. Stop being so complacent. Sort mySugr out, they are draining funds and integrate them properly.
UK - Talk to the right people re NICE guidelines - stop wasting money talking to people with no influence. Listen to your staff.
Pros: Nice office, great staff restaurant and gym. Pays well, hybrid working and great benefits.

Cons: - Not much promotion expectations if you don't speak Swiss German or have a Swiss degree. - You might find some disrespectful colleagues if you didn't study in Switzerland or you're not understanding Swiss German. Not the most though. That's not Roche exclusive. - Many repeated software tools, apps and procedures that could be unified. Some of these are obsolete. - Project managers only give priorities but rarely due dates. Afterwards they come up with urgencies, specially when they gave you 3 or 4 tasks with high priority. - Project managers don't communicate clear requirements for the tasks. Be sure you deliver a very good solution because they don't appreciate iterations and shall quickly escalate to the team manager behind your back. - Almost nobody makes minutes of meeting. Be sure you make them in order to defend yourself in front of the project manager, your team manager and his manager afterwards. Thankfully, the team manager shall most probably defend you.
Advice: SMART objectives would be a good beginning. Please make minutes of meeting. And face the problems with the colleagues directly, not their manager!!
Pros: - Workers rights and work-life balance are important in Roche. - Once you're in, they try to keep you. If your project expires, they try to relocate you somewhere else. - Very flexible with home office and working hours. I can be working at home and, when needed, drive to the site and do whatever I need to do. - They provide all the tools needed for the best work conditions. - There's a control meeting with your team manager each week. He shall help you in anything you might need.

Cons: The high standards and expectations can create a competitive workload, which may not suit everyone.
Advice: To ensure Roche Basel remains at the forefront of innovation, it's crucial to streamline decision-making by simplifying processes while preserving accountability. This approach will empower teams to respond more swiftly to emerging opportunities and challenges. Furthermore, by supporting employee well-being through programs addressing stress and promoting a healthy work-life balance, we can foster a workplace culture where our team members feel valued and energized to contribute their best. In response to evolving work dynamics and employee expectations, Roche should explore hybrid work arrangements that provide flexibility. This adaptation aligns with current market trends and empowers our workforce to excel both in the office and remotely. To amplify our collective capabilities, it's essential to enhance collaboration within the organization. Encouraging cross-functional teams from various departments to work together, facilitated by platforms and incentives, will drive innovation and the sharing of diverse perspectives.
Pros: Working at Roche in Basel, Switzerland, has been nothing short of amazing. The campus, the people, and the mission make it an exceptional place to work. Roche's commitment to healthcare innovation is inspiring. We're surrounded by brilliant minds dedicated to making a difference in patients' lives worldwide. The work-life balance is excellent, and professional growth is actively supported. Roche values sustainability and social responsibility, making me proud to be part of this community. If you're seeking a place where your career can flourish while contributing to a greater purpose, Roche Basel is the place to be. Join us in shaping the future of healthcare!

Cons: The chief accountant team is relatively new to the shared services. The workload doubled within span of last 2 year. More stuffs are being pushed to the accountants place without bothering on work life balance. Some cluster lead accountants are not even qualified accountants and the global head doesn't even bother about the work life balance/welfare of the team. more favoritism in the team, which makes the talented ones leaving and those who bravely voices out gets kicked out from the company. only puppets/followers are remaining in the team. the affiliates/local country finance tend to bully and blame the accountants, by pushing matters/task through backdoor without proper communication and approval.
Advice: while shared services wants to take over more services from local team, it doesnt mean that all the rubbish is dunoed to chief accountants. When there's issue with employee, it should be adequately discussed, else it becomes constructive dismissal. Should involve middle/independent party, else HR team tends to favor the team head and employee gets penalized. Affiliates aren't right all the time.
Pros: 1. great culture. 2. subsidised professional fees. 3. free breakfast/lunch 4. need to go office only once a week. 5. no fixed working hours 6. yoga room &amp; pool tables 7. coffee machine 8. free trainings via linkedin 9. subsidised professional training fees 10. google style office - hotdesking, collaboration area etc 11. well equipped with IT gadgets and software 12. has inhouse stage for small events 13. great healthcare/insurance package for employee and family 14. lots of employee related activities

Cons: Leads / Managers tech stack is old school
While working on latest tech stack, sometimes it is difficult to convey the exact technical hurdles due to such limitations of leads.
But, they still do consider.

Fewer people than needed (could be project specific)

Promotions are hard to come. Increments are low once joined.

Increments and bonus are based on company and product performance.
Advice: Could be more engaging on how to carve out a career path for individuals. What are the steps people need to take to grow in Roche.

Also, if there are good yearly increments, I can say most of people will not even look outside for jobs.

Apart from this, you guys are doing a great job!

Keep it up!!
Pros: Good work life balance
Good pay
Good facilities
Peace of mind while working
No micro management
Activities other than work are good
Job Security.

It is a very employee centric company I feel

Cons: Environement is toxic, there is a lot of nepotisim going on, there is a division between people who came without connection and with connection (they are treated differently by managers too), speakup culture is a lie (you should never speak up, if you do not have a connection, because you will be viewed as trouble-maker), investigations are formal and aimed at making you look like an idiot. Middle managers just want to cover everything up to keep their positions. There is a sense of fear that senior managers will find out. Everyone just wants to keep their positions even if hurts the company.
Advice: Be more involved and don't blindly trust middle managers. The company punishes people who are passionate about their job, who have integrity and courage to speak up.
Pros: Salary, fully paid sick leave, number of vacation days

Cons: Constant process transfers and tool/platform changes. Platforms are not operating well and not supported well technically. Projects are led by unexperienced/low skilled PMs. Job scope and volume is highly different in the AP teams for the same salary. Lots of new tasks and reorganizations are happening without any compenzation. Most of the people are tired and fed up with the never stopping changes and extra tasks.

There is no real career advancement salary increase is low when you change jobs.
Advice: Define clear scope and adjust salary to it. Let people rest and work as normal not in constant project mode. Hire PMs thar are able to take responsibility and lead a project through.
Pros: 4 days home office and a yearly 10% bonus.

Cons: You are vulnerable due to numerous transformations in all departments in the company. This is mainly to do with reducing headcounts almost every year since the last 5 years.
Advice: Reduce your thick senior management layers and empower the front end workforce, focus on retraining on new technologies or business opportunities. Build a company that leads the world again.
Pros: As long as you are in this company, you learn a lot and get many opportunities to explore and experience different fields in healthcare.

Cons: Roche has been a very successful company for many years, reaping the benefits of a strong Swiss work ethic. However, this constant success has led to a low sense of business acumen throughout the organization and a very powerful HR (P&amp;C) department. Combined with a desire to follow every new trend from San Francisco and chase high ESG ratings, this has unfortunately led to an environment that is heavily influenced by woke and gender ideology. Performance, impact, and accountability are no longer values that are being recognized.
Advice: Recognize and promote Performance/Business impact and be more pragmatic in regards of purely social political agenda. C-suite appears disconnected from the business and do appear arrogant in how they address concerns from employees
Pros: Campus infrastructure and canteens are great. Basic Benefits (saleries, bonus etc.) are decent

Cons: in constant reorganisation, no time to work in between. Fear culture. Speak up culture has become a joke. Poor senior management.
Advice: Marketing is important at all level in a company but when 95% is just marketing and 5% real work, you wonder how the company can make money. No surprise: real transformational work takes time and no one is given 2 years to take such risk between 2 reorganisations. My advice: reorganisations should happen only 5-6 years. Hire managers based on concrete proven delivery experiences not on how well they sell themselves. 
Pros: big companies perks and advantages

Cons: One of the IT areas have continuous re-organizations since years. I like the company, but they do not give us a rest just to peacefully could focus on our work and our work/life balance. The management with these changes - reducing headcount and costs - giving us the stress factor. And we also can not travel anymore freely on business/workshops to meet our Colleagues face to face. Earlier there were more career opportunities, I also do not see such strategical or motivating positions anymore. They keep the salaries on much lower market level than few years ago.
Advice: Stop continuously cutting budget which impacts the regular employees. They should rather cut their own salaries and also the number of managers should be greatly reduced, this way could have a lot of savings.
Pros: Flexible working with home office. Parking is available for employees. Good location in Budapest. Modern office environment. Nice loyalty benefits.

Cons: In the last 2 years, there have not been as many career growth opportunities within the company as previous years. Roche has a lot of employees on contract positions. Job stability has been at risk during 2023 with a few restructurings going on within the company. The hierarchical structure can sometimes slow down decision-making processes in the company.
Advice: None
Pros: Roche provides a diverse and inclusive work environment. Roche fosters a culture of collaboration and teamwork. Roche invests in emplooyee's growth through training programs, and opportunities to work on diverse projects, fostering continuous learning and skill development. Roche practices agile methodologies. The company benefits (medical aid and pension fund) are great.

Cons: - Bavarian collective wage: You earn approx. 400-500 EUR per month less than your colleagues in the same position in Baden-Württemberg. 
- Living expenses in the region Upper Bavaria is quite high
- Penzberg itself is rural and unattractive, thus commuting to Munich is a good temporary option
- R&amp;D Core Lab environment: Long-term planning is not possible due to temporary contracts, extreme toxic and selfish behaviour of some colleagues, micromanagement and mis-management of some line managers, monotonous work without responsibilities and development opportunities
Advice: None
Pros: General pros:
+ Corporate benefits (subsidization of daily shuttle bus to Munich, gym on site etc.)
+ Family atmosphere on site
+ Regional base but international focus
+ Beautiful nature with a lot of outdoor activities offered closeby 
+ Chances for development and career

Cons: Terrible management structure, especially in engineering.
Terrible HR who hide complaints, back senior managers and circumnavigate their own policies and employment laws to suit their narratives.
Advice: Shake down your management structure, listen to those lower down the ladder and you'll find a lot of voices all shouting for the same thing, sack your HR before they land the company in a lot of legal trouble and stop with promotions based on ability to brown nose and not actual skill sets.
Pros: None now, plenty of "benefits" but they're just a drop of honey in a cup of poison.

Cons: Woke / ESG-hooked, so performance, experience and education aren't primary promotion criteria anymore. Recent (pandemic) restructurings into "teal"-like organisation (chapters, networks, squad) is a catastrophe: almost zero career progression opportunity combined with a zero accountability culture (self-organised teams, you know, so Chapter Leads not tied into the success of their "members") // Basel fading in relevance relative to US and this is reflected in leadership appointments and work culture.
Advice: Stop the woke stuff (if you can re: ESG requirements) Reverse the "Teal" nonsense it isn't working and hasn't ever worked Fire senior/executive leadership en masse (accountability for teal and chaotic re-re-restructurings) Make the use of plain English a point of business
Pros: Infrastructure Basel location Facilities Multi-disciplinary

Cons: a certain department has poor management, thus high turnover rate
Advice: instead of just a top down review, do a bottom-up review too, and ensure the reviews are taken seriously, with actions taken to improve the situation.
Pros: wonderful environment, good place to learn and stay

Cons: The cost of shipping back the items are not covered by the company, although they were shipped out by them.
Personal development is not highly supported when it comes to IT topics (not leadership) - lack of free time for self-development.
Hardware can not be chosen and the team building budget is way too low.
Missing trust.
Advice: Less cost cutting for IT, more salary can bring a higher value to the products and delivery of the service itself.
The tech field within a company is the most important part of developing.

Less salary, no fair compensation is demotivating and results in resignation and burnout.
Pros: The Work-life balance is great.👍🏻

Cons: Base payment could be bigger or more specific for certain countries. We had enormous inflation and got no compensation yet.
Advice: A salary increase in heavy times makes a long way.
Pros: Roche plans with it's employees on the long term, this is why the benefits and the company culture is fair to everyone.

Cons: Given we try to be on the cutting edge it is a fast paced and quickly changing environment meaning it is often ambiguous and learning as we are experimenting in some areas.
Advice: Focus on what are the capabilities of the future, wellbeing and resilience to ensure employees are able to be at their optimum
Pros: Always looking to do what is needed in the future to bring new treatments to patients, not limited to the science...lots of emphasis on how we come together and do what we do internally and with external customers and stakeholders. Provides diversity in opportunities available and is great for someone that loves to learn and stretch

Cons: The backfilling of people is really slow, and this combined with the high inflation in the country equals us working more for less. On the long term this might motivate people to leave and the current status could become more unbalanced. There are a lot of unnecessary information going around the company- there should be some measures taken to prevent information overload for all the employees. When human beings are translated to numbers, every single aspect of our work should be taken into consideration. Or just don’t try to interpret people into units. This cannot be done anyway as everybody works in a different pace and the management will never truly know the actual efforth until they have tried to do the job (long term). There is no opportunity to go up the ladder nor to step up to higher positions thanks to the ‘innovative’ organization strategy. People are stuck in the same position.
Advice: More appreciation with mentioning the EXACT achievements. By saying ‘thank you for your work’ would not motivate anyone and makes the impression of not paying attention to the incredible amount of work put into different projects or just simple routine work everyday. Actual inflation following raise would be great. Or some kind of ad-hoc compensation to raise up the morale a bit (and keep people). Not enough trainings/ learning opportunities are provided or they are not organized/ advertised well that could be used at possible future positions or other workplaces. There should be more available positions in the same areas. The grading system should be revisited as the descrptions belonging to the grades do not cover what people are actually doing. It should be great if there would be a consultation involving all the departments ( each employee!) what is not apt and how should it be amended. I have to mention the Workday platform: it is horrible and should be changed as soon as possible.
Pros: Flexible home office-office time, very good office, good equipment, IT guys are very able and helpful, great team and generaly good choice in management.

Cons: No significant drawbacks to mention. In certain roles, particularly support positions, many functions are centralized, limiting opportunities for growth. Nevertheless, there are avenues for personal development by collaborating on projects with others
Advice: Management may consider diversifying growth opportunities for employees, especially those in support roles. Explore ways to expand their responsibilities or offer career development programs that align with their interests and skills
Pros: A strong culture of open communication and transparency is actively encouraged. Employees are given the freedom to leverage their talents and skills without unnecessary micromanagement. The renumeration is also great.

Cons: Long work hours, some employees are doing all the heavy lifting while others coast. Some senior management have so many direct reports they are unable to really have a grasp on what their employees do/don't do. Workloads are more often than not, uneven. More reorganizations than I have ever seen in any other organization, many times very senior or tenured employees let go.
Advice: Connect with your direct reports frequently to ensure they are able to manage workloads and reassess when not.
Pros: An amazing employer overall everything from from compensation to the beautiful Mississauga office is designed with employees in mind. Lots of job opportunities and especially if you're willing to move internationally. I can see why some employees spend a majority of their careers with the organization.

Cons: Very divided nationality-wise teams. Internal office wars are over the top. Very strange management and unfriendly staff
Advice: You can do better job
Pros: Good pay and infrastructure. The location and office are good

Cons: Career path model makes it complex to grow up fast People too confortable sometimes
Advice: Roche is an amazing company, with a great spirit that you feel once you belong to the company. Also, offices are great equiped and atmosphere is awesome. For technology related people, there is always time for improving skills and testing new technologies and apply in the real world. Important to highlight, really flexible (smart working policy) and easy to balance work with personal life.
Pros: Company really cares about employees. Training opportunities all the time. Great atmosphere at work Cutting edge technology

Cons: They will try to know how much you earn in your previous position to get that number as a starting point for the negotiation, in order to benefit them.
Advice: None
Pros: Everybody is very friendly. And the salary and benefits package are really good.

Cons: No job security, if your boss doesn't like you he or she will use PIP to through you out of the company. Unethical HR Practices.
Advice: Get into the things. Your good employees are either leaving or thrown out by wrong leaders and so called managers
Pros: A playground to learn and experience

Cons: Not really a con but you just need to go with the flow of changes and participates actively in the changes
Advice: Nurture internal and existing employees to grow and learn. Not everyone may have the direct experience but it doesn't mean they cannot do the job well but they will need a chance and opportunity to do it.
Pros: Good culture and environment
High collaboration 
Management often takes opinions of staff

Cons: Poor Leadership
No guidance or direction
Toxic politics
Unstable organization structure
Advice: Should focus on employees career growth and path.

Hybrid Working
Decent Pay Scale

Cons: Transformation fatigue, more difficult to for talent to keep developing, some poor leadership from managers (not the CEOx)
Advice: Avoid having the flavor-of-the-month type of managers with a hierarchical attitude. Results and outcomes are a must, precise. However, some managers believe their deep, detailed review and obsession with asking for more is effective. We are losing what made Roche great a decade ago and are not taking care of great people anymore with limited development opportunities.
Pros: Great family tough for such a large company, great campus, culture and meaningful work

Cons: No line manager or direct report to consult with

Pros: - an experienced company with great values and knowledge 
- positive working environment 
- good benefits

Cons: Slow growth, lot of micro management, less recognition for the work
Advice: None
Pros: Work culture is very goos

Cons: Our ambitions are really high. Accordingly, Roche expects a lot from its employees and managers. In addition to the provision of services, the Roche culture also attaches great importance to the mindset and how we treat each other. This at any time and in any situation also during transformation.
Advice: Global approaches are very helpful in many aspects, but not always the best solution! Sometimes local processes and/or regulations would support patient needs even better. Our efficiency in working together would be greatly improved by a standardized nominclature of the organizational architecture in our network. Please clarify this.
Pros: Roche has a strong pharma AND diagnostics division. This combination enables us to optimally support the challenges related to health. Roche is broadly positioned, invests heavily in R&amp;D - also for niche products and has a convincing portfolio in the pipeline. It makes me really proud to be able to make my contribution to "Doing now what patients need next" in this company! Roche attaches great importance to attractive working conditions and jobs.

Advice: None
Pros: Benefits, Comp, Location, Office, Salary

Cons: Processes galore, usual big company challenges
Advice: None
Pros: Excellent people, opportunities for growth and career

Cons: People and culture practices are disorganized and behind times. While D&amp;I are huge topics and publically supported and endorsed through talks, HR practices and benefits do not fully align. Maternity and healthcare benefits for a company that seeks to drive healthcare transformation and betterment are worse than companies that don’t even have a mission in healthcare. Global senior leadership in the sales and marketing (commercial) organisation is messy, poor, and honestly severely lacking. Lots of talk, meetings and design sprints but no real action on their side to implement change. Colleagues and peers carry the weight of the work and receive only verbal support than mean very little in practice.
Advice: Completely restructure and reorganise the global senior leaders in the commercial organisation Overhaul Hr benefit practices, we can’t afford to provide median or average benefits for our employees health, when our mission is to elevate the healthcare across the world. Practice what you preach And do more to support D&amp;I goals through policies and HR practices. Events and talks are great but it needs to permeate the entire system.
Pros: In general, loads of wonderful colleagues who care for patients Peers walk the talk and finely believe in the mission Purpose-filled work

Cons: Base pay is lower than it should be The communication in-house is terrible No visible action is taken when there is a problem The pipeline from intern to employee needs improvement Management lacks motivation, experience, understanding
Advice: It's worth considering that when multiple team members leave within a short period of time, it may not be solely due to the individuals themselves. It could be worth taking a closer look at the team's management and identifying any issues that may be causing employee dissatisfaction.
Pros: Home-office is great Work-life balance is nice The benefits are not that bad Colleagues are supportive and friendly

Cons: you cannot work from abroad and if you change position you salary increase is minimum

Cons: sometimes personal development is blocked by hierarchies and existing structures
Advice: None
Pros: you have good benefits at roche

Cons: Technical teams are under the leadership of non-technical managers. If you possess strong technical skills, you might find frustration in dealing with managers proposing strange and baseless ideas. Despite the company's global presence, the teams remain isolated and resistant to embracing diversity. The majority of projects are outsourced to external firms. Given that it's a pharmaceutical company rather than an IT one, exercise caution before proceeding unless there are no other alternatives.
Advice: Revamp the outdated IT leadership. They seem disconnected from the value they bring to the company and often generate unnecessary requirements to impress upper management. Prioritize projects that contribute to the company's revenue generation.

Advice: Focus on the basics
Pros: Some great people to work with and generally speaking a good diverse pipeline so different disease areas to work within

Cons: Hard to define or recognize overarching strategies.
Advice: Make sure the new leaders are empowered by the crowd and based on merits, not by a few acolytes. Inclusion is more than just putting a white female into a leadership position they were hardly assessed for. You need to continue developing them.
Pros: Wide network of colleagues, mostly with scientific excellence.

Cons: Very stressful work, high level
Advice: None
Pros: Very great place to work

Cons: Workload, limited flexibility and career progression.
Advice: Improve the salary structure and perks.
Pros: Great culture, people and environment.

Cons: Despite how it may seem outside, there has been too many transformation within. This affects morale in general. As for the particular team I was in, most colleagues are truly godsend but the management of the team is weird - don't be fooled by the flashy job description, you will end up doing 10 different roles in one. Everyone is expected to "volunteer" and take on unrealistic workload. Lots of peer pressure to conform and go with the Roche way. Expect long hours if you join this team. Expect to be like instant coffee, 3 in 1 role. It has been a disheartening journey that didn't get better. Forget about career progression. It is so called "flat hierarchy" and you'll be in the same role for decades. A quick research of the team and you will notice the attrition isn't great - for all the reasons above,
Advice: None
Pros: Pay and benefits are average compared to other pharma/biotech but still alright

Cons: Workload/work life balance. career prospects
Advice: None
Pros: Salary, rewarding work environment. Great international support system

Cons: The company went through an HR transformation in 2021 which resulted in having a really small local HR team and an SSC in Budapest. Even more than a year after the transformation, there is no clarity regarding what tasks belong to whom and the lower you are in the hierarchy the more tasks you will get from your local colleagues in higher positions and there is no option to say no. My manager was in Budapest while I was working in Woerden. My manager and my Budapest teammates had no clear idea about my tasks and had a terrible relationship with the local team. I belonged to both teams and when I was with the Dutch, I heard complaints about Hungarians all the time which was verging on racial discrimination. The team located in Budapest holds grudges about the Dutch team which results in a toxic environment in which the person in the role of People Support Specialist is in-between. The lack of knowledge and understanding of Dutch labour law and Dutch language in the Shared Service Center results in lots of mistakes when it comes to the work of those supporting the Netherlands remotely.

Cons: Risk adverse Can be difficult to navigate when new. Complex informal and sometimes political networks which take time to understand Due to size and complexity, can be slow to act. Internal stakeholder management can be frustrating Still struggling to give early in career talent a stronger voice. Experience is often over valued more than potential Pays at the midpoint but it's pharma so that is still a great salary
Advice: Strive for more simplicity. Pay more attention to the voice of early in career talent to understand what future employees are looking for
Pros: Large healthy organisation which has a great internal job market with global opportunities Respectful culture, working on and improving diversity &amp; inclusion Interesting colleagues from all over the globe Highly networked and evolving towards a more agile way of working Passionate about patients Head Office in Basel is great for work life balance because of the size of the city Pharma with a purpose

Advice: None
Pros: Innovative and engaging culture in Roche

Cons: too hierarchical
intern salary too low
Advice: None
Pros: good employee benefits and team environment

Cons: Mountain loads of red tapes and layers and layers of internal processes and ad hoc tasks from customers that take most of our time from ACTUALLY learning product knowledge and doing ACTUAL sales. Benefits could be better as an MNC. And from a sales point of view incentive structure is so underwhelming for a MNC. And no claims for toll &amp; parking when going out on field when that is the industry standard comparing with other pharma/ med device MNCs. They claimed to have it covered in our monthly allowance (which is also lower than industry standard) - claims for toll &amp; parking should be a given, given how we HAVE to travel to do our job &amp; get sales
Advice: Cutting off benefits slowly is discouraging and incentive structure should be improved to match industry standards so as to keep talent at the company.
Pros: No micromanagement and flexible working culture as long as work is done. Good and collaborative working culture. From a newbie like mine’s POV everyone is helpful and willing to land a helping hand

Advice: None
Pros: Brilliant place to work, the Burgess Hill office has a great group of people

Cons: Management changes too often and with them, drug development focus
Advice: To listen more careful to the teams that provide feedback for management decisions. To have a long term vision and build on what has been done, avoid 100% changes with every new middle upper management change

Advice: - Implement better structure and find better ways to make it easier for everyone to find information in a more consolidated manner. - Lots of opportunity for cost optimization. Many duplicated efforts and unjustified expenditure. - Really exemplify and embrace 'One Roche' across the organization. There are still segregation between Dia / Pharma / RSS mentality evident among employees: in terms of budget allocation, benefits, exposure and equal credit.

Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, good leadership, strong benefits, nice campuses

Cons: some areas are severely under-resourced. It can be hard to get support sometimes as a lot of functions are outsourced and not local anymore.
Advice: Actively participate in the development and implementation of continuous improvement initiatives. provide guidance and advisory to first level support teams.
Pros: Roche 's company culture is characterized by open-mindedness, motivation and trust.

Cons: No plan. No structure. No concept of getting anything done at maximum levels of wastes. A culture and management that prevent tough conversations, with middle management filtering anything that is not praise. Everybody being "nice" is part of the problem. This is known on CXO level and can be seen in public analyst reviews and market capitalization. Yet, what is done about it is too little and too amateurish on all levels of the enterprise. "Transformations" that don't lead anywhere as they mostly focus on reshuffling hierarchies to reduce headcount, while conceptually little is achieved to change what is done and how. The lack of quality data paired with maximum complacency, never looking outside how good looks like, makes everything opinion-based and consequently political theater. A false narrative of being a learning organization means that nobody in the higher ranks takes accountability, as everything is part of organizational learning. However, this is done on the back of thousands of employees, creating change fatigue that drive good people out of the company. Therefore, success is entirely based on leadership's opinion about an individual or group, never based on tangible impact. This leads among others to an incredible amount of PowerPoints that look beautiful, praising false successes, while there is little to nothing under the surface. Since nobody knows who does what and how to work together, the amount of meetings and workshops without agenda, concept, meaningful outputs is impressive. Advancing in the company means playing the theater for enough to get promoted based on tenure. This can be seen by looking at the trajectory of employees on LinkedIn.
Advice: Take a hard look at your enterprise strategy and the people that are tasked to execute it. Out with the old, in with the new. Start measuring, implement Lean and quality control beyond the amazing products that the company offers. Act with speed and accountanilty, nobody is waiting in 2023 for Roche to figure out how to be an efficient and effective company.
Pros: Minimum controls on what the employee does, where he works, what he achieves. Ability to apply for any project anywhere in the company. Everybody is extremely nice on interpersonal levels.
