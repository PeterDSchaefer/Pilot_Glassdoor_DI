Advice: Get semi annual employee reviews of managers, opportunities, equipment etc,
Pros: Product was superior in classes.

Cons: The company is very conservative, which slows its innovation and market share growth.  Because employee retention is so high, there is limited opportunity to grow into new positions, and they are the slowest I've ever experienced with regard to static promotions (eg moving someone from an engineer to senior engineer, which doesn't require a vacated position).  The salaries are also very low compared to similar positions in automotive companies located outside of Sweden.
Advice: None
Pros: The work environment is relaxed and positive, and one of their greatest strengths is their employee retention.  With so many people that have been working together for so long, the company works well together in many ways.  The company has many ways in which it is employee centric and offers a lot of possibility to move around within the organization.  Current changes in corporate structure may improve cross-functional work and information exchange, but it remains to be seen as it's a work in progress.  The benefits are good and the management is flexible to the life interests and demands outside of work.
