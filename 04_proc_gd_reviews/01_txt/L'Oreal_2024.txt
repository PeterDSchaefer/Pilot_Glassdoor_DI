Cons: Management needs to improve their hiring
Advice: None
Pros: A lot of room to grow

Cons: HR turnover leading to an impersonal relationship with management blocking upward mobility, employee rewards like titles, promotion and salary
Advice: The best companies put employee compensation and rewards ahead of stock holder dividends. Promote and reward from within the company as that is what made Loreal what it is today.
Pros: Corporate ethics, Environmental and Social stewardship, new management approach and training, some nice perks (company store, volunteer days..)

Cons: Sometimes navigating the structure of power can be hard esp if you feel your immediate boss does not take in your views as quickly as you want

Advice: None
Pros: great for growth and career developement

Cons: - poor leadership and bad management you will be worked to the bone 
- HR and leadership don’t have any formal structure for promotions and raises 
- archaic technologies and work practices this company is so far behind!
- the salary is a joke, incredibly non competitive with the market
Advice: Have clear goals for promotions and raises. HR needs to be called out on this they are doing a poor job. 

Also no one gets fired here, if you have underperforming employees or senior leadership who are hurting a department they should be let go!
Pros: - Profit sharing program you’re pretty much guaranteed a bonus every year
- access to the company store you receive 50% off all brands. There is a free goods program but it’s not enough money.

Cons: senior leadership is very much lacking in empathy and does not seem to care about the actual people
Advice: show more real empathy and care
Pros: working with a lot of great, talented people and opportunities to grow

Cons: Lacks community - Needs more interns events
Advice: None
Pros: Interesting company, fun projects, engaging

Cons: Base salary, stress, workload, out of touch upper management
Advice: PAY the good ones. It's more expensive to hire someone to fill our roles. When roles are eliminated or people leave, either fill the role or pay the people that have to pick up the slack to do the now two jobs they're doing.
Pros: Benefits, paid time off, hybrid work

Cons: All teams are lean and overworked and the culture is toxic.
Advice: Train on healthy boundaries and communication.
Pros: The work is fun and entrepreneurial.

Cons: Safety Manager, Looks exactly like Mr Bean. Behaves like Napoleon. He constantly brags about "I run the plant" and tells leaders that he doesnt like that he "will not be inviting them to his lake house."
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible work hours, constant state of change, they do a good job of indoctrinating employees and building morale. Leadership at this company is more about marketing yourself for the next job than it is about successfully completing the Job at hand. This creates a culture where people try to climb over each other to reach the top of the mountain. Collaboration is disingenuous, because people are merely playing the game to reach the next position. Loreal is a Marketing Company at heart, and this permeates through the entire business to the leadership on the manufacturing floor. Trust of peers is non-existent, Its all about your ability to sell yourself for the next job....and stepping on the back of the next guy to get it done. The only this company remains successful is they make a product that cost 2 dollars and they sell it for 22 dollars.

Cons: Not much to complain at this journey.
Advice: Try to minimize the numbers of unnecessary meetings.
Pros: Encourage people to strike balance of work and life. Never ask to work on the weekend!

Cons: There’s no level playing ground. Very much a ‘who you know’ to help your career movement and progression. Environment depends on your boss and team so can be very diff at one place vs another.
Advice: Get rid of senior management that isn’t engaging or hasn’t helped move your companny/brand forward. You pay some of these people so much when in reality they haven’t really accomplished anything, don’t mentor to build the team, and team under them does all the work for zero credit/reward
Pros: Good benefits and they are really trying to be better company with additional focus on well being. Lots of resources for different information but also means a lot of different opinions on your business.

Cons: Management will support dishonest employees to go ahead and not the actual good ones.
Advice: None
Pros: More number of leaves, yearly gifts

Cons: Transfer of shared services for the payroll department was subpar. Too many of the legacy team left due to not being able to relocate and the ones left did not share all of their knowledge. There are gaps and constant fires to put out. Current leaders have unrealistic expectations for workload, knowledge transfer, process improvements. Constant changes and not allowing team to learn a process in full. Aside from departmental concerns the salary increase wasn’t even enough to adjust for cost of living and very disappointing.
Advice: They need to push work away from the department that isn’t payroll related. Improve work life/balance by bringing in more staff and not allowing burn out. Also to have a better understanding of what their subordinates do because they don’t understand a lot of the processes we do and in turn cannot effect change or provide the support we need.
Pros: Free goods, benefits, hybrid schedule, yearly bonus.

Cons: Will throw you under the bus as a scapegoat
Advice: Prepare new employee with all the politics he/she will be challenged with

Pros: amazing atmosphere loved working there

Cons: Hierarchy, internal politics, reactiveness, inability to innovate.
Advice: L’Oreal is an amazing company to have on your resume, rightfully so as they have key leaders in executive positions that are appropriately steering the teams in the right direction. They challenge you and continue to push your limits, striving to weed out the best of the best. I agree with this approach 100%.

However, the many many layers from France, to NA c-level, to division heads, to brand heads, to specific department leaders, convolutes messaging, approvals and more importantly, direction. There was also (unsure if still currently) a picking of sides within the org, to determine if your voice would be heard: side 1: follow existing protocol, business as usual, if things go array, follow the current path and don’t challenge or question. Side 2: innovate, think outside the box, challenge why things were done a certain way to see if there is an improved alternative. There was a very small contingent supporting side 2, which was great, to a point when it was supported by senior stakeholders (senior being key). However, with internal changes, you lose the support of those willing to innovate and an overwhelming support for keeping things business as usual. I went through 3 bosses over 6 months and no one bothered to question. I even asked 1 of said bosses after a meeting that I want to know that I have your support in a meeting if there is a difference of opinion and I was told verbatim “you have to navigate the room and play the audience, if you feel them siding one way, you too have to go that way.” I saw this first hand thereafter in followup meetings where we previously aligned on one direction but when a superior questioned, the entire room abandoned the initial direction to support said superior’s comment. I stuck with it but felt I was alone on an island which changed my whole perspective in the ways of working. 

Reacting to competitors and others in the marketplace unfortunately was a constant, versus initiating and piloting. Hopefully things have changed since but as the #1 beauty player in the world, I would expect calculated risks being part of a global strategy. 

Overall, I’m glad and appreciative of my time here and wouldn’t do it any other way as it made me who I am today. However, a fair psa to incoming talent, to manage expectations, you will be pushed but will be better for you in the long run. To management, please embrace change and new ways of thinking, perhaps challenge ways of working for sake of complacency.
Pros: Pay scale, bonus, benefits and facility. Challenging work (which is a benefit in my eyes), being part of a global, #1 beauty player company, across a multi channel structure, which will open many different perspectives as this is atypical from your standard retailer. Confrontation is collaboration. Survival of the fit.

Cons: Way of working not efficient, systems are very antiquated and not used properly, little guidance on certain streams and teams.
Advice: None
Pros: Great discount on products, good people, work is not stressful

Pros: Passione and carrer driven people
Inspiring culture
Good learning and development team/ really good trainings

Cons: From what I heard, other divisions are okay but luxury department is really the worst, please rethink if you want to join. The work is all over the place and more often not aligned with your scope, they promise it will get better but only becomes worse because there’s people quitting almost every other month. Managers do not know how to lead and not communicate any changes in direction, until the very last minute which makes it very hard to carry out tasks, and only blame you because you’re not “agile enough”. The higher ups only have their own selfish agendas to push, take credit and provides no visibility. 

They say to encourage you to report anything unethical but after you do, you’re not shielded and higher ups/HR will make your life even more difficult or even target you on professional setting. Be warned to always protect yourself even to your own manager or HR, in any form of communication because it will be used against you.
Advice: Stop favouring people just because they have been in the company for so long. If so many employees are quitting under the same manager, look into it seriously because there’s so much lost talent because of this.

Advice: None
Pros: Good culture, young, cool brands

Cons: All the horror stories you have heard about working for Loreal are true. Very poor onboarding and training with little to no support. Workloads are insanely high with poor work life balance leading to burnout with lots of people suffering with negative mental health issues but are scared to speak out due to fear of dictatorial leaders. Very hierarchical with chaotic and unorganised structures and processes. There is a facade of wellbeing with no actions put in place to protect staff. The company culture is dense, unwelcoming and highly confusing for anyone entering externally. I would not recommend working for Loreal you are a gluton for punishment, humiliation and stress.
Advice: Invest in proper onboarding and be more transparent regarding the company culture and extremely hierarchal  structure . Stop putting hardworking teams under constant unyielding stress.

Cons: Where do I begin? Unless you're a straight white Eton boy, don't bother. You will only get places at loreal if you have done the grad scheme and to get onto to grad scheme you need to have completed an essentially unpaid internship - which in London is only possible if your family have money and therefore rules out a whole bunch of demographics.
On top of this, you will not go far if you don't kiss bums of those higher up and shovel flour up your nose with them at the Christmas party.
Basically if you're working class or a person of colour, don't do it to yourself, it is NOT 'worth it'

Advice: Make sure to make an effort with interns and form a bond, helping them keep track of all their progress especially from the start of placement  as working in a big company can be overwhelming and guidance would beneficial especially within the first few weeks.
Pros: L’Oréal was a great place for an internship as i got responsibility quite early on, I was able to develop skills quickly and it helped me learn to adapt to the work place after 2 years of University in lock down.

Pros: The team depends on the division and function you get to. Nevertheless, all the divisions that I had to work in were friendly, understanding and encouraging. The company has a great employer-oriented policy.

At the moment
Advice: None
Pros: Nice environment and culture to work

Cons: Toxic culture coming from above. Senior managers in constant fear passing this down to their direct reports. Beware the under pressure General Manager who needs to divert attention from their numbers being down and diverting attention on junior members of staff in online for not doing more to bridge their finance gaps. L'Oreal's growth is driven by acquiring brands which they don't integrate, so as an Account Manager you're dealing with numerous ops, finance and marketing teams. 
Product launch dates mostly missed, so best laid plans to agree client marketing with no stock = nightmare.
This is a truly nasty place to work, unless of course you're a highly ambitious, cut-throat sociopath, then you'll probably be ok.
Advice: Review staff daily workflow to witness increased workload created by inefficiencies. Also, someone should look into how much money this company loses due to poor management of promotional pricing and ambitious/greedy staff lining their own pockets/getting promoted on the back of high sales with tiny gross profit.

My manager don't even help me move across function even other senior manager offer me a position  but verbally and using interpersonal languages to pushing me out by throwing me in the bus in front of my employee for times before I could explain the situation. Very little coaching on the job.
