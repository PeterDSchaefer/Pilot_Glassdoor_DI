Pros: Great Team Support. Excellent Manager.

Cons: Every single thing was bad about this company, Forcing each and every individual to work OT without paying for it. Discrimination at its finest to certain people, too much work politics. If you get stuck with a manager that micromanages you and has a personal vendetta against you, best of luck. You can count with a single hand on how many people are actually friendly to you. People are downright hostile the second you put your foot down on refusing to do work that isnt in your job description or contract. HR doesn't care nor help - only pretends. You will find that some people are not even coming in to work on a daily basis but they insist everyone needs to do so. 

Was a day where there was only 3 people in the office, everyone was slacking off while I hustled alone doing work. Outrageous. The stress is crazy. People come and go but I've seen many that resigned due to being unable to keep up with the stress that management gives to the people.
Advice: Fix your mindset and issues. Look around the office and actually think about it. Stop overworking people and forcing people to do jobs that are outside working hours and not within their job description. Treat people fairly, stop being passive aggressive, stop isolating people, stop discriminating people, stop the unnecessary office politics.
Pros: None. Maybe pantry of food and free drinks from time to time.

Cons: It's a big company so things move a little slower. 
This can be an issue depending on what you are looking for.
Advice: None
Pros: Colleagues are very helpful and there are many opportunities to learn from a lot of smart people in the company.

Cons: Although English is the working language, but understanding Swedish is very helpful.
Advice: None
Pros: 1. Nice working environment.
2. You are encourage tod work inovatively.

Cons: The promotion of people is based on the years of them in the company rather than in their capabilities. There have been very disappointing promotions over the years I’ve been in the company that have no explanation but nepotism. Instead of value the people by their potential they prefer mediocre employees to be in roles as Seniors or Managers, only cause they were in the “waiting queue” longer, building no trust or leadership among the teams. Generating frustration over the high performance employees how truly deserve the positions, ending in their leave of the company. It’s a shame. 
Besides, HR is not approachable at all and it’s the department with less soft skills among all the company 
The salaries and benefits package is not the best, each time employees raise their concern about salary increases due to inflation they said it’s “included” in the performance review which is of 2 or 5% for all the year. 
There are periodic surveys to qualify the performance of the company that have no sense as Management and HR don’t take action in the matters that people highlight.
Advice: Pay attention in who you promote, you will end up having a full mediocre management staff that will not lead the company to their next level or success. Besides, truly heard people’s concerns and that action in a timely manner

Advice: Create better leadership, my experience is that a lot of managers get promoted without having the right skills.

* kind colleagues

Cons: One area for improvement is the feedback process. While the work environment is generally positive, there could be more valuable feedback from managers to help employees understand their performance, areas for growth, and how they can contribute more effectively to the team's goals.
Advice: To create a better work environment, management should understand and respect the diverse cultural backgrounds of its employees. Different countries have unique ways of giving and receiving feedback, so it's important to be sensitive to these differences. By acknowledging cultural diversity, management can implement approaches that accommodate various feedback styles. This might involve providing training to help managers communicate effectively across cultures and fostering an environment where all employees feel valued and heard. Embracing diversity not only enriches the workplace but also strengthens teamwork and encourages innovation. 
Pros: thoroughly enjoyed my time working at that team/company. The company fostered a positive and supportive environment that encouraged collaboration and innovation. It was refreshing to be part of a team where mutual respect and teamwork were valued, making every day a rewarding experience
