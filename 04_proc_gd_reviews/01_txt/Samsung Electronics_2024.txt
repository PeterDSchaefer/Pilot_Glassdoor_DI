Advice: hire competent people
Pros: they pay well and good benefits

Cons: Micromanagement
Paying women less than male counterparts (ITS SHOCKING WHY HAVENT JPURNALISTS LOOK INTO - women anre treated like dirt and they are systematically not promoting them.  Samsung will not do accommodations if you have a disability.  and It will probably end your employment there if you do so.  Please don’t work there. It destroyed my career. 
Advice: You need a better HR department because they would be SCREAMING into the phone trying to get me to quit while my son was having an MRI.  I’m a great engineer and had a stellar record.  I hope things have changed but I doubt it.  The pay difference between men and women for even the woman doing more work was shocking.

Cons: Most toxic working environemnt Untrustworthy leadership, teams that are only out for themselves, willing to backstab anyone to try and take credit for tasks or projects. Systems and technology are beyond subpar using outdated laptops, Microsoft products from 2014 and 2016, with any new opportunities to enhance systems immediately denied.
Long, thankless hours and completely unreasonable expectations are the norm.
No one is allowed to actually succeed or truly grow and bonuses are all based on a quota system no matter how well you perform.
If you love being the scapegoat for poor management, lack or any type of clear guidelines, and a delusional Korean HQ, you will thrive at Samsung

Pressure to Perform: The competitive nature of the industry may create pressure to consistently deliver results, potentially impacting work-life balance.

Limited Control Over Schedule: Depending on the role, employees may have limited control over their schedules, which can make it harder to achieve a desired work-life balance.

Crossing Time Zones: If the role involves global responsibilities, there may be challenges in managing work hours across different time zones, affecting personal time.

Work-Life Balance: Due to the demanding nature of the job, maintaining a work-life balance was challenging at times. Long working hours were often required to meet project deadlines and achieve goals.

Organizational Hierarchy: The company's large size and complex organizational structure sometimes made decision-making processes slow. Navigating through the hierarchy to implement changes or get approvals could be time-consuming.

Cons: This review considate a few common feedback by peers who left. The department is toxic due to the head (G****l). 
Scolding, gaslighting is a norm.
Top management tried to prohibit such behavior, but ended up only moving occurrence from public to slightly secluded area.

Poor career path as higher position normally held by korean. 

The subsidiary culture is inclined to pleasing management to HQ. New project launch each year just for the sake of reporting and KPI. management will highly focus on the project when it is 'seen' by HQ. Previous in progress projects will be neglected, and the person who handles the project will suffer. 

As I didn't work in another department, these comments are only applicable to innovation teams in SME .But the turnover is high as a whole subsidiary.
Advice: Look into high turnover department, give proper training for the head, or assign someone who are actually capable.
Pros: Good colleague. But most of them left.

Cons: Toxic workplace
Creates stress and anxiety 
Some run around the office like their lives depend on it - amusing but ridiculous! 
Zero work/life balance
Directors expected to work 6 day week (see the news articles on this one!) 
Employees expendable
50% of workforce are contractors - and that means zero sick pay or benefits unlike the chosen 50%

Subsidised food and Starbucks coffee

Cons: - Terrible local management. Yelling, screaming and passive aggression are normal and to be expected. 
- Micromanagement is a standard. You should do what you are told to do, but when that does not work - it’s your fault.
- All the rumors about local Samsung are true.
- Aside from bonuses, you get no benefits. You have to pay participation for health insurance, and there is nothing else. 
- I’m not sure if anyone used their vacations days (bare minimum of 20), you should be grateful you are using any at all.
Advice: Advice is for HR to do their job. It is unbelievable how the bounce rate in some teams is super high and no one is doing anything.

Advice: Teleperformance is a good company to start. but please take care of health of the employees. 
Pros: easy and helpful environment. trainer was very supportive

Cons: One of the most toxic cultures I worked in. Colleagues and managers were emotionally burnt out, which was very draining. Bad and toxic behaviours are tolerated, especially from high management. I have seen countless people having to take sick leave from being over-worked.
The main issue is cultural, which comes from the Head Quarters in Korea. Their priority is NOT people or employees, even if they state it in their company values. All they care is about financial results, and squeezing every inch of blood and energy someone has to give. Additionally, there's no diversity at all. 90% of senior leaders are male, either Korean or white. This doesn't improve much in mid-management.
Don't be fooled by the name or by a high paycheck, and avoid yourself hours of therapy, anxiety and bad health. Stay away from Samsung.

Cons: **Review: Avoid This Company**

Working at this company has been a frustrating and stressful experience. The direction changes every week, leading to confusion and a lack of clear goals. The high-pressure environment makes it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Moreover, the Korean boss is extremely bossy and often micromanages tasks, which adds to the already tense atmosphere. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a stable and supportive work environment.
Advice: None
Pros: Salary is relatively high compared to other companies. Welfare and insurance is good

Cons: This is a terrible company to work for. They have recently resumed hiring and I feel compelled to warn people. If you intend on applying for a role in the 80 Strand London/Chertsey office please be warned that this is a toxic work environment. Do not be fooled by the pay package. Be prepared to be berated, yelled at and receive nasty emails from management. This is not restricted to just one team but is across the entire operations. The Koreans are treated like Gods and there is no room to share ideas or be innovative. Lots of gaslighting from upper management, they'll constantly keep picking on people till it breaks them down. Managers do not shy away from yelling at a team member in front of an entire team, we have also had managers concocting bad performance reviews to bully people into not speaking up. To sum up, you're giving your soul and dignity for the high pay package. They treat their staff like slaves, and you'll have to endure emotional abuse and bullying.
Advice: Stop hiding in your glassdoor cubicle. Have 121s with the people in your wider department to understand what is going on. Stop burying your head in the sand. Treat your staff with dignity.

Advice: None
Pros: Discounts for samsung products are good

Cons: depanding culture, very korean oriented
Advice: None
Pros: great company to have on your resume

Cons: - Korean culture permeates, and it's not a good one. Lots of hierarchy and sadly, even if the Koreans have no idea of what they're doing, they rather continue down the wrong path than to admit that they're in the wrong and lose face so things are usually slow and painful.
- Very rarely does one get positive feedback. It's like being in a hamster wheel, they keep asking for more and more (even if the expectations are completely ridiculous) without any concrete guidance, honestly, I've never been in a job with such little guidance but such massive negative feedback, the word is failure. 
- Don't bother in trying to go above and beyond because when it comes to providing you a score for your PEs or PBPs, you'll always get a "meets most". I've actually been asked to write impossible results that would match up to higher scores on your evaluations so it's essentially impossible to exceed around here. If you do exceed and is proven, higher management will still lower your scores without giving you any explanation except for the fact that "not everyone can get high scores, only some".
- When they tell you to do something, they're not asking, they're ordering you to do so. I feel like I'm back in school where my every move is meticulously tracker - where I am, what I'm doing, when am I going to be in the office. 
- Terrible flexible working policies. I was asked to get a therapist to evaluate me in order to get them to understand that I needed more flexible working. I had to disclose extremely private matters about my personal life in order to justify that. I ended up feeling naked and vulnerable. Even after that, they're still asking me to come in above and beyond what my max days in the office are and they completely forgot that I have an exception because of my mental health. If you don't come in, they ask you to compensate by coming in another day but when you've been more days in that your usual days, you're not allowed to ask them for the same.
- Zero work-life balance. Honestly, I get emails from managers on Sundays, it's borderline ridiculous.
- No competent people across some divisions, some people lack the right experience to understand about specific industries but they're still leading teams across those divisions with no idea of what they're doing and relying on their team to fix things for them and avoid looking bad to the Koreans.
- They make you come into the office (and track it) but you spend most of your time on your own, talking to no one. That's their idea of collaboration.
- I constantly feel scared for my job and very anxious and there really is no one to talk to, you talk to other people in the team and they're all feeling the same way. Super demoralising.
- Tech is one of the worst ones I've seen. It is an electronics manufacturer, yes, but their IT systems are a total nightmare. Because they don't trust their employees, they put a ton of firewall and security systems on the laptops that make them 100 times more slower, you can't access some websites that are required for your job on certain networks, so you have to disconnect, hotspot from your phone to open the website and back to the network. They even started putting security stickers on laptops to make sure that you haven't tampered with the hardware. Oh, and that work phone they give you doesn't allow you to do much except for reading emails and sending messages. You also cannot access your email from anywhere except for a Samsung computer or your work phone and don't get me started on your diary - there is no way to see your diary if you don't have your computer with you so you have to memorise it.
Advice: Stop trying to micromanage, stop trying to pretend like you know it all and listen to your colleagues. We're all adults, we don't need to let you know what we're doing every five minutes or when we're in the office. If the job is getting done, great. Not everything is money so no matter how much more money you want to pay your employees, if the culture is bad, they'll want to eventually leave. My mental health has severely deteriorated since I joined Samsung so I will leave as soon as I manage to find another job that I'm happy with.
Pros: The compensation package is great - high salary, good additional benefits, employee discounts, etc., good pay reviews too.
