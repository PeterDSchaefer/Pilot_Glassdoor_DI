Cons: Terrible hours. HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE LEADERSHIP. Stohlman service managers create a hostile work environment and verbally assault their employees (LAWSUIT TIME-BOMB). Cost-cutting and profit-bloating rampant. They hire and fire weekly. I remember constantly training new hires, only to watch them leave a few months, or weeks, later. My schedule changed on average every 6 weeks, etc, etc, etc....
Advice: Mrs. Stohlman, Mr. Reznek,
I advise you audit your service department. I implore you to create a better environment for your service employees.
I have used Stohlman Automotive as a good example of a bad example, in my own business endeavors and discussions. My experience with Stohlman Automotive engraved in me memories of the worst work environment I have ever had. How many more of me are there?
Also, use your product ;)
-Anyone who has worked for you
Pros: Wonderful sales staff, advisors and technicians. My coworkers were my friends. Good benefits. Great location.

Cons: The cons are most definitely the famine months of the winter.  Industry slows down, people drive less, and you get fewer cars in for repairs.  The dealership does nothing to mitigate this famine for the technician, because you are flat-rate.
Advice: Pay your techs better, they haven't gotten a raise (industry wide) since the 80's, but you require four times as much from them.
Pros: Working in the automotive field is not gravy by any measure.  There is a lot asked from the technician, and a lot of responsibility placed on his shoulders.  Volkswagen, pays slightly more than other brands, and the continuity between dealerships is pretty good.  Just be ready for a lot of feast or famine scenarios.

Cons: Extremely difficult to get time off, especially on weekends - also mandatory long shifts such as at least one 12 hour day per week, no overtime, and commissions may be based on surveys from sales and service customers. Also, Volkswagen currently does not have a 3rd row vehicle, and they typically are a more expensive vehicle with less features than most competitors
Advice: Better hours and more flexibility for time off - sales reps gets stressed out from long days, long weeks, and extremely little time off
Pros: Volkswagen offers a high - quality product with a fantastic variety of turbo-diesel and turbo-gas vehicles, including the awesome SportWagen. VW also has a great offering for manual transmissions.

Cons: Office space is lacking.  You share desks with other people.
Advice: Actually a pretty good management team.  They seem to care what you have to say and tend to take advice.  Keep on keeping on.
Pros: The dealership has many different jobs available at any given time.  I have been with them 4 years and have truly enjoyed working for them.  They also have the best ever Christmas Parties!!!!  Lunch is also provided on Saturday if you are scheduled to work.  Sales people also recently went to a salary plus bonus program, it makes life so much easier not to only work of commissions.

Cons: There is favoritism from management.  There are cliques. Pay is low regardless of the effort and time you put in. There is no upward mobility. Language is crass. Management doesn't know how to manage . Management is constantly hiring unqualified people who they promote before existing staff. And work hours are terrible. If you have no life outside of work then this place is perfect.
Advice: Invest more time training existing staff and providing more opportunities to grow. And throw all personal favoritism out the window
Pros: They try to work with your schedule. The building is state of the art. The customers are such lovers of vw they make your day.

Cons: It is a very traditional company with high hierarchies. A lot of interns are hired, more than I've ever seen in any other company before. Also their wages were below what I have experienced at other companies and not many of the interns are actually hired after their internship.
Advice: None
Pros: If you're passionate about cars, then that's one of the companies to go to. You might get an opportunity to improve or change future cars. They take care of the workers rights, like a regulated working week and enough holidays. My tasks were interesting and I was challenged, so I have learned a lot when I left the company.

Cons: As a German company it seems they only hire germans for high tier positions even in North American operations, unrealistic goals at times, there is a sort of 'drink the koolaid' cult vibe with some of the more extreme VW enthusiasts that work there, during the soccer world cup no work gets done as everyone is too busy watching the game in the break room
Advice: Get realistic goals, avoid putting your employees down in meetings and other than all of that just go ahead and keep up the good work.
Pros: Easy hours, decent pay, managers are knowledgable to some extent, very good work environment

Cons: Very stressful on employee’s, management watches your every move, like to micro manage in some areas. Way to hard on people, then don’t treat others the same based on skin color.
Advice: Stop hiring 20 year olds that cheated through college to run the plant. Hire from the shop floor, or otherwise put all new office hires into a 6 month shop floor training experience, making them work pitches, deal with down time, daily OT
Pros: Good pay, benefits, and work environment.

Cons: The Volkswagen India plant is although a high tech plant but it still is a manual plant and does not have the latest technology in use for production.
Advice: Investment in new equipment will greatly boost production figures. Developing products according to the market you are targetting will go a long way in increasing the brand value.
Pros: One of the best automotive industries with very high production figures. High tech equipment and a lot to learn. Especially about process design and optimization.

Cons: Large company processes and politics from Germany.  This bogs the ERL of VW down and prevents us from being competitive in an extremely competitive environment.
Advice: Upper management can provide better direction and  do some of the creating and idea generation themselves.
Pros: The people that work here are great, and it is probably one of the lower stress and time commitment jobs in SV.

Cons: Terrible leadership that doesn't really care
Advice: None

Cons: strong rules,principles,low speed,low salary growing
Advice: None
Pros: best employee，integrity, we together，inovation customers first,

Cons: The culture is very hierarchal and the management does not plan strategically at all. We have foreign managers in every two to three years, so there is no consistency or organizational investment. They are usually out for themselves and their next promotion. Also, the morale is poor because our hourly employees work a ton of overtime. Also, it is a bus driver environment, where folks will run you over and back the bus up.
Advice: Stop band-aiding issues and figure out the root cause. At executive level management--Let an American lead the company and give them freedom. Also, appreciate innovative ideas--and stop making last minute decisions. Management needs to encourage others to take accountability and ownership of mistakes. Also, be open to change.
Pros: Volkswagen pays very well and the bonus is pretty awesome. My management is very good, but is the rarity within the organization. Volkswagen offers many training and development opportunities.

Cons: Frequently promise pay raises/bonuses but without any follow through
majority of people are contractors and it is difficult to become a direct hire
Constantly have more and more work added to your plate, but without any sort of additional compensation or added team members
Advice: None
Pros: Strong brand name
Good office location
Possibilities for career advancement

Cons: Usually have to be willing to move for career growth

Cons: Hardly any family time, hard time to move up in the company, pay doesn’t match cost of living changes, etc.

Advice: None
Pros: Growing business. Experience with any company is not always the whole story, perception is in the eye of the beholder.

Advice: stop hiring idiots who capped out in high school be in charge cause most of the time their disrespectful bullies who are costing your company customers but blaming their underlings
Pros: great pay/laid back work when management absent

Cons: No appreciation for the real team player, always being watched , even after seeing and acknowledging that the job is being done better than expected. Favorites among the supervisors and employees.
Advice: Treat people according to their performance, not personality. Allow advancement, reward achievement, show understanding , and BE FAIR. Please, thank you.
Pros: Factory, fast paced team work. Incentive for being on time and at work every work day, and a on site workout spot.

Cons: I was advised I would be able to move through positions quickly and increase my rate as I went. I am now in my third position and my rate has not increased at all.
Advice: Be more up front about the opportunities that are available to the worker.
Pros: The people are fantastic to work with and the company is genuine in its caring for the customer.

Cons: Poor pay. Mid and lower level employees have been punished or let go due to high-level VW decisions like the diesel scandal. I left after the revelations of the diesel scandal broke because I did not want to work at a firm that intentionally lied to consumers and regulators for years. VW had the arrogance to use the slogan 'German Engineering' -- as if that meant something -- when in reality the engineering teams were cheating on emissions because they could not engineer better diesels.
Advice: Take full responsibility for 'Dieselgate' and don't take it out on your thousands of mid- and lower-level employees
Pros: Decent benefits and pleasant coworkers.

Cons: They treat their employees like dirt! Cuss out the employees and punish them by making employees work on their off days. They raise hell if customers choose to go elsewhere, not come back in, buy a vehicle or leave after just browsing as if it’s in the employees control to stop a customer or force them to buy a car! Upper management just sits around yelling at employees all day long if sales aren’t coming in. It’s just ridiculous how the owner of this dealership allows this type of behavior to go on when the real problem is their own judgement of who manages their store! One manager steals other teams deals and puts his name on it to make himself look good and tries to save himself while throwing others under the bus. If they aren’t firing people, people are quitting all of the time because of the disrespectful ways they treat people then expect employees to be happy there and be happy serving customers! Employees barely can take 5 minutes to chew a bite of their lunch! They say this is a THRIVING location but there’s a HUGE difference between THRIVING and slaving your employees. Labor Law Attorney is coming their way pretty soon! I would never recommend this place to anyone- customers or employees! How do you expect to have a solid team to make sales for your business if all you do is treat them like slaves!? If any changes need to be made it’s ownership and selection of management!
Advice: Forget management! The owner needs to get involved! Look at who has been managing your store for a while now and start with making changes there before you try to fire people that put in all of their time and hard work at your dealership! It’s ridiculous that all of your employees feel unappreciated and worked like slaves because your management has anger problems and cusses people out every 5 seconds!
Pros: None! This place is horrible and I don’t recommend anyone to even apply here unless you’re ok with making no sales and getting cussed out! Literally. It has been poor management here for a while now and it’s not getting any better because the owner keeps the same problems managers!

Cons: a little more emphasis is given on quality, quality week etc.
Advice: The extra money spent in sending out quality messages can be utilized for something else
Pros: New/ advanced technology, every employee is treated as same, wide exposure to different fields, encouragement is provided to employee, interesting events are organized to keep employees engaged.

Advice: Go back to 4 day work week.  Stop paying the advisor based off surveys
Pros: The potential to make good money is available as an advisor.

Good work life balance.

Cons: The pay was really below industry standard, the workload, at points, was insane, a lot of extra hours were needed to keep the head above water (which I wouldn't have minded if the pay was where it should be) In order to keep costs low many people are hired as externs so couldn't avail of many of the same benefits as other employees. Massive emphasis on cost saving exercises mean that it's impossible to get a rise (even when you're doing well at work) therefore experienced people tend to leave and are often replaced with graduates with little to no experience. Benefits are poor (no health insurance, have to buy your own coffee at a mark-up, no snacks, no social clubs, few nights out) - an unusual "bake or buy" syndicate which one person was selected to buy food for everyone in the office (not ideal the Friday before payday) I remember being told that being able to say you work for "Brand X" was one of the benefits of the job there - madness!
Advice: - Work on hiring talent and growing it - A relentless focus on the bottom line makes it feel like a constant race to the bottom
Pros: The cars are nice and you get to drive them sometimes, the people are mostly good esp the people on the ground, If you are just starting in your career VWGI is good place to build experience

Siloed thinking occasionally hindered the flow of information, resulting in missed opportunities to leverage collective expertise effectively. - Lack of employee engagement in certain projects.

Advice: None
Pros: Volkwagen is a company that believes in improving people through learning and it also encourages graduates to take on leadership roles

Cons: It's a big ship that steers slowly, be prepared to bury some of your projects or things that you put work into. (You can utilize this in reducing your own stress while working, as you can guess after some time which things will never make it out of the drawing room) The "System Wolfsburg" is real. Be prepared for political games and network accordingly. Hard to get into a management position through the internal way. If you have the chance to enter management positions while coming from another employer take it.

There is a relatively high rotation of top management due to the VW Group philosophy of management rotation, which brings a certain amount of organizational instability and some limitation of developing organizational knowledge.
Advice: None
Pros: Volkswagen China Investment Co. Ltd (VCIC) is a good employer that provides good terms to employees. As in many companies in China, foreign employees might get better terms due to a more limited access to national supporting systems that are available to local employees.

Advice: None
Pros: good working climate, good manager

Cons: Awful culture - there's a thin veneer of inclusivity here. And to a degree it's true - they don't care who you are or where you're from - you'll all be bullied just the same! I used to be a big VW fan, and when the opportunity came to work here it was like a dream come true - which then turned into a mental nightmare. Not only would I never step foot in the place again, but I'd recommend avoiding it. And I no longer buy the products they sell. If you enjoy stabbing people in the back then this is the place for you, but if you're human - avoid it like the plague!
Advice: I doubt very much they'd even listen. Perhaps the toxicity is middle management?? Maybe spend some time at the coal face and really get to know what's going on - if that's not beneath you? Action not false promises. You have a lot to do to earn the true of customers and employees - failure here will see the end of you, particularly as the likes of Tesla and the Chinese makers are taking big chunks out of you. People first!!

Cons: Worst place for a Software Engineer to make any kind of career. Every single department is a disaster, ego tripping everywhere, everyone is trying to reach the end of the month to get their salaries for the next one. No one has any idea how to make software, they think that's like making a car, it doesn't work this way.

No one can't be fired, this is a nest of incompetence.
Advice: Fire incompetent people and take some time to make some reflection about yourselves. Whatever decision you are going to take soon, doing taking this in mind, do actual people have the competence to "Drive the future of mobility"? If not... fire them. This whole situation is contraproducent for the goals of the company, this many external companies... they's no accountability, ownership for anything we do, the daily job is reduced to a game of blaming others. It's just a big hierarchical structure, where everyone is blaming and fingerpointing each other for their mistakes instead of working as a team towards a common goal, this mindset percolates even in small departments and even amongst team members, or teams.
Pros: Stability, pension, the workers council will make sure to make you stay (although this is bad, as incompetent people will always stay)

Cons: Bureaucracy, corporate culture and slow processes.
Advice: None
Pros: International culture, good people, and interesting industry.

Cons: Terrible work environment with no social atmosphere. Remuneration was poor.
Advice: None
Pros: Exposure to great experience working with business leaders.

Cons: Long hours and challenging targets
Advice: None
Pros: Good commission and nice cars

Cons: Not busy = means that it is really quite boring, and not just for my position either the sales team are equally as bored.

Where to start?
• Poor training, had no idea what was going on for the majority of my employment and therefore I didnt learn anything to help me develop any skills.
•Lack of communication between all the departments, leads to a lot of confusion
•Manager was way too passive aggressive 
•The Sales team were quite good at returning calls, however some members of the service team just dont care (I dont blame them) but the consequences are that customers get angry at le receptionist. (Which reminder, wasnt trained for)
•Diversity is probably good, the other employees had low key racist comments or discriminatory comments to certain races etc.

Additional meh things:
•The layout of the place made it very hard to see things and do my job
•Update employee areas please, the toilets were horrible, the kitchen was just grim and had very basic things, just a kettle actually
•You would think for a multi million or billion company they would provide more for the staff like lunch, better utilities, even caring and that's free
•Sick isnt paid which is just stupid 

Probably a lot more, but my experience is mine alone. I wouldn't recommend working here in the dealerships as they are quite boring, high pressure, confused management and bad work/life balance.
Advice: Be better.
Pros: Not a busy environment which is both a pro and con*

Cons: Will not be given any meaningful work or work at all. Most of the day in spent day dreaming. HR  and payroll is not transparent at all and attempts to conceal information from you. Extremely boring and worthless internship unless, you want to experience living in Japan. Almost all other interns will be people that major in  Asian Studies  with no knowledge on Business or Economics/the automotive industry. No "native" English speakers, most employees 98% of employees are either German or Japanese. So, if your Japanese is not very good, it will be a difficult experience. Toyohashi is an extremely boring part of Japan and if given the option, goto Tokyo. Although, your salary will not go very far in Tokyo. It will be 100% better than frequenting the same 3 bars that close at 11pm every weekend.
Advice: Don't needlessly hire interns. If there isn't a project or assignments for them, don't hire them.
Pros: Get to live in Japan
Respectful Colleges
Job offer likely with successful internship
No drug test
Paid(Most internships in Japan are unpaid or extremely low-paid compared)
They will find you housing if you work/live in Toyohashi.

Cons: Unfortunately i would say that the hiring policy is very strict and depends on your top managers if they heard about you. Work hard and might have a change to be rewarded, knowing that a recommendation from the top managment in Volkswagen group is worth a lot if you apoly somwhere else.
Advice: Keep up the good job and the management you are following. It not uncommon to meet the president of the company and naturally says hi to you because he trully value his employees from interns to top management.
Pros: As your managers are all seniors they are just an awesome source of knowledge and inspiration. I think the management used in Volkswagen by some managers is just brillant as they try to put you at the best of your performance. you will participate all the travels and most the car dealer network visits and these kind of things. Today I can say that I gained in maturity and changed a part of how I was working. Also the end of the months is an exciting moment to live in the automotive industry.

Cons: There are 20% old fashioned macho types which still have the old german mentality (from before 1979) which think women are below them. These discriminating bullies are still around, also destructive people from the old management culture, which brought the company to its knees, and with their attitude they destroy the team spirit and demotivate the surrounding team. When these people are managers, they are there for their own gain; they change the position a lot. Although there are also good ones who care for their employees.
Advice: Telling the press that the old culture is being changed, and making cool shows with famous people, doesn't change the fact, that the old culture is still there. Ensuring that the old-mentality managers do not get important positions would be one step ahead. It is not serious and makes no good impression to the outside world to make a top manager responsible for software engineering who has very little clue about software engineering.
Pros: Remote office work possible. Very family friendly. Most of colleagues in Germany are very good colleagues. Very strong workers' union.

Cons: You manage your career alone, and explore new opportunities under covert. The HR system doesn't work although they claim for 'best employer' program. Promotions are very rare. You are promoted from outside. From inside promotion doesn't work and you have to do lots of  politics.
Advice: Walk the talk and o objective review of career path and be honest about skills and potentials. If negative opinion on promotions then give true and objective guidance on how to improve, and make it part of the regular (quarterly( follow up. Check also with skip level meetings.
Pros: Different jobs, experiences, areas. Moving from one to another area is quite easy if you are a people person and skilled in what you do. Company has international and growing business. Opportunities may help you land on other parts of the planet if you want (and can).

Cons: POLITICS, blocking promotions based on current requirement, salary does not compare (from what I have investigated), dictation, disrespect for staff and 'those not in the circle of influence', Inability to implement / make decisions. Buddy system of staff, no consequences for failure, no recognition for success. Clocking in and out system, time sheets monitored, no freedom without permission at every turn. Regardless of how hard you work / what you do / what you have done to get there - you are all treated - and mostly paid - the same.
Advice: Set feasible KPI's, that when met should be recognised and form a base for salary / base, take the time to talk to your staff and find out what they are doing, promotions should be based on merit and what can be proven - not whims.
Pros: The car, quarterly bonus, 13th cheque, job security, uniform saves.

Cons: Rigid culture

Advice: None
Pros: Strong capital owned
Nice working environment

Cons: Manager very old mind fashion
Advice: Update yourself, study, not be badass
Pros: Benefits. Rental car. Christmas bonus. Profit shares.

Cons: The company desperately wants to grow at all costs ....at all costs! The attitude is that anything is able to be overcome with money and that means all resources are funnelled into paying for discounting cars or pushing more and more equipment into them to make them appealing enough to overcome buyer resistance to issues that are surfacing about quality and reliability. Staff turnover is high in some departments due to very poor management.
Advice: Dont pretend to care about your customers or staff, actually care enough and respect that they are valuable. Selling more cars is not going to solve the problems in the brand or at the dealerships.
Pros: Really good products and people who are completely committed to the brand despite not all being well below the surface.
Good pay and conditions but terrible location.

Cons: Too much bureaucracy and controls slow down anything you have to do to cope with competition actions in the market.

Everything needs to be reported and decided in HQ in Germany. Germans don't believe in Brazilians knowledge of the market.

Excessive agreements with employee's unions does not let you dismiss bad employees, making the management even more hostage of a bad management situation than in similar companies.
Advice: You must fight the excess of meetings and implement a 360º evaluation of all management AND employees. The market is for the fast ones, not to the slow ones.

Try to dismount each department feud.

Try to not change the whole VP level every three years, because this leads the company to not face and solve long term problems.
Pros: Good bonus and new cars every year.

Cons: Bad communication from top to bottom
Management placed on a pedestal
Lack of career opportunities
Lack of career planning
Lack of responsibility for people on the floor
Lack of health and safety awareness
Advice: Volkswagen wants to implement Toyota concepts to their processes, but this can only be done once management is seen as part of the team and not placed on a pedestal. Look at Toyota's management concept. Communication needs to be improved from top to bottom and with people having more of a input in the day to day decisions.  People also need the opportunity for guidance for a career plan. Maybe spend as much time on their people as they do on their product's quality. People need to feel save and valued at work.
Pros: Good quality product
Pride in the product
Salaries are competitive
Good team spirit
Good quality equipment 
Up to date with technology

Cons: Like isolated region, top management seems arrogant for Local people, making business plans for his own career, selfishness. Connection between HQ and korea is not communicated very well, I don’t know why. We need secret inspectors to review all directors of NSC. They don’t see long term strategy but see short term plans for his personal career.
Advice: Because of your(top management) political arguments in Korea, local people are getting loose strong motivation to work and to see further actions. Hello VW HQ!! Please send us inspectors and re-check the organization. As long as I see, local people want to do for their future and everything. Please set this organization for more healthy and futuristic.
Pros: Usual benefit programs. Name value from brand power.

Cons: No true people managers, only target obsessed types with no knowledge of teams jobs, processes, or people's skills. V fast paced, overly complex processes and systems, cumbersome working practices, and the most over the top interview format for jobs that are all much of a muchness. Anyone would think they are carrying out vetting for CIA the length and gruelling nature of their interview processes - when they are generally all pretty similar admin jobs. 
Day job - expect to encounter old fashioned business processes, and expect a fierce blame culture.
Advice: Start recruiting true people mangers - with people skills.
Pros: Car ownership schemes are handy if you are without wheels.

Cons: To reach a higher positioin you must be german, mexicans and others take too long to reach a higher position because in my experience the CEO and the other chiefs are germans.They also make you work saturdays and sundays if necessary.
Advice: Try to get more points and really helpful courses for the especialist according they necessities but also they schedule.
Pros: You can find anyplace to work in your interest areas, they have really good benefits as some clothes cupons at sears and other stores also they help you to rent a car from the brand.

Cons: Some brands have a toxic work environment with a blame culture - no sense of team
Career progression is difficult, it all about timing
A lot of great employees are unmotivated 
There is a lot of internal politics, within the brands, and around the building
Advice: Listen to surveys carried out by employees. Keep staff motivated by setting defined projects, and potential career opportunities. Offer more flexible working hours, or potentially working from home one day a week.
Pros: Very friendly staff, everyone in the build is pleasant. Some brands more than others 
Great cars ownership scheme with access to cheap insurance
Great to learn about the industry quickly
Excellent pension &amp; health insurance options

Cons: Presenting a product to humans requires audacity and strategy, which can require enormous effort and investment.
Looking at the history of the world we realize that the simple is amazing, the detail is unique and exclusive.
Advice: Focus and value on employees is the largest requisition that a company.
Need high investment in experts and knowledge holders, are the soul of success!
Pros: Company Strong! Strong Values! It has the agility and the competence to launch in the world market, vehicles with high and excellent added value!
It has the tenacity of only with a single launch, have the power to create worldwide trends in technology and safety in vehicles around the world!

Cons: 1. There is lot of politics and favorism especially in interior and exterior department.
2. People are not open to teach you systems and process,they will try to prove that only they are masters and no one world is better than them.typically Bhosari MIDC people who got hired by there relatives or friends.
3. HR and management do not have any control over such attitude people.no ethics at all at work.
4. Work quality is nothing just act like postman between supplier and Skoda or VW headquarters.
5. No work life balance at all, buses reaches 7:00 am to office you will have to start 1 hour before at-least from home if you are living well within city.
6. Increment is just 5-6 % each year.
Advice: No advice as they are never in mood of listening
Pros: No as such apart from global level systems acess

Cons: Sometimes not the best place to be if you are not working in the headquarter office, once most of important decisions are taken according to a local point of view, putting aside some important cultural aspects abroad.
Advice: Internal values are important and are there to be used, the departments should be driven in a professional and ethic way and it must be understood that this is the best and only way to perform the work. Departments should not be seen as the backyard of private houses.
Pros: Solid company with factories all over the world and high technology oriented. Continuous searching for higher standards. Concerned about world wide environment.

Cons: Few opportunities of promotion. Men have advantage over women. As they have more employees than needed and no threats in the company, some professionals do not contribute while others work hard.
Advice: None
Pros: Stable company in a still growing market in LA, it is not a company who threats the employees. More associates in Brazil than needed, the work is not ver hard to everybody. Good salaries and defined time work. Invest in Marketing and Advertising.

Cons: -Low pay, no salary increase unless you're a suck-up. HR is not fair with benefits and pay.
-Lazy culture. No teamwork. They only work to get paid, but there's no passion, dedication to excel and help the company
-Rare that you'll get career growth
Advice: -Make better business decisions
-Hold people accountable who make mistakes because that will help the company
-Be fair with salaries and benefits. Especially benefits
Pros: -A subsidiary of an Ayala company
-A bit of the Ayala group of companies benefits
-Work-life balance

Cons: New in Indian market. Slow decision making. More process orientation sometimes brings with it less flexibility. Need to align HR standards in line with Indian corporates.
Advice: Fast decision making. Decentralized decision making. Keep going strive for excellence.quality which is core of our group makes us very proud.
Pros: Very structured and organized company. Process and system oriented.  Always strives quality& excellence. Focused towards bringing more & more transparency. Employee friendly company.

Cons: Do not join the group if you want to suffer !!!!! :D
Seriously not working here is a major con!!

Pros: It´s a very challenging career with lots of opportunities to shine and exposure of your job duties to internal  clients, most of them VIPs. Really customer oriented position,

Cons: Unfortunately they have a big problem with blame culture, people spend a lot of time trying to cover themselves instead of collaborate or work . The company is slightly behind compared to other large corporations, no working from home or flexibility culture. It’s up to the managers to decide how their team work. Some perceive that as too modern.

Pros: There is a good Company Car Scheme, you get a new car for family and friends every 6 months. It is a good workplace where you work with intelligent colleagues.

Cons: Terrible development
Awful HR
Management promise jobs to people before they are on the advertised wasting others time at interview
IF your face fits you will be fine, or a woman who entertains her male "boss"
Advice: Managing Directors need to watch the management below them as they truly are running a muck!
Pros: The only positive of this coming are the benefits such as onsite physio, but they use these benefits to cover up the fact they are terrible employers.

Dull environment
Seats are not comfortable for staff
Not fair chance to put your point in front of seniors

Your seniors level management comes every month, eat &amp; drink highest price food but no one ever bother about staff security measures to fight from unexplained disasters

Cons: It is purely people driven organisation. 
There is huge discrimination between salaries of employees of similar grade or position. Favouritism is quite prevailing. 
No standards to merit employee's performance. 
Processes of appraisal are just for sake, nobody follows it. 
Management does not take care of performers.
Advice: .
Pros: Good work-life balance is maintained. 
Nice pay packages are offered. 
Nice working atmosphere. 
Employee benefits are good. 
Employee feels no burden.

Cons: 1- Incompetent management: The management skills of middle and top management are very poor. Firstly the managers do not understand how the software industry works and then do not have the inclination of learning how it works. The people management skills of most of these managers can be gauged from the fact that a four member team has seen 8 people leave(in 2 years time) because they couldn't work in the VW IS environment.


2-Management focus: The top managers hardly play any role in the success of the IT projects. Top/middle managers or project manager hardly come into picture.
One senior manager seemed to have just one role  - point out to people that "this door can't be used for exit", "you need to wear tie" "you are only working the normal working hours??"

3-work-life balance: It is a very clear message from managers that developers need to work more that the normal working hours(No, budget doesn't permit overtime). 
Their estimates are generally very very poor and people end up working on weekends.
To give you an idea of the estimates: For one project the development lead estimated 115 man days of effort however the total development effort was 500+ man days..that too when developers had to cut corners to get the minimum functionality delivered.

I don't think there was even a proper discussion on why the estimates were so wrong.

4-software development processes:
Agile?  -NO
Waterfall?- NO
adhoc? - yes
wierd? -yes
depends on the whims and fancy of managers? - NO (remember that managers do not come into picture at all)
depends on the whims and fancy of lead? - YES and NO (yes, the development process keeps changing on the whims and fancy of the lead, however as the lead has no control - developers can divert the process at will)

Does the process work? - Good question!!


5-more focus on lip service than performance: This organisation doesn't value performance. To be really valued, one needs to be close to either the lead or the manager and if so, then he can get away with murder.

6-Highly political environment: 99% of employees in this department are contractors, including lead and project manager. First focus of these people is to cover their ^**£% and think about the task in hand later.
It is a highly political environment. Good people keep leaving as they can't survive and the crappies keep accumulating.

7- Not learning from mistakes: The worst part is that the VW IS department is not learning from its mistakes. I could see the same mistakes being repeated over and over again.
Advice: Create a meritocracy
Value competence and performance
learn from your mistakes
get rid of the existing crap managers
Managers need to play a part to see success in IT projects.
Concentrate on process
Pros: Brand name is the attractive feature

Cons: Bureaucratic, too much emphasis placed on processes, although employee car ownership scheme is an exceptional benefit you aren't always guaranteed the vehicle you want yet you must still pay the same amount. Also employees on starting salaries must pay the same as Directors for their vehicles
Advice: None
Pros: Great atmosphere, amazing benefits, opportunities to move around the brands and functions, iconic brands and talented colleagues

Cons: The Mangement has no vision at all. Promotions are more based on coffee talk than performance and knowledge. You have to be "visible" was often heard. It is part of the game but if those people take the leaed it is understandable why the company falls behind in new technologies
Advice: Change your culture and allow innovation
Pros: Work-Life-Balance

35h working week and 30d vacation are very good for someone who enjoys freedom.

Cons: Slow growth opportunities. Lack of good projects. No go ahead without approval from VW AG; this slows down the process. Lack of innovative ideas and thinking
Advice: Build your R&D in India and reduce dependence on Germany. Invest in better marketing to improve share in India
Pros: Good culture. SOP and systems in place. Good opportunity to work with cross functional teams. 
Good transport and food service

Cons: There are some pockets of management that do not follow company values and frankly, should not be there. Beware of the occasional snake.
Advice: Find dissenters and remove them to retain the best people.
Pros: I worked at VWG UK for nearly 5 years. Most people I came across were friendly, helpful and competent. Overall my experience of the company was a positive one. Good benefits.

Cons: Very poorly run, extremely unorganised, to few staff to do the job properly,shocking management as all they want to do is “hit with a stick” to get results and tick the VW boxes, bullying of some weaker staff is common place hence the revolving door, selling cars seems to be an after thought
Advice: Look after your staff properly and they will look after you and your company and make it a good place to work thus creating continuity with staff not wanting to leave all the time
Pros: The earning potential is quite good with a great quality VW brand

Cons: Volkswagen is a place where they try to create rules to make work efficient and fair for everyone, but the truth is these rules are only applied to certain people.

For example, there is a rule that 2 people with the same education and work experience should not be paid differently. 

There is another rule that sets payment levels (tariff groups) for people based on experience and education.

There is a third "rule" not written anywhere but enforced by HR when they find convenient that says people cannot be promoted more than 2 tariffs up.

Sounds all fair, but now, if you told HR that you were getting a salary of X which happens to be way lower than you would get at VW with the same experience and education. They will offer you less than they should, you accept, fair enough, not their fault you don't know better.

You get hired, you are already making less money than people with the same education and experience and thus there is a rule being broken. Then you ask for a raise to put yourself on the same levels of your colleagues, they say no because you can't be "promoted" many tariffs like that. But it is not a promotion as according to the tariff group that is exactly what you should be paid in the first place.

Would be great if would stop there. Let's say you have a friend in high places at Volkswagen and you don't have the education nor the experience to ask for a high salary. Still, you ask for a category (salary) that is meant for someone with at least 6 years more experience than you have. In general, HR would say no to this kind of request but as you came from internal and very important recommendation you get the salary that is not meant for you.

Now you are breaking 2 rules, where you make more money than people more experience and having a category not meant for you, just because of nepotism.

To make things even worse, Volkswagen pays way less to women than men.
Advice: Managemen at Volkswagen is the reason why the company is such much behind innovation. Old managers, with old mentality and old ways of doing business and managing.
