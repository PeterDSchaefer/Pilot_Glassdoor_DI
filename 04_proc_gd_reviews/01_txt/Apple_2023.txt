Cons: Work life balance can be improved, but it could also simply be working within Finance
Advice: None
Pros: Friendly, smart, hardworking people and opportunities to move teams to explore a different type of finance (Retail, Corporate, Sales, etc)

Cons: Scheduling is consistently a problem. It’s truly the only reason I have this job 4 stars. We are regularly given big promises to work with our life requirements, but policies favor young unmarried people with no kids. If you have any personal obligations other than being in college, prepare to fight for any real control over the schedule you are given. FORGET having set hours… I really do love working at Apple! However, I struggle to give my best work when I have to drastically rearrange my family life and spiritual life (which COULD be on a regular schedule) every two weeks. Apple says it has a diverse work force and all of their marketing promotes that, but their retail stores do not have that at all.
Advice: Allowing employees to have actual influence over their schedules (not the barely recognized “preferences” that employees get to submit twice a year) would mean your CUSTOMER-FACING workforce could “do their best work.” The systems in place do not reflect the values Apple embodies in other areas. 

PLEASE help us. We understand the need for automated, corporate-level implementation. 
AND.
None of us can understand why HR only uses salaried people who have minimal in-the-trenches retail experience to build the systems and make the policies. 

Ultimately, customers are missing out simply because they don’t or can’t  connect with the twenty-something, tech-enamored specialists.
Pros: It’s a fun, fast-paced environment. Specialists don’t work on commissions so we really get to enjoy talking about the products and services - because we believe in them! Wages increase each year. Benefits are generous with many choices and programs.

Cons: While Apple stands as an iconic beacon of innovation, working as a creative within its confines can present challenges. The company’s relentless pursuit of perfection often translates to high expectations and pressures, potentially leading to long hours and demanding work schedules. The collaborative environment, though fostering innovation, can sometimes mean limited individual creative autonomy due to Apple’s stringent design philosophies and brand guidelines. Being part of such a massive organization can sometimes make individual contributions feel like a drop in the ocean, potentially leading to feelings of being overshadowed. Additionally, the high visibility of Apple’s products means any design flaw or oversight is magnified in the public eye, bringing its own set of pressures. Lastly, while Apple’s reputation is a boon, it also sets a high bar, making the competition fierce among peers, which can be both motivating and daunting.
Advice: None
Pros: Working at Apple as a creative offers a unique blend of opportunities and advantages. With its longstanding legacy of innovation and design, Apple provides a platform where creativity merges seamlessly with functionality. This collaborative environment ensures that designers, engineers, and other professionals work in tandem, benefiting from cutting-edge tools and resources to bring their visions to life. Moreover, as a creative at Apple, your work has the potential to make a global impact, touching millions of lives and setting industry standards. Beyond the tangible products, Apple’s commitment to professional development ensures continual learning, allowing you to evolve and grow in your role. Furthermore, the prestige of being associated with one of the world’s most esteemed brands adds significant value to a creative’s professional journey.

Cons: -The positions that open are only available depending on if someone leaves so trying to promote may be difficult. Its all about timing.
-Everyone is always looking for a promotion so the candidate pool is very competitive
-Store Leader is almost non existent and depending on who you get you could run into someone who will fire you at will just because they don't like you. They will think of any reason and make up any story to get rid of you and wait for the perfect opportunity,
-50/50 on Managers. Some are really nice and helpful, some you question how they even got the job.
Advice: You either got to management by being where everyone else was or hired externally. Listen to your colleagues more and don't look down on them just because you're a manager. While you have the power to make their lives miserable you represent Apple's culture. You get paid significantly but still choose to be miserable and condescending. 
Pros: -Discounts for personal are 25% and discounts for friends and family are 15%
-All inclusive healthcare benefits
-Discounted Stock Purchase Program
-Holiday Pay
-Lots of PTO for full timers
-Lots of room for growth within company

Cons: Retail managers earn bonuses on goals achieved, while other team leaders and members do not have financial incentives in commission or bonuses to motivate or reward them. The constant rotation of young employees, many of whom have a poor work ethic, brings down the overall team performance and morale. Opportunities for promotion and growth are limited by fluctuating headcount. When those opportunities open up, managers often hire outside the company to get "fresh talent" and then ask those they turned down to train the new hire for the job. Multiple reports on the unprofessional behavior of managers or team members may lead to documented coaching but rarely lead to accountability that requires a change of behavior. The lack of actual or perceived consequences allows complacency and apathy. Favoritism towards the young professional for career advancement.
Advice: None
Pros: Full-time and part-time retail employees earn among the highest per-hour rates in retail. Both also have medical, dental, and vision benefits options, a matching 401(k), and stock options. Vacation days accrued based on the years served, no matter the role. Paid holidays and sick time. Short-term and long-term disability. A company that takes action on its values, including DEI, environment, and social responsibility. Multiple opportunities to continue education, including free degrees, certifications, and courses. There is also a tuition reimbursement program. The tenured team members have a strong work ethic and commitment to each other and their shared goals. A culture committed to learning, growth, and development.

Cons: It's very difficult to get promoted internally. The only real opportunity for promotion is within your current role. Internal moves to a difference team/org are all considered lateral. There isn't much you can do to influence your annual review and raise. Whether you did the bare minimum or went above and beyond, you're most likely just going to get "achieved expectations" and the standard cost of living raise. Leaders don't always reward hard work. It's difficult to change anything. It's a big company with old processes, systems, and people which enable those things. Young/new employees always want to change things for the better and then often find out that they will have to get comfortable with the way things are, unless someone higher up wants something changed. 3 days a week in office is not fun. They aren't flexible with that. It's very corporate. If you like that, great. If you're looking for a startup techy environment, this isn't it. If you aren't in a "technical" role, you get screwed on pay and stocks. They give you the bare minimum and then give the whole world to the engineers.
Advice: Be more open to change. Be more flexible to employees' personal circumstances when enforcing new policies (like hybrid work). Pay people that aren't engineers more, including stock.
Pros: It's great to be part of a company like Apple. There are smart people everywhere and you have the opportunity to get to know any of them. I've had mostly good luck with managers, and the other leaders I've met all seem to be good people. It's definitely a place where you can get comfortable and ride out your career if you want, or you can work towards more if you want to gain more experience.

Cons: - Retail senior and account managers are hourly, so you have to clock out for lunch, which means every day is technically a 9 hour day. 
- No flexible or WFH options. 
- The position is not given the full resources it deserves, which leads to unrealistic expectations and disconnect between account managers and leadership.
- The CRM software and phone system are outdated.
- The next role above requires you to move across the country, which leaves most folks stuck or stagnating because they are unable to do so.
- No bonuses.
Advice: Apple retail business teams are not given the right tools and resources to succeed, yet the expectations continue to increase. The disconnect between what leadership wants to accomplish and their lack of willingness to engage with team feedback is something that needs to change.
Pros: - Rock-solid company that took care of us during the pandemic. 
- Incredible health and mental health benefits
- Inclusive and safe atmosphere
- Opportunity to grow and learn new skills without having a lot of prior experience. Great place to get a firm foundation in a skillset like account management.

Cons: It's very taxing physically and emotionally. Customers can be extremely entitled, and you're often required to smile and endure a lot of abuse. Apple selectively enforces certain rules. Attendance is a significant issue in Apple retail, and employees often exploit the lack of enforcement. Apple's retail culture differs greatly from the corporate culture. Retail leaders are expected to maintain a cheerful demeanor and avoid disagreeing with upper management. You can't introduce disruptive ideas or alternative strategies unless they're approved by market and senior leadership. Employees can be extremely entitled, often taking matters into their own hands and not hesitating to contact Human Resources. Apple makes efforts to address various trendy social justice issues, but these efforts may not always satisfy the expectations of this new generation of employees. Apple has a 'Diversity Network Association' comprising groups like 'Black at Apple,' 'Latino at Apple,' etc. While Apple strives for diversity and inclusion, individuals who are white, male, and straight may not align with the specific demographic focus they're seeking.
Advice: Create clear development paths for managers/leaders.
Pros: Great benefits, strong ethics, and values. The environment can be fun if you enjoy constant change and busyness. The company actively seeks employee feedback on benefits, culture, and business processes. Apple also provides opportunities for employees to participate in career experiences within the corporate sector, although the selection process can be challenging and difficult to navigate.

Cons: - Some lazy/young team members that are a result of a poor job in the hiring process. These lazy individuals then complain about everything because they don't know how good that they have it. They put strain and stress on the rest of the team with countless callouts and no-shows. - Shifts on the floor can become a little mundane after a while... just as anything. You need to find ways to motivate yourself during those times. - Customer service can lead you to deal with some of the most rude individuals that you've ever encountered. - My location has a lot of international tourism so I have to use the translate app constantly, which can take the fun out of getting to know people through genuine human conversations.
Advice: I've never had any issues with management. They've been clear and concise from my perspective.
Pros: - Amazing benefits even for part-time employees (health insurance, employee stock purchase plan, 401k, family planning and growth, tuition reimbursement program, financial literacy &amp; planning, legal assistance, incredible cell phone plans, amazing discounts on products &amp; services, and so much more) - Inclusive work environment - Fair wage for what this role requires because the products sell themselves - Plenty of room for growth and stability within other areas of the company

Cons: In the past, it has felt like the company was very heavily focused on the "people" aspect. For at least a year, the focus has heavily shifted towards numbers, sales goals, and everything you would expect from Apple's competitors. It is very discouraging to have management almost breathing down your back when you are not hitting certain numbers.
Advice: Always make it about the people. Be leaders, not managers. When your specialists see leaders and managers on the floor not only helping their team, but helping employees, it truly puts this positive shine on them. It makes employees feel seen as what they are doing is truly important work. 
Pros: The relationships you build at Apple are incredible. You meet some of the most incredible people. You are put into this position where you can not only help build relationships with your peers, but build them with customers. I loved going into the building every day getting to learn something new about everyone who walked through those same doors.

Cons: 1. High pressure workplace
2. Very stingy. Bullies suppliers.
3. Short-termist - quarterly results over everything else.
4. Bad data and systems - Tons of low-quality admin work which is better outsourced to Philippines or India.
5. Insane number of meetings day and night. WLB is a nightmare. Breakups and divorces galore!
6. Apple believes "Once a GSM, always a GSM".
Advice: Work actively to cut down BS admin work and keynotes upon keynotes for reviewing mundane information.
Pros: 1. Good teammates.
2. Pay : Not a tech job but you can still make 30% to 50% of an Apple SWE. Some GSMs can make a lot more if you work hard and long.
3. Apple brand : So other bay area recruiters with the attention span of a goldfish dont have to worry too much about understanding your previous non-tech work history.
4. Hardware design excellence - You dont do much as a GSM but you atleast get to work with best engineers and product guys.

Cons: Lack of opportunities, getting a rotation or CE(internship) is largely luck based, how well you perform in your role doesn’t matter for the aforementioned. Applecare is just another call center with apple branding, now all they care about is the metrics and whether or not you’re meeting them. Pay is comically low for getting into a senior role and being expected to handle ALL ios and Mac related calls.
Advice: Pay your Applecare employees more, it is very obviously one of the most stressful roles in the entirety of Apple. When people apply for internal roles, don’t make them go through 2-3 interviews, train your interviewers to get it done in one go. When I joined I was told to be my “authentic self”, that quickly faded away and turned into “be your authentic self (as long as you meet metrics).
Pros: Decent benefits, great coworkers, a lot of great managers, discounts for apple products, stocks, great 401k.

Cons: High Call Volume, but Not a Deal-Breaker: The constant influx of calls, while a testament to Apple's popularity, wasn't even a significant drawback. It's the only con I could think of, and overall, the job was fantastic.
Advice: Leverage the existing transparency culture: Continue to communicate openly with employees about company strategies, changes, and developments. This transparency fosters a sense of trust and belonging, contributing to a positive work environment. Additionally, explore ways to recognize and reward exceptional performance, reinforcing the appreciation for the hard work put in by the dedicated customer service team.
Pros: Meaningful Impact: Helping customers from basic troubleshooting to fraud issues provided a sense of purpose. Career Growth: Swiftly rising to SME status in just over a year showcased ample opportunities for advancement. Flexibility: Enjoyed the freedom to choose between day and night shifts, promoting work-life balance. Holidays Off: Appreciated the rare perk of having holidays off, contributing to a better work-life harmony. Inclusive Environment: Apple's commitment to diversity and inclusion made the workplace welcoming and respectful.

Cons: -Work could sometimes be stressful, especially during the holidays, or during some other catastrophic event (ie. “The battery replacement program” and when systems would occasionally go down (ie. pos system, appointment / note taking systems)
-Dealing with irate customers (normal working in the Genius Bar)
-Because the Admin team was so small, call-outs could make or break the flow of the day causing chaos.
-Can be difficult to climb the proverbial ladder due to the intense competition of all of the brilliant team members applying for the same job.
Advice: Be more receptive to Critical Feedback as much as you give critical feedback. Give positive specific feedback on desirable behaviors as close to in the moment as possible. Your people will respect you more.
Pros: -Fun work environment
-I loved my job as a Genius Admin
-Almost full autonomy in my role, leaders trusted my decisions
-Nice blend of operations and customer-facing experience
-Had a small team of other Admins in which we all leaned on for support

Cons: Management can be better handpicked. They seem as they never know what they are really doing. Certain they have good intentions, but that does not always get you very far. Consider the fact that this is a big company, so there will always be changes and it is best for those who can adapt well. Just needs more in store structure, and better judgement when it comes to retail employee satisfaction.
Advice: Senior Managers, focus on developing a leadership team with structure instead of being the bad guy with rules that are interchangeable . Store leaders, be the bad and good guy. Consistent recognition should be a genuine and personal experience from you, however be professional. You gain respect and loyalty with an increase in performance from employees. Management and Leads work alongside to promote diversity and core values to develop a team of people who are excited to report to work everyday and model these behaviors to internal and external customers.
Pros: You are given the opportunity to meet amazing people and develop values and lifelong skills. With these opportunities determine if you will succeed or not. You receive what you put out. As long as there is a positive atmosphere and you try not to lose yourself in the stimulation of making work your entire life, you will be fine. Apple is filled with very passionate people, enjoy them and take advantage of the experiences and benefits that the company has to offer.

Cons: The downsides to this job is the downtime between calls. We only had a few minutes of break, say after a call with a customer who was angry about something and calling you names. You didn't have the time to regroup before having to jump into the next call. We were "encouraged" to solve the issue quickly so we could move on to the next customer in the queue.
Advice: None
Pros: I enjoyed this job because it was remote, I was fully engaged with my peers, my leader was just enough present to offer immediate advice on issues outside of the tier 1 support scope. But we were encouraged to find the answers ourselves, to help each other, and in doing so, we were learning the iOS inside and out faster than you'd think.

Cons: Management was awful. Played favorites. I was a seasonal specialist, and everyone in my core was hired as full-on specialist except for me. Even several cores after me had been hired on. I had hand-fulls of customers wanting to speak with my managers about my excellent customer service daily. I went above and beyond for my customers (I did truly enjoy helping people.) I had high percentages on my AppleCare sales. And I never got hired on as a permanent specialist. This job is a joke. They make you obsessed with Apple and their products. It's a cult forsure. Look up their credo, super weird. If you like kissing butts and putting on a fake smile everyday, this job is for you.
Advice: Stop pretending to "love" your job. You love getting paid 100k a year. 
Pros: $20 an hour was the only reason I stayed at this job

Cons: High Expectations and Pressure: Apple is known for its high standards and intense work culture. The pressure to meet deadlines and deliver exceptional results can be stressful and demanding, potentially leading to work-life imbalance. Long Hours and Overtime: Employees may find themselves working long hours and sometimes being required to work overtime, especially during product launches or critical project phases.
Advice: jghfgxdcbvnbjlkhkgcfv
Pros: Innovative Environment: Apple is known for its innovation and cutting-edge technology. Working in such an environment can provide an opportunity to be at the forefront of technological advancements and contribute to groundbreaking projects. Learning and Growth: Apple offers a culture of continuous learning and development. Employees often have access to extensive resources, training programs, and opportunities for skill enhancement, which can accelerate professional growth. Global Impact: Apple products are used worldwide, and working for a company with a significant global presence can give you a sense of contributing to a larger, international audience and making a global impact through technology. Employee Benefits: Apple is known to offer competitive employee benefits, including health insurance, retirement plans, stock options, employee discounts on Apple products, and other perks that contribute to a good work-life balance.

Cons: - Paid below market average for a senior account management role. 
- The official job title "Business Pro" may de-value job experience due to naming ambiguity and put you at a competitive disadvantage on the job market when viewed by hiring managers. 
- Fully on-sight for a role that shouldn't require it. No hybrid flexibility. 
- Holidays off can become a battle with management.
- Lumped together with front-of-house retail employees. Needs of retail employees and inside sales account managers do not always align. Management constantly have to try to balance pleasing everyone.
- No clear career growth unless you want to work as a "corporate" Account Manager in Elk grove.
Advice: None
Pros: - Job security 
- Culture 
- Benefits
- Stock Plan
- Career experience programs to grow within different areas of the company for 5 months.

Cons: High Workload: Apple is known for its fast-paced work environment, which can result in heavy workloads and long hours at times, leading to increased stress and work-life imbalance. Intense Competition: Apple operates in a highly competitive industry, which means employees may face intense pressure to meet deadlines and deliver exceptional results consistently. Secrecy and Confidentiality: Apple places a strong emphasis on secrecy and confidentiality, which can limit the sharing of information and collaboration outside of the company, potentially restricting creativity and innovation. Limited Work-Life Balance: Due to the demanding nature of the work and high expectations, maintaining a healthy work-life balance at Apple can be challenging. Perfectionist Culture: Apple has a reputation for its meticulous attention to detail and pursuit of perfection, which can create a high-pressure environment where mistakes may be less tolerated.
Advice: None
Pros: Innovative Work Environment: Apple fosters a culture of innovation, which allows employees to work on cutting-edge technologies and projects that push the boundaries of technology. Competitive Compensation: Apple offers competitive salaries and benefits packages to its employees, ensuring that they are rewarded for their contributions and hard work. Brand Prestige: Being associated with Apple carries a certain prestige in the industry and can enhance your professional reputation. Career Development Opportunities: Apple provides numerous opportunities for career growth and development through training programs, mentorship, and internal mobility. Employee Discounts: Apple employees enjoy discounts on Apple products, which can be a significant perk for tech enthusiasts and consumers.

Cons: Very difficult to move within the company after acquiring new skills and/or credentials. Retaliatory culture when speaking out in good faith. In my role, often times my mental health is disregarded for the numbers game the manager wants to represent. For example, they will remove breaks, and meetings, and keep calls back to back within seconds of ending a call. I feel like with that management, I am thought as a number. Possibly a robot to just spit out additional numbers. We are supposed to rely on other teams for support and rude team members get no accountability for their lack of support and toxic behavior. I have actually seen my own workplace bully, who I out performed get promoted and recruit more bullies and nothing has been done. I was actually retaliated against and denied promotions.
Advice: When selecting hiring managers for interviews, include an HR representative or hiring personnel that has experience with onboarding and interviewing individuals of diverse backgrounds during the actual interview. These new managers are given autonomy to make or break career opportunities when they have no workforce skills. They get a training and the go destroy an employees career goals because they do not know how to interview. Listen to your employees and make it right when they have been wronged by toxic, coworkers, management, and leadership.
Pros: Hard work reflects in metrics, which is rewarded. Benefits and pay for this role is extremely competitive and makes the job worthwhile.

Cons: While retail may require little to no experience, getting into corporate is much harder. Career development is also limited in retail, and the company priorities external hires for leadership roles. Movement from retail to corporate is almost impossible. As a result, there are very few tenured employees in retail. Retail pay, while better than the rest of the industry is still lacking. Apple store are located in affluent cities or suburbs and retail pay does not keep up to the cost of living. Retail managers, market leaders and directors are the only retail employees making more than their locations cost of living. Corporate employees also fare better when it comes to pay.
Advice: Develop internal talent and stop hiring externally. Pay better.
Pros: No experience needed to work in retail. 
Great benefits. 
Retail pay is better than industry retail pay (however see cons for details on pay)

Cons: Management, next to no work life balance and managements excuse is “it’s retail”. The company gives loads of great benefits but can never enjoy them since you get paid Pennie’s on the dollar. Were made to recite a credo that is only intended for retail to follow and it only applies to those who are not in a leadership position. We’re told to give more than we take but have no homes to live in or money to buy groceries.
Advice: Please practice empathy especially to those employees who sleep in their cars or have have no homes to go to. I work at a store where I could name 4 employees who don’t have a home.
Pros: Good work environment with great people to work around. Apple hires literally the best people to work around. My greatest friendships came from here and I’m thankful for that.

Cons: Very hectic work life. My group has a requirement that nobody can take more time off than 2 weeks at a stretch. But now with remote work arrangements you can work from remote geographies for up to 4 weeks a year and can combine it with vacations. This policy is generally working out well enough so far. The ESPP policy limits you to no more than 10% of your salary to be invested. No matching rewards on ESPP. But the stock appreciation and stability of the stock price probably make up for it.
Advice: Trust in employees is a two-way street. It is reasonable to expect employees to respect company secrets. But in turn the company should respect employees’ need for long leaves, sabbaticals, and other means to refresh themselves and come back to work with great vigor and newer perspectives. It may also be a good idea to consider offering a learning sabbatical every 7 years to allow folks to take a 3 month leave to learn new skills and come back to apply them to work. The company benefits, and the employees get the time to dedicate time to learning.
Pros: Very good pay and benefits. Management genuinely appreciates good work done. They provide good compensation raises and bonuses to keep you. Leave credits to you fairly. And the stock appreciation does give you some good upside. The employee purchase plan (EPP) is good. Plus they have EPP+ which gives extra money for purchases every three years. The company buys and uses some of the best software packages from vendors and so you are enabled to do a very high quality work using the best software there is.

Cons: High pressure and demanding work environment, with tight deadlines and high expectations Steep learning curve for new employees due to complex processes and systems Can be challenging to balance work and personal life due to the demands of the job Highly competitive and fast-paced industry, with rapid changes in technology and consumer trends that can be difficult to keep up with Limited opportunities for creativity and experimentation due to the company's focus on maintaining a consistent brand image and product design
Advice: One thing I've learned over the years is the importance of taking risks and stepping outside of your comfort zone. It can be scary to try new things and take on new challenges, but it's often the only way to truly grow and learn as a person. My advice to anyone who's feeling stuck or stagnant in their career or personal life is to start small and work your way up. Maybe try taking on a new project at work, or signing up for a class or workshop in a subject that interests you. Or maybe it's just as simple as reaching out to someone new and striking up a conversation. Whatever it is, don't be afraid to push yourself and take that first step. You never know where it might lead you.
Pros: Opportunity to work with a renowned brand known for innovation and quality Chance to work with talented individuals from diverse backgrounds Emphasis on employee growth and development Competitive salary and benefits package, including bonuses and stock options Focus on work-life balance and employee wellness, fostering a positive work culture

Cons: Rough customer service job. Apple is extremely competitive even for internal job searches and it is nearly impossible to move up to be an engineer (I studied mechanical engineering).
Advice: The majority of college students working this job are doing it because they want to work at Apple after graduation. So it would be best to make finding them a job within Apple a priority (a job not in customer service).
Pros: Good pay for a college student, benefits you would not see at other part-time jobs, and the Apple brand name in your resume is always good.

Cons: The role can often be misunderstood by management, and other store functions due to being in a retail environment.

- By the end of the day, you are a retail employee. If the needs of the business within the store require help, the business team may be subject to pause their operation and assist in-store customers
- If you are in a low-volume store, you may be the only person working as a Business Pro on your team
- This position is not often offered to external candidates.
- The role can be performed autonomously, in a corporate setting, or even in a hybrid capacity but your work output is defined based on hours worked in the store. This means that slower velocity on the business team and a perceived lack of action (being on a phone or talking to a peer) could lead to disciplinary conversations depending on the management
- Leadership rotates to own different parts of the store for a few quarters. If a manager is assigned to a business team, the management style or knowledge of how to support them could change positively or negatively. This risk in management style could lead to inconsistent experiences for both employee and customer
- There is no incentive for good performance. You may contribute well to account growth, revenue, and retention but you will not be rewarded outside of your annual pay review which is also subject to the performance of the store (outside of your control)
- Perception is dangerous for a misunderstood team in a retail setting. This position requires you to be in front of a computer for the majority of your day and if you do not find something to do during a slowdown that shows some output of work like updating AppleCRM (apart from supporting the sales floor), you could be perceived as not working.
- Outside of Slack, you do not get to use industry-leading tools such as Salesforce. Apple likes to provide many in-house software or antiquated software (Webex).
- There is no developmental path related to the business team apart from the Account Manager position which requires relocation.
- Management often does not know how to develop people from the business team into other roles besides in-store positions which tend to pay less or a shift in career paths.
- Most importantly, the business team's success (client retention and revenue) ultimately depends on a good economy where businesses are buying. Your job security could be at risk if companies are negatively impacted by the economy and are not buying. This could also apply to all functions in the store.
Advice: If you are a manager rotating to support your store's business team. Please listen to your predecessor (manager rotating out) and spend some time learning about the team members before implementing drastic changes.
If you are a store leader, consider extending the rotation to allow management to get a full picture of the team, its customers, and the business trends. Work with your BDM, not against them, and find a balance of compromise for your team. 
If you manage the greater scheme of Apple Business, consider finding incentives that retain customers since loyalty pricing no longer exists. Reward your customers for loyalty rather than punish them with bad news during a downward economy. 
Pros: This alongside the Business Expert position are nice gateway roles to transition from retail sales into an account management, post-sales, and customer success career. 

- No sales quotas, just basic performance indexes (quarterly engagement, business team-specific goals typically YoY and quarter
- Depending on management, an easy means to develop soft skills such as over-the-phone communication, email etiquette, data analytics (interpreting results)
- Pay tends to be higher than some other areas of the store aside from management and leads
- There isn't often a push to cold call companies unless you're tasked to engage with churned customers
- If you are working from a high-performing store, you will have the luxury of a decent-sized team
- This role enables cross-collaborations with functions beyond the Apple Store (e.g., online sales, retail contact center, AppleCare, ABM, etc.) as well as third-party providers (Jamf, Fusion of Ideas, Phobia)
- Strong networking opportunity with business customers if solid rapport is built
- Depending on the store, scheduling tends to be more consistent than other roles

Cons: Demanding workload and long hours: Apple is known for its fast-paced environment and high expectations. Be prepared for long hours, tight deadlines, and a pressure-cooker atmosphere.
Work-life balance: Due to the demanding nature of the work, achieving a healthy work-life balance can be challenging. It's essential to set boundaries and prioritize personal well-being to avoid burnout.
Competitive internal culture: While collaboration is encouraged, there can also be a strong sense of competition within teams and departments. This can be motivating but also lead to internal politics and pressure to outperform colleagues.
Limited upward mobility: Apple has a flat hierarchy, making it more challenging to climb the corporate ladder compared to some other tech companies. Promotions can be infrequent, and advancement may require lateral moves to different teams.
Bureaucracy and rigidity: Apple's large size and emphasis on secrecy can lead to bureaucratic processes and slow decision-making. This can be frustrating for those who prefer a more agile and flexible work environment.
Advice: Focus on communication and leadership skills: Develop your ability to effectively communicate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences. Additionally, hone your leadership skills to motivate and guide your team towards achieving shared goals.
Build strong relationships: Networking and establishing connections within the company are crucial for career advancement. Actively participate in cross-functional initiatives and build rapport with colleagues in different departments.
Prioritize your well-being: Set clear boundaries and ensure you have sufficient time for rest and personal pursuits. Don't hesitate to utilize the company's resources for mental and physical health support.
Be adaptable and proactive: Be prepared to learn new skills and adapt to changing priorities. Proactively seek opportunities to take on new challenges and demonstrate your potential for growth.
Manage expectations and set goals: Understand the long-term career path at Apple and set realistic goals for your advancement. This will help you navigate the internal landscape and manage your expectations for professional growth.
Pros: Cutting-edge projects: Apple is at the forefront of AI and ML, working on ambitious projects that push the boundaries of the field. Being involved in these projects can be incredibly rewarding and lead to groundbreaking contributions.
Talented colleagues: You'll be surrounded by some of the brightest minds in tech, offering opportunities for collaboration and learning from the best. This can significantly accelerate your own growth and expertise.
Excellent perks and benefits: Apple is known for its generous benefits package, including competitive salaries, comprehensive healthcare, generous stock options, and discounts on Apple products.
Brand reputation and career growth: Working at a brand like Apple carries significant weight on your resume and opens doors to future career opportunities. The experience and skills gained can be invaluable for further advancement.
Positive work environment: Apple generally fosters a collaborative and supportive culture, with a focus on innovation and creativity. This can make work feel more engaging and fulfilling.

Cons: Promotions can get tough, I hated that I had to constantly interview for new positions, when I was out preforming some of the other people I was interviewing against. I would get passed up for a promotion, simply because I didn't interview as well. This makes it hard for people who tend to be more nervous. Also the scheduling, it's a retail job, so what do you expect. Just plan your vacations in advance and make sure they get approved.
Advice: Passing on people for promotions simply because they didn't interview as strongly as their competitors can be really hard. I would suggest provide more coaching for those who struggle with interviewing in order to set them up for success!
Pros: Very diverse work place, probably one of the best of any retail place i've ever worked. Pay is fair and raises happen annually and could go up by almost a dollar a year, if you're preforming very well in your job. I enjoyed my time there and I really saw several various opportunities even at the retail level. Also, providing benefits for part time employees was a huge plus. Not many retail places do that.

Cons: If you work from home, your pay will lower if you move to a less than superb market area for the company. You do sign an agreement for this, but it is an evil ultimatum to agree to take a pay cut if you move. From experience moving somewhere more expensive does not mean your pay won’t suffer.
Advice: I think corporate management is, for the most part, fantastic!
Pros: Insurance available upon employment (at least when I started)
Amazing co workers 
Great management
Multiple corporate benefits like on site doctor, fitness center, dentist, massage therapist, etc
Yearly raises
Decent medical insurance 
Decent time off

Cons: If you have greater aspirations and dreams, it gets easy to lose sight of them since the job is very good. I know many people who end up working there for 3, 5, and even 10 years, who had dreams of being an actor or lawyer but just got comfortable in the pay and benefits and couldn't just leave. It's like you get just enough to live so you have to keep working, but it's not enough to justify risking for something that might not even happen. Don't get me wrong, it's a great job, a lot of people stay because they are content and like it. And if you want to work at Apple and climb up the ranks it is possible and encouraged. However, if you think that you'll work here for a couple months as a pit stop on the road to your goal, be careful because it can suck you in. Every person and situation is different, but I've seen this same thing far too much, and I almost fell victim to it myself.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay, benefits, and work environment.

Cons: There is no time for life at at Apple, only work. If you enjoy what you do, and don't have obligations or passion outside of your work, this is the place for you. I do like what I do, but I have always thought that a person should work to live, not live to work.
Advice: Most people are happier and do better work when they have the time to enjoy life outside of and between work days. Most people are not cut out for Apple, so they are filtered out and do not stick around or even apply in the first place. However, even the driven, hardworking, intelligent, and committed people I work with would all flourish more with a better work-life balance. Yes, that would mean a higher cost for Apple, so I know it wont happen.
Pros: Other than the complete lack of a life in the balance, working for Apple is great. The pay, bonuses, benefits, and perks are awesome. The opportunities for career growth and personal growth are near infinite. You will be pushed to and beyond your limits regularly, you will grow as a person and in your skills, and you will do some very cool things at Apple-you just will also not have have the time to sleep, eat, do your laundry, take care of your cat/dog, see your family, or have a social life out side of the weekends.

Cons: Depending on your store, it can be heaven or hell. There’s a lot of toxic positivity and pettiness from management and leadership. Corporate doesn’t really care about the people. 
Advice: I had managers tell me that I catered too much to black people during my sessions I taught. I had managers tell me that positive intent isn’t needed for good feedback. I think you need to really just take time to align with what you actually preach company wide and store wide and not just make it up as you go
Pros: Great benefits, room to grow, Good community, culture at work is nice.

Cons: Terrible organizational culture, terrible leadership in my sub-org. Not a "people" oriented organization, as an understatement. This is especially true for managers, and perhaps less so for hands on engineers. It's not only the work-life balance, which is not anywhere close to balanced, but also a disrespectful attitude towards employees, their work environment and personal lives, micromanagement, and super wild freestyle "planning", if you can call it planning, with project assignments or plans that are frequently reshuffled or extremely changed in no advance notice, and without stable visible med to long term planning (short term planning is very shaky as well). Tons of meetings is a norm, oversubscription too. Zero time to innovate, unless you're ready to do it on your weekend or at night. Unless the compensation is an extreme game changer for you, that justifies selling your soul to the organization, stay away. Again, that applies only to managerial roles and only to the department that I work for, don't know if that's the case for other roles and organizations in Apple as well. Judging from other reviews, it doesn't seem that different in other Apple organizations sadly.
Advice: Learn how to manage
Pros: Total compensation package, which is highly stock weighted, is very nice.

Cons: Management doesn’t know what they’re doing Micromanaging Passive aggressiveness from management when you try to take time off If you try to take time off bc you’re unwell you get lectured even if you have sick time. Claims to be family culture but they have no empathy no compassion for its employees. In your contract you’re told you are not numbers based but all they talk about is selling extra stuff to customers and pushing services down their throats just like the carriers. And if they say no to buying a service we get in trouble
Advice: Practice what you preach. Learn to have empathy for your employees and if you say to assume positive intent with managements decisions do the same for your employees. Nobody feels comfortable talking to managers
Pros: Great benefits Stock options Pay Health care

Cons: It should be easier to transition to corporate if you want you should have the better chance to get a job in corporate if they are vacant. Many people come to Apple retail with hopes of going to corporate the sad truth is it is possible but also unlikely unless you spend at least 10+ year with the company
Advice: Growth is important !
Pros: Set schedule Monday -Friday (Apple business team)

Apple is the greatest American company maybe the greatest company period .

They take care of the employees ; they make sure you are heared. It’s tough to move up in the beginning but once you find your Rythm and direction it’s all about exhibiting a drive for results !

Cons: Micromanagement is at an all time high. No work life balance. If you are a parent, especially a single parent, forget it. They don’t care if your kids sick.. they don’t care if you need time off. Taking a leave of absence is an obstacle course to get. Working at Apple Retail should qualify you for being on a reality TV show because of the amount of drama you’ll encounter. It’s literally like being in highschool. The union busting tactics are shameful. You’ll be put in a position to not do things in the customers best interest and instead the companies best interest. It’s no longer about repairing relationships, it’s about hitting metrics so managers can get their giant bonuses at the end of the year.. all of which you won’t see a penny of. Your annual review will tell you consistently that you performed “at expectations”, you’ll never get “exceeded expectations” even if you were one of the highest performers. You won’t get promoted, especially in the Orlando market. They’d rather hire an external to take that role you’ve worked so hard to get. If you don’t answer your interview questions the way they want you to (in story format hitting “compentencies”) you’ll be passed over.
Advice: None
Pros: Your coworkers become family. Pizza parties during launch (lol)

Cons: The leadership can be really inconsistent with its clarity on how they want things done. Also, the Ben when things are planned out, there are a lot of people that are just bribed out here and don’t really take the time to avoid simple mistakes.
Advice: Please follow through on action plans. Teams don’t like it when you talk the talk but don’t walk the walk.
Pros: Great pay and benefits, cool opportunities to try “experiences” for 6 months and learn new skills, great balance for part time cause you can’t really be bothered outside of work. The product discounts are nice and the pay is better than most food and retail pay in the city. You can really stay in your own lane at retail if you want to really unplug.

Cons: Poor leadership, a cult like mentality cloaked in warm fuzzy feelings of being "family". Fake woke Feedback is not what it was 10 years ago, no concern for safety of employees and customers. Employee Relations is so slow to do anything. If you've been there more than 5 years you start to over stay your welcome, if you're over 10 years you start to turn into a husk of a human. Career experiences and growth opportunities have significantly decreased. When you do get an experience there is little to no chance of a job offer. You're used to do the work and tossed back to where you came from - low cost labor. Union busting ADA Accommodations are slow to be approved You're treated differently if you take any type of medical leave. It's sad to see what they say about others on leave and then when your time comes you know what they are likely saying about you. My close friend and coworker died by suicide. I always wonder if the last straw was a scheduling issue to take her disabled husband to a surgery. God writing this makes me wonder why I'm still here.
Advice: Better training.
Pros: The benefits are good, health insurance costs have gone up every year. EAP is nice to have when they've pushed you to a mental break down. Pay is great if you're a while male.

Cons: Pay sucks, management sucks, they function almost entirely out of negative reinforcement means, they have a culture where if you're not part of the "in crowd", you're miserable and eventually forced out. I did not believe a company could discriminate THAT BLATANTLY in todays world AND get away with it, with zero consequences and no ability for you to defend yourself.
Advice: People actually have feelings and lives outside of Apple. I understand "we are the face of the company", but we are also human beings with a life to live without worrying that we'll be waiting for a subway train and something we say to a friend or passerby will end up getting us fired. Something like, "I work for Apple", cause... Yea... Not supposed to let people know you work for the company.
Pros: You make friends, cause EVERYONE wants your discount.

Cons: Like with any other corporate retail place, you have to deal with adults who are disingenuous about everything because they have to listen to what corporate says. They don't really care about you, they care about their own agendas and pockets. You might get lucky and ride a wave to move forward, but that's if you're the "right person" for what they need in the moment, NOT what is the best overall. Lying store leaders. Kiss butt managers and leads who only care about, or are pressured to care about moving their careers forward. Get certified, become a genius, leave for a real job with fair pay and a real work life balance.
Advice: Stop micro managing? Honestly, it doesn't matter.... Money is the bottom line. Investors will always matter more than disposable retail employees. Advice for upper management will always fall on deaf ears.
Pros: Good benefits such as health care, matching 401K, stock options.

Cons: Inconsistent schedule
Gender bias
Exploitative employee success metrics
Advice: When your employees tell you that there are major issues within the team be proactive and thorough when addressing them. Market Team 7 (specifically RP) tends to bandaid issues and shame the team members bringing the issues to your attention. The market regularly protects male predators- and I do mean predators, by transferring them to another store in the city. They have transferred managers who are openly racist/homophobic (use slurs) and who have openly groped female employees. The women in the business are responsible for the burden of continuing to work with these people and not offered accommodations. There have been mass resignations of tenured employees which is usually an indicator of something being amiss. Employee morale is not the issue- that transfers the root of the issue onto employee’s bad attitudes, it is leadership’s poor time management skills and communication skills amongst the leadership teams. The company itself is wonderful- the medical benefits are awesome, dental is phenomenal and vision is just okay. Pay is decent and better than other retail jobs. But the success of the employees and stores largely relies on the leadership team and there are major glaring issues within the Market that have been pointed out for the last three years- twice a year in the internal employee surveys abut have never been resolved.
Pros: Decent Pay
Co-workers are amazing
Benefits are very generous

Cons: Didn't realize I wrote all of the pros/cons under Pro's*
Advice: Listen to your team and stop cutting peoples throat to help you look better. I've seen them from a NUMBER-- and I mean a NUMBER of Team Managers. (TM's).
Pros: I worked for AppleCare for 5 years. I cant' speak to the onboarding process or interview questions as that has significantly changed over the years. What I will say is that Apple does invest a lot into making you be successful and it's rare that I see people leave unless they are completely getting out of the industry or decide to go back to school full-time. The benefits are great (both medical, etc + the EPP discount (product discount). Management does seem like they are trying to be the next best thing (Area manager, business manager, etc), and will turn metrics into making it seem like you are underachieving as opposed to the rest of the team/org. You get something right (avg. handle time, after call work, etc) and then some other KPI starts to fall. They are quick to stick you on an action plan to correct "such behaviors". I was not fired but left because of so many changes to management and I really felt like there was a loss of the customer appeasement Apple use to hold so dearly too. I'd recommend the job/career but don't expect it to be your end all be all.

Cons: Your experience here will vary, to an incredible degree, from team to team. The company often demands a lot from each team. Some teams are stretched so thin that you will find that doing your job requires navigating their bottlenecks. If you're not the type of person that enjoys nitty gritty "perfectionist" type of work, you will not have a good time. Apple is intent on making sure even the smallest issues goes unnoticed. There are occasionally extremely smart but extremely rude/combative people, and to succeed you either have to be one of them or tiptoe around them.
Advice: None
Pros: Your experience will vary a lot depending on the team, but so far I've had the pleasure of working with incredibly talented people. Many of the people seems to be highly motivated and driven and isn't in the company just to collect the paycheck. If you're the kind of person that enjoys meticulousness and perfection, the company rewards that kind of attention to detail. There's relatively little large scale drama going on. Your soft skills will be tested and you will learn a lot.

Cons: Could never get time off without putting up a fight for it. Not enough employees to handle the amount of foot traffic in the store. Customers are constantly angry due to their appointment times not being honored. Mentally exhausting. Currently a big chunk of our team are on leave. Management doesn't even know how the store runs. They ask the team how to do things all the time. Very culty vibe.
Advice: Stop putting a little bandaid on all of the problems we have in the store. Come up with real solutions and listen to the people who do the work in the store. Stop hanging out in the back chatting it up and maybe actually help your team out.
Pros: Good benefits and awesome non-leadership coworkers

Cons: At the end of the day, Apple is a massive company and very competitive. Leadership for the most part is great but you’re also one out of thousands and your feedback is not going to get as much attention and won’t have as much weight as when you’re in a small company.
Advice: More growth and development opportunities especially for outside of the US. Also some language courses for any country with an HQ would be phenomenal.
Pros: First time working somewhere where it feels like Apple wants to push me forward. I don’t feel held back at all. If you want it and are willing to work for it, you’ll get there and with great pay too!

Cons: Things have changed so much in my 5+ years working at Apple. The focus has moved from its employees to how can we be more profitable (which isn't surprising given its Market share). The problem with this is that Apple culture CANNOT live and grow when that is now your new goal. - You do well you get no recognition of it and have to take on more work with no pay raise - Little to no accountability for team members who are slacking. Instead we see them get promoted for no reason -Leadership really makes or breaks the culture. Overall Apple's culture is incredible but add one bad leader into the mix it all comes down. - A lot of attrition in entry-level roles -Pay does not keep up with market rates but they are at least trying to
Advice: - Stop with the favoritism - Go back to being human with the team and not look at people as numbers and dollar signs.
Pros: - Some of the best people I've ever met. Everyone is so helpful, smart, and resourceful. - Benefits are UNMATCHED - Training and Development opportunities are everywhere - I've learned and developed so much since I started - Be a part of such an incredible company

Cons: Dealing with ambiguity is used as a crutch for poor planning and leadership throwing spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks.
Advice: Development of talent is lacking. The Austin campus has become a factory of great talent for competitors. The people are the soul of Apple. That soul is becoming pale and hollow due to the many glass ceilings.
Pros: The culture and people working are fantastic. Best support and openness I have ever experienced. Most protocols make sense. Even under performers become productive because of the nurturing mind share. There is freedom to express thoughts, recover from blunders, and explore good ideas with competent team mates.

Cons: While Apple is widely regarded as a prestigious and innovative company to work for, like any workplace, it may have its downsides. From my experience, here are some potential challenges of working at Apple:

1. **High Expectations:**
 - Apple sets exceptionally high standards for its employees. The expectation for excellence can be stressful and may lead to a demanding work environment.

2. **Intense Workload:**
 - Due to the fast-paced nature of the tech industry and Apple's commitment to innovation, employees might face a heavy workload and tight deadlines.

3. **Secrecy and Confidentiality:**
 - Apple is known for its secrecy regarding product development. While this contributes to the element of surprise, it may limit the information employees have about the company's overall direction.

4. **Limited Autonomy:**
 - The focus on a unified design and product strategy may limit individual autonomy, especially in decision-making processes where conformity to Apple's design principles is crucial.

5. **Non-Negotiable Design Standards:**
 - While Apple's design standards contribute to its success, some employees might find it limiting to adhere strictly to these standards, especially if they have divergent creative ideas.

6. **Competitive Work Environment:**
 - The high caliber of Apple employees means that the workplace can be highly competitive. This might create pressure to continuously perform at a top level.

7. **Limited Flexibility:**
 - The company's commitment to its brand image and product consistency may limit flexibility in terms of adapting to individual work styles or adopting new technologies.

8. **Career Advancement Challenges:**
 - Given the talent pool and the flat organizational structure, career advancement might be competitive, and opportunities for promotions could be limited.

9. **Work-Life Balance:**
 - The fast-paced environment and high expectations may impact work-life balance for some employees, potentially leading to long working hours.

10. **Product Launch Stress:**
 - Employees involved in product development may face significant stress, especially around product launch periods, due to the critical reception and scrutiny that Apple products often receive.

It's essential to note that the work experience can vary widely depending on the specific role, team, and individual preferences. What might be a challenge for one person could be a positive aspect for another, depending on personal career goals and working style. It's always advisable to research and consider your priorities and preferences before deciding if a workplace like Apple aligns with your professional objectives.
Advice: I have observed instances where communication challenges and operational inefficiencies could be addressed to improve daily workflow as well as quality of life. There is an opportunity of improvement around enhancing communication channels and streamlining daily tasks. Many times poor communication or a lack of communication caused avoidable issues. Many of these issues fell on the lowest employee in the chain of events.

It would be beneficial for management to consider more proactive measures to address issues before they escalate to the point of involving HR. This might involve more regular check-ins, open forums for feedback, or specialized management tools to facilitate better communication and task management.
Pros: I had the distinct privilege of being part of the Apple Inc. team for a considerable period, and I wanted to share my reflections on this extraordinary journey from an employee's perspective.

**Innovative Culture:**
Apple's commitment to innovation is not just a slogan but a daily reality. The work environment is permeated with a spirit of creativity that encourages employees to think differently and push the boundaries of what's possible. The emphasis on groundbreaking products and solutions is palpable, creating an atmosphere that inspires excellence.

**Passionate and Talented Teams:**
One of the standout features of Apple is the caliber of its workforce. Working alongside passionate and talented individuals was not only motivating but also created a collaborative atmosphere that fostered the exchange of ideas. The diversity of thought and expertise within teams is a testament to Apple's commitment to assembling the best talent.

**Commitment to Excellence:**
Excellence is not an option; it's the expectation. Apple sets incredibly high standards for its employees, challenging them to deliver their best work. This commitment to excellence is visible in every aspect of the company, from product design to customer service. It creates an environment where continuous improvement is not just encouraged but ingrained in the company culture.

**Focus on Customer Experience:**
At Apple, the customer is at the heart of everything. The relentless pursuit of providing an exceptional customer experience is evident in the meticulous design of products and the dedication of customer support teams. The emphasis on understanding and meeting customer needs is a driving force behind the company's success.

**Dynamic and Fast-Paced Environment:**
Apple operates in a dynamic and fast-paced industry, and this energy permeates the workplace. The speed at which projects move forward can be both exhilarating and challenging. It demands adaptability and a proactive mindset, making each day unique and filled with opportunities for growth.

**Employee Well-being:**
Apple places a significant emphasis on the well-being of its employees. From comprehensive health benefits to initiatives promoting work-life balance, the company demonstrates a genuine concern for the welfare of its staff. This commitment fosters a positive work environment and contributes to the overall job satisfaction of employees.

**Global Impact:**
Being part of a company that has a global impact is incredibly fulfilling. Apple's products touch the lives of people around the world, and knowing that your work contributes to this impact adds a sense of purpose to your daily tasks. The scale of Apple's influence on technology and culture is both humbling and invigorating.

**Room for Growth and Development:**
Apple recognizes the importance of investing in its employees. The company provides ample opportunities for professional growth and development, whether through training programs, mentorship initiatives, or exposure to diverse projects. The focus on continuous learning ensures that employees stay at the forefront of their respective fields.

In conclusion, my time at Apple was more than just a period of employment; it was an enriching experience that shaped my professional journey. The company's commitment to innovation, excellence, and its people creates a unique workplace environment that is both challenging and rewarding. I carry forward the lessons learned and the inspiration gained during my tenure at Apple with immense gratitude.

Cons: Work-life balance, demands 6 days availability for full-time retail workers.
Advice: None
Pros: This is the best corporate company I ever worked for. Great benefits, decent pay, and amazing company culture with a strong emphasis on inclusiveness and diversity, and supportive leaders who genuinely care about their employees. The company provides career development programs and learning benefits to expand my skills and knowledge outside of my role.

Cons: The focus on "our people" has waned considerably over the last 5-6 years. Business focus used to be on the customer and employee experience, first and foremost, but these days, the micromanaging and excessive and aggressive push on numbers makes the job feel like a commission-based sales gig, which is the complete opposite of what it's supposed to be. They say that we must always "assume positive intent" with all interactions, but it really doesn't happen much anymore, especially between managers and employees. Also, the health insurance isn't as fantastic as they make it out to be. It's good, but not great, especially with regard to medication coverage/allowances.
Advice: Get back to basics and return to a people-focused platform. Nobody likes being micromanaged, especially when managers' primary function on the sales floor is exclusively "training," rather than helping the team or dealing with customer service issues. You lose a massive amount of respect from your employees when the highest-paid individuals in the store do the least amount of physical work, especially in an environment that, these days, typically assumes negative intent.
Pros: Most of the benefits are fantastic, and depending on the location, it can be a very stress-free environment. The company's credo and ethos are both ideal and inspiring.

Cons: The world's most profitable company has employees who live in their car or have to forgo dinner to pay rent. It's overall mind-blowing that the team gets paid so little in comparison to what corporate employees make.
Advice: Be you. Be open. Be humble. Be ready for feedback. You get what you give. At the end of the day, it's a retail job.
Pros: Great values for the environment, inclusion and diversity, and doing what's right. Fun, flexible, and generally easy job for great pay.

Cons: Chat support agents are on almost constant doubles or triples, differing from when first hired in mid 2010's where there would be 5-10 minutes before a second chat came in and often a few minutes between each chat if you finished quickly. The pace is overwhelmingly fast and demanding - there are no accomodation options that allow less than that number of incoming chats. If you cannot keep up with 3 chats +3 more possible if escalation is needed while researching each customers issue using multiple internal resource options and Google as well as keeping your case notes updated on a response timer of 60 seconds or so including internal help requests, you will need to find another place of employment as there are not other options.
Advice: Provide options for reduced volume or the option to set self away to avoid another incoming chat when dealing with difficult cases or as needed for disability reasons.
Pros: Benefits are great, most team managers are good, coworkers are great

Cons: Apple will not allow you to work remotely due to the tax breaks it gets from cities for bringing workers into its offices. The RTO policy is reinforced by out of touch leadership who have private offices, executive assistants, and can afford to live close to the office and therefore can't understand what the fuss is about. Apple loves to pay lip service to its environmental values and work/life balance, but its RTO mandate serves neither.
Advice: "It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do." -Steve Jobs. Listen to the feedback from your employees who are fed up with RTO.
Pros: Smart, creative, and kind co-workers

Cons: This role is considered customer-facing though there is limited contact with non-employees and most of the role is backend processing. The role requires that work is based on AppleCare Support Center rules for scheduling and overall time management ( AKA micromanaged and timed tasks). Growth opportunities are limited in number and how often they come up within the group. Getting outside of AppleCare roles is difficult and it comes across that we are looked down on as unskilled and not worthy.
Advice: None
Pros: The benefits are good, expectations are well documented, and the facilities in the office are awesome. With medical, fitness, and cafe facilities in Austin.

Cons: The only way I could do that was if you wanted me too I could come and pick it out and then I can go pick up it from your place or
Advice: I’m gonna have some of the same ones that are coming up on my desk in my bedroom in a couple days I don’t have any other stuff in
Pros: I like the luxury version but the more I think of the better the watch looks I would rather not buy a new watch and not buy a replacement for

Cons: The whole companies ridiculous policies are just atrocious. You get no options to go anywhere in the company. The few “rotations” that at least used to come up are already decided upon before you even apply, so you’re probably not getting them. Need more money because the cost of living has skyrocketed? Sorry, best we can do is more call skills to handle. I’m fairly certain the positive reviews you do see on here are from nothing but muppets who have no opinion, and most likely didn’t even know how to do any troubleshooting when they left. 2/3 of the employees are just absolutely horrible tech agents who no matter how long they’re there, they still don’t understand how anything works. Sadly these are also the same people who get promoted to roles they have no business in like engineering. There’s a reason so many things in apple are always broken.
Advice: Whoever currently runs apple care is so out of touch with apple culture that all they’re doing is crashing it. Also there’s a huge lack of caring about the mental well being of employees.
Pros: Paychecks are ok, but for the things that they demand it’s definitely not enough.

Cons: - Long approvals, last minute changes - Leaders that some times do not acknowledge the team that worked on the project but instead take all the credit - For the most part, you'll need to figure out your own growth path
Advice: None
Pros: - Some of the smartest people you will work with - Depending on the team culture, you will feel that are you truly contributing to the greater good of helping others - Great and competitive benefits with tons of resources to help you navigate life - Depending on the project you are working on, you are able to meet various departments and grow new skill sets

Cons: Oppressive leadership, silent silos, little or no advancement, average pay
Advice: Unfortunately caught in the middle of empathetic and caustic supervision. Many business leaders have never worked in the marketplace as business professionals and don't have the affinity for business development as much as business processes.   This is frustrating for those with outside Apple experiences.
Pros: Amazing benefits, world class company, great systems, unique workflow processes

Cons: Development has been improving but it's impossible to get a corporate career experience, hard to get noticed by leadership
Advice: Give more opportunities to your highest potential employees, put them on advanced development plans and help them see a brighter future. Although turnover is lower vs other retailers, there are a lot of smart people who work there and get unnoticed. So we usually see the smartest ones leave to go on to work at other tech companies like Facebook, etc. with much better opportunities. And then we're left with the "leftover" employees who have no mobility and those are the ones who are unhappy more often and are not the high performers.
Pros: Managers care about you, but the hours can be tough when how busy it can get. Love the people I work with, they are all striving to better themselves.

Cons: scheduling sucks. It is always blamed on the fact that its "retail," but every Apple Store is different.
Internal growth and pursuit of a leadership position is almost seemingly impossible. It seems that you either need to be an external hire, or know someone that's high up leadership (senior manager and up).
Advice: Promote from within.
Promote from within.
Promote from within.
Promote from within.
Promote from within.
Pros: Benefits, Pay is decent for my position, job security

Cons: Retail scheduling is better than other places but 5 days of availability/closing availability/and weekend availability are still mandatory. Promotion/hiring interview process favors story tellers over performance. Discourages discussion of wages among employees which suggests wage vs experience discrepancies, especially among team members who were hired at different locations and transferred.
Advice: None
Pros: *ESPP &amp; RSUs *Health/Vision/Dental/Mental Health benefits *PTO for full and part time employees (Vacation/family/Sick) *Education reimbursement *Fitness reimbursement *Free Apple services (music/arcade/fitness/Apple TV+) *Product discounts for yourself (25%) and friends and family (15%) renews yearly

Cons: Apple uses corporate language to a religious extent to make you feel like your attending a church service or a team huddle. they rally you together and make you believe what you're all slaving away for is attainable if you work hard enough and follow the apple credo. They give false hope, they lie to you nicely, they conceal their motives. They do not follow through with promises. They have you work harder for less money under the pretenses of doing an "experience" for a job they wont ever promote you to in order to get free labor out of you.
Advice: Provide a clear path to promotion, have your leaders actually listen to people and drop the corporate mask to understand the department they oversee and for the love of god follow through.
Pros: When I started this job I was young without a degree and they offered me stability higher than average pay, insane benefits and cool toys. I met lots of similar people. Its like college but a job.

Cons: - no expectation of work life balance
- mandatory early / late night meetings with short notice (calls with international vendors)
- unhappy middle management
Advice: None
Pros: - incredible coworkers
- super cool products + projects
- high level of autonomy in business decisions and negotiations

Cons: poor work life balance low empathy for workers high stress heavily micro managed
Advice: Apple leaves too much control to store leaders whom recreate the credo how they see fit for there store. This leaves opportunities for diversity, empathy for workers, workload management ,poor compensation for work and the list continues. Apple currently faces struggles with unions because of this and store leaders push anti-union downloads(meetings) to the workers while exercising polices to push out legacy and tenured employees. Truly a sad thing to see happen to the brand while it hits new record highs for profit.
Pros: Healthcare dental 401k Off on Sundays discounts on entertainment

Cons: - Management skill may vary
- Never compensated for going above and beyond
- Dealing with ambiguity at a dangerous level
- No room for growth depending on leadership
Advice: - Be transparent and stop creating a toxic work environment. 
- Stop playing favorites
- Take ownership of mistakes and actually fix them
- Employees are more than just numbers
Pros: - Easy Job
- Great benefits

Cons: - poor scheduling practices: lead to inflexibility and inequality of hours and times 

- poor management and leadership: led to petty store politics, cliques, and favoritism. Often did not feel supported by management, and resorted to working with heads of department or coworkers for problems that management could have handled easily. 

- pay and raises: incredibly frustrating pay system. Salary was based on a rigid formula of performance, position, cost of labor (not cost of living) in your area, and the salary you started with. There was no nuance or humanity or sensibility to the way employees were paid. It was all up to the pay formula equation. So for example, store transfers and new hires would frequently make 20%–40% more per hour than employees with the same job who had been working at the store for many years, because their starting salary was higher (whether from starting in a location with a higher cost of labor, or starting more recently after a minimum wage had increased). Managers and leaders seemed to have their hands tied when it came to fixing this.
Advice: None
Pros: - organized, structured, and corporatey: instruction manuals for literally every task, and clear order of operations for every single interaction you had. This made the job easy, if monotonous, for people who do well with structure, and frustratingly rigid for those who didn't enjoy structure/rules. 

- benefits were really what made it worthwhile to work there: great stock options, discounts on apple products, industry discounts on phone service plans

Cons: - Very minimal growth opportunities - Management is a hit or miss - Slight favoritism - Very repetitive and boring work - Skills learned aren’t very transferable - Most people work a second job as pay isn’t great specially for living in San Diego
Advice: The majority of management were hired externally so they don’t understand the work the analysts do. They push you hard to meet certain metrics when realistically a human being cannot sit in front of a screen for 8 hours a day and submit over a thousand tasks a day. Since management has never done this work, I would suggest they have certain days out of the week where they too have to endure what the analysts go through on a daily basis. I also suggest that instead of management spending so much time and focus on engagement activities and team lunches, they should focus that energy on advocating for higher pay for the analysts.
Pros: - Low stress - No deadlines to meet - Great people to work with - Great Benefits - Stock options and discounts - Hybrid schedule

Cons: - Bad Vacation (starts at 12 days per year)
- Okay Benefits (but worse then Google, Meta, etc.)
- The culture is great for some people but terrible for others. Very political, and it can be hard to get things done.
Advice: None
Pros: + The FTE people I have all met are all really smart, but working with contractors can be rough
+ Good comp
+ Great Executive Leadership

Cons: I think the cons are how busy the store can get, customers, and setting proper expectations with them.
Advice: None
Pros: Working at Apple is one of the greatest things that ever happened to me. Even as a part-timer, the amount of benefits I have is enormous. The support from the team and leadership is also immense as well and I feel that I can get help whenever needed.

Cons: The culture is not always ideal
Not always heard
Faux growth mindset
Advice: Connect with the team on a genuine level, not only for stories 
Pros: Lots of benefits 
Options for mental health
High pay for entry level 
Lots of training, well prepared

Cons: No work life balance and if you are on a low visibility project you will not get recognized nor will you get a stock refresher. Also very political make sure you know what the asks are before doing extra work.
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to learn very fast paced.

Cons: You are incredibly, incredibly expendable. Not just in a “we’ll hire someone new” case, but in the case of “we will ignore any and all health issues you have.” The only thing that matters is throughput, we are all just bodies to make Tim Cook more billions, even if it means breaking labor laws to do it.
Advice: On a store level: The entire leadership team for my market should quit. For a company whose credo is “our soul is our people,” no one in higher management seems to give a damn about the people who actually keep their store moving.
Pros: At this point, just the salary and benefits. Four or five years ago, the culture might have been a plus, but now? Not really.

Cons: - Management don’t listen to employees - Lot’s of people with special interests (i.e. political hacks) - The Apple values pallet (focus on quality, collaboration, etc) is used to mop the floors on my team
Advice: Listen to employees. The slavery age has long ended.
Pros: Overall a good company to work for, but the management seems to think they own the employees and so treat them like slaves. Do everything you are told to and don’t ask any questions. Wideout unpopular forced return to the office is just one example of lack of respect for the employees.

Cons: Growth within retail is not based on your own skills but well you can speak/answer the questions to what they value at that moment. Sometimes they follow a structure and sometimes they don't.
Advice: None
Pros: Improves your conservational skill with class of society especially dealing with ambiguity. Many benefits especially for improving education and many opportunities to grow in the company.

Cons: It can be harder to get new headcount or justify travel these days
Advice: None
Pros: When the rest of tech is laying off employees, Apple seems to be making a commitment to not be in the same boat. Really appreciate this in a workplace.

Cons: Like any place or big company. Management can make or break someone’s career. - Adding more responsibilities without any sort of pay raise - RSU stocks instead of a bonus. Long time for the RSU stocks to vest - poor training when it came to launching new products/software - lack of support in movement or growth - provided org wide development time but not able to schedule it or use it at all - reaching out to other sides of apple is difficult to learn about different roles throughout apple.
Advice: - allowing the advisors time to schedule what they want their development time. 2 hours a quarter is a joke. And forget about getting a mentor if you have to take that same time to “learn” from my mentor. It is unrealistic. If someone is trying to have a mentor teach them how to do a new role. 2 hours in three months does not cut it. - micromanaging leads to toxic work environment
Pros: Great benefits, discounts, free or included services, wonderful co workers, also great holiday pays. Also in senior support you have tools that can help the customer and you have the ability to make that choice on the spot I stead of having to get approval. - programs that are provided help you learn new skills - new mentoring program gives advisors who work from home to interact with others through apple beside their own teammates - visual documents that allow you to navigate some of our newest devices, and os’s - the health benefits really did cover a lot more than expected - some support when it came to disability short or long term were very good. - getting accommodations took a bit but were able to be honored up until recently for myself. - discounts on apple products (new and old) - set schedules for 6 months at a time - pay differential for shifts that start after 1pm CST - sick and vacation time was pretty good. Got better as you become more senior in the company. - you get swag and there are employee enrichment opportunities every week. - thanksgiving and around Christmas have some of the best pays throughout the year. - encouraged mentoring others The reason for my ranking is because of current status that I experienced before leaving Apple. When I first started in 2014 it was wild and crazy but we worked together to reach out and help. Over the years it has become less and less of an encouragement from the management side. Sure there were meetings and people seemed nice. But the reality of being able to reach out to one of those higher managers was frowned upon. When issues have been spoken about with treatment it fell on deaf ears. At some point you become disheartened because you know your voice doesn’t matter. It is this way or the highway. Because of that feeling you don’t feel any input provided will not be taken seriously. - the toxic environment has also driving away great management as well due to the lack of consideration for their input on current policies.

Cons: customers use you as an emotional punching bag, SOME managers don't really help out when needed, very obvious favoritism with employees. If you aren't a favorite you will struggle to move up! if you are a favorite, you got it in the bag!
Advice: It's fine to not like every employee, but when people work hard you should give them the credit they deserve.
Pros: good pay good insurance / benefits good time off

Cons: Apple closed multiple positions which fell into our laps. This position requires case management with added roles. You find yourself doing 5 people jobs and getting paid for just one.
Advice: Set proper expectations in terms of growth. 
Pros: Benefits
Stock
EPP
Bonus
Remote

Cons: This seems major but I've noticed a lack of opportunity for remote workers.
Advice: I'd love to see more upward movement in the remote space.
Pros: I've worked for several companies and I've never felt more cared for and respected. The lack of micro managing is important to me and Apple doesn't engage in that behavior, in my opinion.

Cons: Low pay. Overall sentiment from mid management and above is that workers aren’t trustworthy, need short chains, lack moras and therefore are not treated with dignity and respect. Like many organizations the main focus has shifted on just the dollar profit and not what value sets are the reason the company continues to have loyal customers.
Advice: Break down the negative bias and barriers that keep you from trusting the people you hired, allowing for more successful outcomes.
Pros: The culture and leadership intentions are generally positive.

Cons: Little room to grow, you can become very great at your job but positions rarely open
You can get what you want if you become cool with managers
Advice: Work very hard just like any place to build the skills to get where you want to go. Become close with managers.
Pros: Make good friends
Work on very low pressure
Work with small team
Depending on location you can switch to many other stores

Cons: You will be Micromanaged, stressed out about metrics all the time, and expected to handle each of your calls perfectly. If you don't get ready to hear about it from your manager. I was hospitalized and the only thing i was told was i would get a warning on my attendance after I used up will my sick time. It was just horrible. I couldn’t believe that one of the best companies in the world treated their employees this way. At the end of the day all Apple really cares about it sucking their employees and customers dry all for profit. Most of the time your manager will only comment on what your doing wrong and looking at metrics all the time is so draining and toxic.
Advice: Treat your employees better, be more compassionate and sympathetic. Don't only focus on the negative.
Pros: Decent pay, great benefits, work from home, opportunities to grow.

Cons: You have to compete with sells to make sure you can be considered for hours. So making sure u promote is something to consider.
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of hours and money is good if worked weekends.

Cons: Not very enjoyable and can be quite depressing and boring since there is little to no growth right now in the company. Unless you are a huge fanboy of apple or a college student I wouldn't recommend. very boring and unfulfilling job. but overall incredibly stressful and flag ships should be paid more.
Advice: None
Pros: . They are super flexible with work hours and time off it's crazy. also they do pay 5000 for school and other insane benefits. overall kind management but can be annoying to be told what to do especially if your standing for 8 hours and don't make commission.

Cons: There is a lot of politics and micromanagement that takes away from the greatness of the company. Thy push metrics like apple care for the benefit of the managers getting a bonus but the employees don't see any of those benefits
Advice: None
Pros: Working at Apple has great benefits, and they hire really cool people.

Cons: - The work/life balance can go for a toss
- The expectations are high
- The people I worked with were incredibly fatigued
Advice: None
Pros: - You will learn a tonne working on very impactful projects
- You will collaborate with the best people in your field
- The pay is amazing
- The accommodation is taken care of

Cons: Micromanaging, inability to move up in company unless you kiss up
Advice: Treat people like adults
Pros: You get Apple shares at a discount and good health insurance co workers are cool

Cons: My team is still remote so it was hard to get to know everyone and learn the job at the same time.
Advice: None
Pros: You works with smart people, and processes that are in place. Great onboarding. Cutting edge technology. Great work-life balance on my team and my manager is great.

Cons: The pay is not the greatest. They give you $0.50 raise and then want you to be happy about it. Apple is the richest company on earth, they can afford to pay a living wage.
Advice: Apple Corporate has not idea what in the world is happening at Apple Retail. Who ever runs Apple Retail should retire.
Pros: They are great about looking after you for the most part and they are considerate about your feelings and thoughts.

Cons: Interview: High bar for entry. Slow work pace: countless blockers from unstable internal infrastructure, overly limited resource, and inconsistent expectations of individual contributors. Isolating: Everyone holds on really tight to their own work, which creates unbreakable silos between projects, and there's not enough emphasis on infra scalability or standardization. Cult-like mindset: People here Complacency For example, if you go to an offsite, expect your manager to request money through Apple Cash. Everyone here is so proud of working for Apple, even when their work is not the most competitive on the market. Coming from a large scale web company that values fast pace, I had a really frustrating time adjusting to my org and team.
Advice: Be nice to people. Watch out for burnouts and politely turn down people's ideas / projects. Look outside of Apple's bubble for ideas to improve. Put down your Apple ego.
Pros: Everyone cares a lot of the details of the product, user privacy, and customer experience. Perfect place for perfectionist. Everything else depends on the org you're in. My org has great work life balance.

Cons: When I got hired, I was told I would get the job as a Cafe Barista which was what I was offered in the first place..... I ended up being some Service Rep for Caffe Macs--cleaning up after people if they dropped their food on the floor, checking water temps in restrooms, replacing milk pitchers, directing people where to line up for different food areas, adding sugar on top of custards and blowtorching, and other odd jobs required/asked. Company is very strict with being on time (clock in) is so damn far from the parking lot if you're lucky enough to find ANY parking space even if you arrive 45 minutes early. Different people training you are picky with how you're supposed to do the same job. They give you different opinions on what the other person does and doesn't agree with doing so you get stuck and confused....
Advice: Be more considerate to the new person trying their best the first month. There's no harm if a person is a minute or 5 minutes late. At least they showed up.
Pros: Company offers some good benefits.

Cons: Poor upper management. Lack of care for the individuals that work in stores.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and pay. Amazing insurance and stock purchase program. Lots of corporate discounts.

Cons: Working with a lot of young people and people that have been with Apple since they were young. Things can get political and inappropriate quicky without a strong store lead presence (which is often little to none)
Advice: Stay professional.
Pros: Benefits and schedule flexibility especially for students

Cons: You may feel discouraged after the multiple interviews but if you're listening and make the changes based on the observations they've seen, you'll find yourself being successful if you listen
Advice: None
Pros: An amazing culture with lots of resources

Cons: working on holidays and weekends. customers can be needy and learn at their own pace so you got to be patient. barely room for promotions. either jobs would be posted, you do an interview, and all of sudden job closes and management doesn't let you know.
Advice: promote your employees from within.
Pros: team, culture, benefits, inclusivity, discounts

Cons: -Customer Service is really the only con
Advice: Something I wish I would have done prior to accepting an offer with this department was do a little research. Apple is wonderful company to work for but they way they have there customer service set up is a little chaotic. They wanted to have you answer a call back to back to back. Sometimes the calls are major draining as some of the customers are just not reasonable. They expect you to bend over backwards for them because they use the product. Note not all customers are like this and most days were fine, but when you get those kind of customers you are drained after it. Hopefully in the future they will change that structure to limit the amount of burnout within the employees cause sadly that department has a high turnover rate because of this.
Pros: -Great team -Great benefit -Great Events -Great Environment

Cons: Hours are the same as any other retail establishment, which is great for people who can accommodate but not great for people that need a reliable schedule. Not many career options other than 'up' so once you get where you want to be the work becomes stagnant and the pay doesn't really increase.
Advice: None
Pros: Decently high pay depending on position Stock payout is matched each year Lots of tech certifications available Good Benefits

Cons: Management went down over the years
stagnant 
loss of motivation 
favoritism 
micro manage 
Advice: Maintain a professional relationship with your employees.
Pros: worked with friends
helped people
learned new things
recieved certificates for training
gained sales experience
gained technical support experience via in store and remote
proficient in MacOS and iOS


Cons: • Change management muscle isn't great in sales • Lots of process debt • Some sales leaders who haven't done the work/can't develop people
Advice: None
Pros: • Highly collaborative • Surrounded by passionate, intelligent people • Ability to innovate at all levels • Ability to chart your own sales execution path • Compensation includes heavy RSU • Takes care of their people during tough times

Cons: If you're a white male you'll be wherever you want in this company in no time. No matter how bad or how many times you report things to HR no "favorited" person ever gets discipline like their "business conduct" preaches. No women or mostly person of color ever moves past the company's expert role. I can only speak for the Upper New England stores, but seems like other stores around the country do feel the same. Also, an extreme cult atmosphere they work this way to keep the team together and feeling special for easy manipulation. They'll get you to do tasks beyond your job saying it's so that you can gain the experience for a promised position just to never deliver and keep you as a puppet.
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits and support for mental health.

Cons: A good work schedule is based on own's productivity.
Advice: None
Pros: Great product discounts for employees, work from home, and company stock ownership.

Cons: Upper management does not hire the best candidates for the job, if you do not fit their culture and know every Marvels, Star Wars show, or openly support PRIDE don’t expect to be promoted. Terrible pay
Advice: Start promoting those who perform the job best instead of those that drink from the company koolaid. Increase pay
Pros: The benefits and employee stock plan.

Cons: -your day is micromanaged
-every minute is accounted for
-unreliable schedule (not set) 
-strict time and attendance expectations 
-interviews are difficult
Advice: None
Pros: -fun environment
-plenty of weird people 
-lots of diversity
-good benefits 
-semi flexible work schedule 
-accommodation for student schedules 
-course tuition reimbursement (qualifying courses)

Cons: Worst customers I've ever had to deal with in retail, food service, or any other space I've worked in. The day to day treatment caused me to have a mental breakdown.
Advice: None
Pros: Best job I've ever had. I learned a lot of soft skills plus gained a tremendous amount of technological knowledge. The store management was all great (though their boss was a holy terror and we all hated when she came to the store). My coworkers were supportive and friendly. Were it not for the clientele, I could see myself making a career out of Apple.

Cons: Can be difficult to move into a full time role because there aren’t often open positions and is highly competitive when there are. Also speaking for this location in particular, you should be weary of ever voicing concerns to HR regarding upper management and you should also be cautious of how much you disclose about your health - mental or otherwise, but particularly mental health. There’s an ability to get job protection through Sedgwick with the amount based on what your doctor provides. However, if you need to utilize much of your given time for self care or even emergency situations that come up, be aware that management (not all but senior and above) will hold that against you, even voicing it at times. HR is not working for you, but the company. I’m not saying the values of Apple aren’t upheld because for the most part it’s a great place to work but it can become difficult and retaliation is a real thing there if you become deemed a liability of any sort. Also they will take advantage of certain roles and their workload/ actual duties particularly if they know that person is willing and wanting to help out, which is basically everyone at that store. Also don’t trust that your coworkers won’t be listening to anything personal you might be talking about with someone else — and if it is something that could give them an ability to tell management in the hope of advancing their own career path, they absolutely will. This might sound like it’s an overreaction or exaggeration however I only am sharing this info because the chance of being absolutely blindsided is something I came to find out has been happening to many of my former coworkers and people were taking extensive time off to deal with the need to keep their mental health stable or just outright looking for another job and leaving immediately upon another opportunity. For the most part though, the people who work there are a unique bunch, extremely helpful and it’s a mostly positive environment, at least on the surface you’re likely to not know what those being mistreated are feeling/ so it feels pleasant at least. Oh and one last comment is that if you get in any sort of position where they think it requires disciplinary action, the extent of why they feel you need it varies person to person (for instance being more than 2 minutes late clocking in for only 3 times can cause an extreme measure taken vs others being late almost chronically/ much more often and having no action taken) so there’s no sense of security as people aren’t all treated the same for doing the same actions or even worse ones. You will be targeted and treated poorly if you are at all deemed a liability or if you voice concerns or ‘feedback’ to upper management. So just be aware, it’s not truly as upholding of Apple values and policies as you might believe/ just stay aware of what you do and who is seeing it and keeping tabs on it. I would recommend never going directly to HR unless you seek out speaking to someone not connected locally because they won’t be on your side whatsoever in the twin cities area/ their relationships with management at these stores create an inability to be impartial so you’re not likely to receive any help nor will things change. This is speaking from personal experience as well as the experience of many of my coworkers who expressed similar issues in private. Again, keep your conversations out of any area where anyone could possibly walk by or be nearby because you cannot trust all of the coworkers there and you’ll likely not realize it either.
Advice: Oh boy. Ultimately to summarize it and not write out a litany of things that were done unethically and illegally, such as discrimination and targeting individuals. I’d suggest actually showcasing the values that the company and store claim strongly to believe in and follow. Inconsistent discipline and not speaking down to employees would be a great start. Using illness against them would also probably help to lessen the amount of people who have had to take lengthy time off for self care reasons. Also not delegating your own responsibilities onto people who shouldn’t have to be doing those tasks, and at the very least, acknowledging them for doing things that they shouldn’t have and management absolutely could’ve easily done themselves as is their job. I’d also suggest that if you’re the store leader, actually know the policies/ the bare minimum of information in order to be an actual resource vs just being someone who comes out onto the floor once in a while. Maybe take stock in your employees and also taking advantage of your position to never work shifts beyond only one would probably make your upper leaders and management feel more favorable towards you, but that’s only going off of what they’ve actually voiced. Who knows what other issues exist in private. Also maybe take note of how your employees feel towards you almost collectively so and consider that it’s not always them but probably you and how much you aren’t someone that should and is even able to help out in all situations. I’d also suggest being less obvious about retaliatory behavior and definitely not used protected time taken off for health reasons against the person as it’s also not legal to be saying a lot of the things you have said to more than just myself. Keep in mind it’s not conducive to a thriving and growing environment when management isn’t able to assist or isn’t even available to ask for assistance. It creates distrust and general frustration amongst your staff, whether you see it or not. Everyone else is noticing and speaking about their grievances with each other, believe me. Leadership should be there for the sake of leading their team and guiding them towards their goals and thereby enhancing the quality and strength of the store and ability to form more customer retention and positive experiences. Being indifferent or inept doesn’t go unnoticed and for Apple, it’s disheartening as well.
Pros: Great benefits, helpful and positive coworker atmosphere, yearly reviews to determine amount of raise.

Cons: There is a lack in career growth, specially at this position. Things are changing but it is uncertain how soon they will.
Advice: None
Pros: This is a great starting position if you don't have much work experience and your salary expectations are not high. You'll find that the community at Apple is amazing and that there are many great benefits that you can take advantage of.

Cons: Management has a lacks ability to help Doesn't accommodate disabilities well despite having so in years past Stop caring for employees suffering and trying to get better from long-covid Little to no remote options Bright and loud environments that are headache inducing especially older store designs that haven't changed. Customers complained too and I could only empathize because I endured migraines from working here. Little to no work/life balance
Advice: None
Pros: Stock Health Care Coworkers are supportive

Cons: - Micromanagement is extreme - Company "values" diversity by constantly pushing woke agendas and propaganda - Lack of development opportunities - Sexual harassment is not taken seriously If you don't want to get into management, you are better off starting as help desk staff at a company that supports PCs or both PCs and Mac. You will learn more and be more marketable.
Advice: Treat employees with respect. So much ego is carried in retail managers. It's incredibly toxic.
Pros: Great benefits--medical, dental, vision, tuition reimbursement, EAP, employee stock purchase plan, and restricted stock units.

Cons: Emotionally draining Apple support and retail not on the same page Some customers can be demanding, rude Or feel Entitled Can take years to be promoted Work hours can be inconsistent &amp; work and personal life balance can be challenging
Advice: Apple Retail pays extremely well. It is a great job for those who need another pt job, or don’t want to go to college right away. I encourage management to continue to have conversations with their staff. Check in to see if all is okay before and after shifts. The retail industry in general is taxing mentally. Since the average consumer has drastically changed over the course of a decade. Some customers are great and others can be verbally abusive, feel entitled, and will try to get what their way.
Pros: Supportive management Training Health insurance &amp; benefits Great hourly pay Take care of their employees

Cons: A demanding, Pointless, Culture of secrecy means nothing gets done. You file a bug report and you can’t even see it anymore.
Advice: First upper management has to realize there's a problem. Often they're so insulated from the day-to-day operations that they're clueless.
Pros: Great company to work for, love every second of it. Great culture and management.

Cons: Need more development opportunities. Company expects employees to go above and beyond for customers and does not extend that to said employees. More focus on mental health. Core values get lost along the way.
Advice: Be loyal to the employees who have bent over backwards for the company. Apple is a huge sea and often little retail employees get lost in that. Not been given any development opportunities in 3.5 years. Once received, it was cut short. Really frustrating. Retail employees have no child care options. From my perspective, I love this company. I love what it stands for. Going above and beyond isn’t hard when you love something. Working so hard to earn development opportunities and not getting them is frustrating and hard to keep the positive on. WFH retail employee given no opportunity to stay remote, only forced into one option. Return to store. There bas got to be a better way.
Pros: Great benefits and perks. Good pay. Wonderful and inspiring core values.

Cons: Management was a mess at times
People have trouble swallowing their pride working at Apple. 
No Humility by a lot of the staff which takes away from the customer experience.
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay
Cool Customers
Great Benefits

Cons: None I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Work culture is great in the retail space. The managers were awesome and most importantly the team was very supportive!

Cons: -Channel Retail division does not get held to the same standard as Retail and Corporate locations -This position is being downsized globally -Managers within Channel Retail division give raises arbitrarily vs merit-based -Managers will regularly expect you to be available on their time, regardless of your hourly schedule
Advice: Live by the expectations set upon you by corporate leadership. Commit to self-education around diversity, inclusion, and equity. Co-workers talk. If one employee does better than a peer on a review and receives a lower annual raise percentage than their lower performing peer, they will likely lose respect for you. Don’t pick on employees and openly play favorites. Don’t publicly make jabs at employees’ mental health.
Pros: -Global commitment to diversity and inclusion -Global commitment to pay equity -Opportunity to build relationships with vendor partners and customers daily -Pay is pretty good for what you’re expected to do

Cons: Redundant Leadership inconsistent with lean decision making.
Advice: None
Pros: Good Work-Life Balance with great benefits.

Cons: There are no cons for me
Advice: None
Pros: Liked the working environment it creates a space to excel

Cons: Can sometimes focus more on numbers than quality of work
Advice: None
Pros: Managers care about you as much as they do the customers. 
Good pay
Good incentives 
Mental health days

Cons: Turns out that I did not have a good match for Tech industry so I had to move.
Advice: None
Pros: I have had challenging and rewarding jobs. Good work-life balance.

Cons: I had 16 different managers over my 9 years with the company. the shift bids sometimes really messed up due to everyone working remote and different time zone formatting so you could end up moving from a 10 am start time to a 5 am start time. the bonuses are rewarded in stock vestments so if you leave the company or go on medical leave you lose the bonus you previously earned. They will say something if you clock in from break 30 seconds late too many times .

And even though the company has increased the amount of days you CAN take off, getting APPROVED for those days is another battle that will test you. -Pay is enough to survive market conditions, but for a $3T company, it’s not good enough for what we provide. -If not willing to relocate, you’ll hit a ceiling quick. -Very stressful and demanding role. Management can be difficult and unrealistic even if you are a leader in statistics amongst your peers/ the market.
Advice: Don’t whip the horse more than you should.

Cons: There is no work life balance. Micro managing by managers. Some young and disrespectful employees . Not a healthy environment to grow.

Cons: * Health insurance (United) has gone way downhill. They do their best to deny as much as possible. It is not free, so all 160K + employees are paying several hundred dollars a month just for United to say "No" even when you have a lengthy legitimate history for an issue, and your doctor's recommendation for a specific medication, surgery, etc. I imagine it's the same with other insurance providers (but don't know for sure), and it's gotten worse since covid.

* The AppleCare (AC) call center is bottom rung and looked down upon by corporate employees, therefore making a hard case as to why you should be valued and how your skills might transfer to another role, regardless of your educational background and work history. Basically, they see you as having no skill and no positive financial impact for Apple (i.e. you're not making Apple money because you aren't producing a product). There is a corporate side to AppleCare with various roles and positions that have nothing to do with being a front line customer service rep. I cannot speak to those positions. 

* Likely due to the above, near zero room for career advancement and growth, especially if you want out of AppleCare and don't have years of experience in other job roles, and/or don't have a connection to help get you out. 

* Pandering/patronizing programs to make one think/feel like there is career advancement opportunity when there really isn't. Not saying that no one makes it out of AC from these programs, but the odds are about the same as winning the lottery. Basically, you may be selected to work with other corporate organizations for up to six months, doing work you actually want to do, and getting treated like an adult, then you're sent back to AC and have to wait a year before you can apply again. Even if you crush it during that experience, these other orgs aren't given budget for headcount, so they can't hire anyone even if they wanted to. 

*A large portion of your fellow employees are either third party vendor call centers, or people who are poorly trained, or who just don't care, which is likely another reason why AC is looked down upon, and why employees are treated like children. This also causes frustrations for high performers that do care about the quality of their work, but management does not care as long as the numbers look good to their managers and so on up the ladder. 

* Upper management likes to play around with their organizations (one senior manager can be in charge of several different orgs under the same umbrella), so they'll randomly announce that your org and another org is merging, so now you have to learn a new product or service on top of what you're already supposed to have locked down (though the majority don't), and this can happen several times. In other words, you're hired to support a specific product and/or service, then suddenly they merge with another org, and another, and another and now you're supporting a variety of products and services - a jack of all trades and master of none, which means the quality of service takes a major hit, and to top it off you are not given a raise for all of the additional responsibilities you now have.

* Along with the above, for no reason at all they will move managers around to different teams. You might have an amazing manager that you've really connected with only to have them replaced by another manager that you barely know. If you have any kind of special accommodations, well now you've got to go through the wringer again with this new person. They will also randomly have you move desks within the office. Some people love to personalize their desk space with all kinds of things, and they definitely aren't fans of being moved around.  Again - just random changes for no reason at all. 

* AC doesn't hire based on where they are short as it relates to shift start/end times. In other words, if AC needs employees for the 11am to 8pm shift, they don't specifically hire for that shift. Instead, everyone has changing schedules, so every six months your life could potentially be uprooted. You might work 6am to 3pm half the year, then suddenly you're working 11am to 8pm the other half of the year. Say goodbye to being there for your children's after school program or extra curricular activities, etc. 

* I do not recommend working a customer service role, such as AppleCare, for Apple. I'm sure that it is significantly better than working for some other company's customer service department, but if you actually want a career where you can grow and move up within the company, this is not the place for you.
Advice: See the cons, then make appropriate action plans based on that.
Pros: * Great dental and vision.
* Great assistance programs.
* Good food on campus that is cost effective Nice campus and campus amenities (gym, medical offices, coffee and juice bar, walking trail, etc).
*I would recommend working for Apple if you've got the education and experience related to developing the products and services that Apple sells, however I do read/hear that for SWEs there is zero work/life balance, though well compensated.

Cons: Nothing bad..great across the board
Advice: N/A
Pros: Best place to work for.

Cons: There is nothing in the Apple phone room but misery, regret, and anxiety. You will be micromanaged on everything and persistently treated as if you are a child attempting to skirt the responsibility of the job itself. You will also be given metrics that are impossible to achieve, like “did you fix the customer?”. Apple sets itself apart from other phone rooms by having every department in the phone room cross trained in every other department of the phone room. Quiet hiring is a term used recently in the media. This way, you take on the responsibility of supporting other departments, and fulfilling the role of other positions, while keeping your same position and pay. You will very quickly be trained to support every Apple device, across every Apple service. This way they keep us at their goal of 100% productivity. Want to prove yourself and put in multiple years of service? There is no escaping the phone room. You will be worked until burn-out, and then you will seek any escape possible.
Advice: Most management is great there.
Pros: Benefits Campus has a nice cafeteria, gym, ect.

Advice: Don’t let the speed of execution stop you from taking time to share gratitude.
Pros: The core values of this company run deep. Coworkers are an amazing support network. I have to demonstrate deep expertise in my field but I am also constantly learning and challenged.

Cons: Micromanaging seems to be a theme for Leads and for those of which have who are in a lead experience. Innovation is preached constantly but never fostered practically and almost discouraged if the manager/supervisor has to remember anything. One on one temperature check meetings are a little often forgotten.
Advice: Practice innovation and welcome it wholeheartedly not just treating it as an extracurricular but honor the innovator with grace rather than being quick to dismiss it. Also be accountable to your meetups being fine to admit managerial errors as they happen. Be about the greedo set in place. Make a plan with and for exiting employees that doesn’t prioritize negative feedback on their way out.
Pros: Coworkers are all invested and interesting people. There is a lot of freedom when you are in an interaction. Teaching sessions works out great if you are passionate about serving your students. Part time benefits are awesome too!!!

Cons: The cons about working at Apple are, the hours, if you are in retail and the hours if you work in office. As a salary employee you are expected to work 50-60 hours a week.
Advice: Develop your team so that you don't have to work 50-60 hours per week.
Pros: One of the best reasons for working at Apple is that they develop skills that are transferable to any other industry.

Advice: None
Pros: Decent staff, work benefits and phone perks are great. Stock RSU

Cons: No commission. This is a huge one. Apple says it would ruin the culture but I don't believe that. You could divvy up a tiny percentage of total store sales and disperse that evenly throughout every employee in the store. There's a huge push to sell Apple Care and getting customers linked up with the Apple Business Team. Very limited amount of roles within the store and despite what you are told, the path to Corporate is likely 3-5 years no matter how awesome you are. No time off during launch season and the holidays. Working from September through the end of the year was an awful whirlwind. The pay is pretty low. This would be a great job for someone who just graduated High School but for other people with more years of experience in the workforce it's kind of painful.
Advice: None
Pros: Apple was a surprisingly great company to work for. They offer part-time employees benefits and there are a lot of resources available. The products kind of sell themselves and 90% of the customers you interact with in the store are pleasant.

Advice: None
Pros: Good team to work with, very diverse group of professionals.

Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits pretty good pay depending on your age great environment

Cons: work life balance was awful at times
Advice: None
Pros: Loved the time spent there

Cons: -everything. its apple. soulless greenwashing corporation -your treated like a prisoner who is chained to your computer. want a bathroom break? nope. came back from lunch 5 minutes late? sucks to suck, but here is a penality and if you do it again your fired -phony forced culture of positivity when in reality all apple does is rips its customers off with terrible policies -customers call you up and curse you out since they bought bad apple products, which makes sense -lots of insane policies that make no sense

Cons: Sometimes customer can be really rude
Advice: None

Cons: Intense work pace: Apple is known for having an intense and demanding work culture, with tight deadlines and high expectations. Pressure for results: As a data engineer, you may face constant pressure to produce results and innovative solutions quickly.
Advice: My advice for management is to prioritize work-life balance for employees while maintaining a culture of innovation and excellence. It's important to set realistic goals and deadlines, and to provide adequate resources and support to help employees achieve those goals. Additionally, fostering a culture of open communication and feedback can help create a positive and collaborative work environment that promotes growth and development for both the company and its employees.
Pros: Growth opportunities: Apple is one of the most innovative companies in the world, which means there are many opportunities to grow and learn as a data engineer. Salary and benefits: Apple is known for offering competitive salaries and excellent benefits to its employees, including health insurance, retirement plan, paid leave, and much more.

Cons: Strong discrimination issue from certain personal.

Pros: Easy to take advantage of woke policies at company for your benefit.

Pros: Great benefits and employee support.

Cons: Nothing bad other than long working hours
Advice: None
Pros: Some good some bad overall good

Cons: Management was a joke and would choose the worst people to hire for larger roles. If management didn't like you they would change your schedule to the worst floor positions Literally just management. IT IS A JOKE.
Advice: Hire better people for management roles They would promote technicians who knew nothing about the product and thus they would make horrible recommendations to the customers
Pros: Great Benefits Some Amazing Co-workers Work/Life Balance Super Easy Work if you know technology

Cons: They do not really have any cons
Advice: None
Pros: Healthy Workspace environment with tentative support staff.

Cons: Dealing with Apple and people

Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Have a good drive and

Cons: Could do better with 401K benefits
Advice: None
Pros: Has a open door policy to connect with leadership team

Cons: juvenile working environment, racist managers, retaliation in the work place from managers against employees, multiple sexual harassment investigations against senior managers in the store. A completely awful environment, met with alot of uncomfortable situations.
Advice: I believe that apple corporate needs to reevalute who they are hiring as the store managers and supervisors, as they are the people who shape the store and shape the outcome of employee performance but also the atmosphere. I believe that there should be a quarterly review of the managers. As well as the investigations shouldnt just dissappear or dissolve without addressing the entire store on the status of the outcome. Managers should be terminated for discriminations, retaliation, and harassment.
Pros: The pros were the endless resources on the peoples page for all apple employees, learning how to repair technology and troubleshoot infront of customers, and transportation reimbursements. The starting pay in NY for the technical specialist role $22.50 and goes up every 6 months, by the time I resigned I was getting paid $25.75

Cons: Some Management Issues
Coaching
Sales Goals
Advice: None
Pros: Pay
Benefits 
Stocks
People 
Health
Training

Cons: Dealing with customers can take a toll on mental health if not handled properly.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company. Takes care of you and tries to meet all needs.

Cons: Need more vacation days to take time off
Advice: None
Pros: Great work environment and team

Cons: Just the same challenges that any company of this size that has to maintain a modicum of secrecy around unreleased products and service offerings. That is: • Silos and disparate objectives between engineering group • Corporate doublespeak creates some confused directives • Certain departments have leadership that doesn't understand modern Agile project management expectations
Advice: Keep it up. This is a good company. The feedback culture is unique and makes employees feel valued.
Pros: The company has a great heart and the commitment to the customer experience is really unmatched. The leadership is generally good people who want to do right by people. The HR team puts employees first. They way senior leadership has dealt with the environment of layoffs has been amazing. It creates some unusual loyalty amongst the staff.

Cons: Not Good stuff going on at Apple
Advice: None
Pros: Good stuff going on at Apple

no work life quality
no backfills

ok pay for most positions

Cons: Poor software engineering practices
Too much emphasis on secrecy and leaking product announcements
Advice: None
Pros: Heavy discount on Apple products
Very good pay
Nice people
Impactful work

Cons: A big con was that there were no cons
Advice: None
Pros: Love being a pit boss

Cons: Some managers are tackless and negate ownership of miscommunication. I initially didn't care, but over time, the amount of "Apple Kool-Aid" these people attempt to dose out is gross. The pay and benefits are great, but working for a trillion-dollar company, you know they could do more (more vacation/sick hrs, covered healthcare, steeper discounts (more than 25%)..etc). There is no commission (a "pro" in many regards), but management still pushes numbers (hard)-- the reason being, they receive incentive bonuses on floor numbers. Even writing this out, I see the ultimate "con" to be how slimy the job can feel. Per standard retail employment, expect to work weekends, evenings, and long hours. Least to mention how insanely busy the store can be during product launches and holidays.
Advice: None
Pros: Great starting pay for a job that requires no prior experience ($22/hr); plus great health benefits (at PT + FT), employee discount (up to 25%), and people. The Keystone store has some solid managers and coworkers on both the sales and tech sides. If you are FWE, your chance of employment post-contract is 50/50.

Cons: Low pay Not movement &amp; little promotions No perks like other tech companies (food, snacks, open spaces for breaks limited )
Advice: Listen to all analysts not only those who wanted to be friends of management, that creates a culture of favoritism and nepotism which is a lot common to see. A good work atmosphere is not only for friends of management.
Pros: Flexible schedule Understanding management at some level Okay benefits Not as stressful as other departments in this company

Cons: Moving a lot, no time to breathe
Advice: None
Pros: Great work culture, flexible schedule

Cons: Bureaucracy, Political, Hesitant to do the right thing
Advice: Listen to your people. Don't wait until they go on leave until you act. There are a lot of great leaders at Apple, but there are far too many mediocre ones and way too many bad ones for a company of this stature.
Pros: Smart People, Powerful Brand, World Class

Cons: Not enough hours to accommodate
Advice: hold people accountable or nobody will learn.
Pros: good people with great attitudes

Cons: Growth in retail is a bit limited.
Advice: None
Pros: Great support

Cons: Can get stressful at times
Advice: None
Pros: Very disciplined execution and runs like a well oiled machine

Cons: Not many. Travel to CA, assist in retail stores with hours that are not 9am-5pm.
Advice: Add more bonuses! flex on work/life balance
Pros: Join Apple for literally hundreds of benefits, corporate development and team and peer support. A+

Cons: Apple could do better at blending the various departments to provide more seamless service to Business customers. Apple could also do better at managing turnover and better trained managers to understand how to better run store Business Teams.
Advice: You have created a mgt atmosphere in Retail Stores that is cut throat and all about rapidly progressing to the next promotion. You are too quick to look over or even run away good steady performers that were delivering great in store performance &amp; teamwork. To much emphasis is placed on “over performers” and high achievers who are anxious to get the next promotion - this adds to overall turnover, inconsistent leadership, and the tendency to cut corners and play fast and loose with company policies. The prior distinction of us versus “Big Box” competitors is fast going away.
Pros: Providing Business Customers with innovative technology and tools to better compete in the market place. Help a large array of customers from small to large, with numerous needs and problems to address. Training of products and ways to use Apple Technology is first rate.

Cons: The only thing that makes
Advice: None
Pros: Good, but the only way

Cons: Alot of customers will come and alot of customer traffic
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits along side great pay

Cons: There is no guarantee of a return offer. Because everything is team based, it really depends on how well you're able to make connections and find a team with available headcount which I think is fine, just know it in advance.
Advice: None
Pros: I loved working at Apple. Their intern program is great and it's a huge opportunity to learn from better software engineers if you let it be. Plus, the campuses are beautiful.

Cons: Outdated remote policy 
Lateral team moves nearly impossible

Cons: -random scheduling -have to work at least one weekend day -the customers are incredibly rude and entitled -incredibly understaffed -metrics are recorded and you’re constantly told how you are doing -little upward mobility even though that’s something they say they have. -works with Sedgewick, one of the worst companies with the worst leave policies.
Advice: There needs to be more full time opportunities. Stop the union busting. Hire more people. Pay us more.
Pros: -decent hourly pay for the job -some flexibility with scheduling -paid sick and vacation time -discount on apple products -free apple services

Cons: Some customers can be difficult to work with, lack of consistent schedule and need to work nights and weekends

Advice: None
Pros: Pay is very competitive
Culture is great
management cares for you

Cons: Bad training curriculum and advancement
Advice: None
Pros: Good positive atmosphere and peers

Cons: Management does communicate and never aligns with Apple policies. They say they care about their employees mental health and wellbeing but when it actually comes down to serious life problems they turn away. Unsupportive and could careless what you’re going through. The work load is insane, you’ll be dealing with a lot of disgruntled customers. While you might be getting paid decent, it doesn’t make up for the mental abuse you’ll have to take from customers. Managers will not be there to support either. They like to turn their backs on you in situations like that.
Advice: None
Pros: Good Benefits and great pay

Cons: bureaucracy, stack ranking, lack of transparency, politics
Advice: None
Pros: work life balance, caring employer, nice colleagues

-Development limited and competitive
-Some leadership may sometimes lack core experience in the departments they lead.
Advice: None
Pros: -Good Benefits
-Good Discount
-Flexible for students
-Inclusive Culture

Cons: Lip service. You are sold on the idea that the opportunities are limitless, but what they don't say, is, if you're will to jump through these hoops, play the politics, and are okay with being diminished. While there I experienced racism from customers, on more than one occasion, and when attempting to address it, you get the run around, and then they asked me to prove it, and to get others to testify about their racist encounters that were tolerated. I tried, but I kept getting the same response, "I tried to talk to them about it, and they brushed it off."
Advice: Actually listen to your team members.
Pros: The Pay, and some flexibility with the schedule, if you're in school.

Cons: no one seems to move up

Cons: Lack of AC all in All good
Advice: n/z
Pros: Food and Water free and good coffee

Cons: Open offices are noisy. Headphones are required.
Advice: Give me a quiet place to work, and I'll stay for another 20 years!
Pros: I've been a software engineer at Apple for 10+ years, and it's a great place to work except for one huge flaw: Almost all of their work environments are open offices. It's impossible to concentrate, and almost everybody complains about it. Nearly every open seating area is full of people wearing headphones, and you don't even have enough desk space to view your monitor and laptop side-by-side. If you decide to apply for a job here, be sure to ask one question in your interview: "Will Apple provide me a quiet workplace where I can concentrate without having to wear headphones?" I love Apple, and if they'll fix this problem with their offices, I'll probably stay for the rest of my career. Otherwise, I'll most likely leave within a year.

Cons: Nothing all was great here
Advice: None
Pros: Learned a lot it’s a great company

Cons: - Stressful - Salary good, but not particularly competitive with similar companies - Senior mgmt tends to give priority to business decisions and design over pure engineering concerns
Advice: None
Pros: - Great benefits - Driven, competitive environment - Ample resources for work - Surprisingly unrestrictive for such a huge corp.

Cons: stressful and long hours and high pressure
Advice: None

Cons: Lack of work life balance.
Advice: None
Pros: Innovation and collaboration, fast paced.

Cons: Politics can completely consume projects requiring a lot of additional effort. Lots of layers of management in some areas. Stupid return to office policy with no data driving any of the process.
Advice: Flatten the org's so that there are clear lines of communication about what's going on. Allow teams to set their own more-liberal remote policies
Pros: RSUs Product discounts Engaged employees in many parts of the company Room to explore

Pros: Great hours great hours great

Cons: no cons currently. have been happy
Advice: None
Pros: great place to work and i love it

Cons: Managers would stand outside the bathroom timing how long employees were in there. Any time you called in you were “letting down the team.” The store manager was manipulative and had weird boundaries with female employees. One manager had zero empathy for mothers and eventually quit after she had children claiming it was “too much.” There are definitely favorite employees such as a part timer who was conveniently moved to full time (receiving benefits including maternity leave) less than a week before having a baby and then had a position “created for her upon return.” It was just a wild place to spend multiple years of my life trying to attain something that was never possible. There was constant talk of positivity and assuming positive intent but most of the managers were not doing that for their own employees.
Advice: None
Pros: Great insurance, benefits, amazing co-workers.

Pros: Working there was a positive experience with coworkers and management that always had your back and were there to support you. The work is interesting and engaging, especially if you like customer interaction.

Cons: Some political games when trying to get promoted
Advice: None
Pros: Development, challenging, benefits, pay, work life balance

Cons: Not the company for entrepreneurs. Your ideas are owned by Apple when you work there. Furthermore, Apple hires micromanagers in retail to keep you in line. If you want to do something innovative, you will be shot down. Very small-minded management. It works for them, obviously - the Apple experience is fairly consist at across all locations, but if you are not one to drink look-aid, you will get frustrated very quick.
Advice: None
Pros: Apple is a great company to work for if you don’t know what you want to do in life. You pretty much have job security, a low-medium salary, and lots of fun stuff to do everyday. They give you the rails to stay within, you do your job, and everyone is happy.

Cons: Can definitely work on standardising pay
Advice: None
Pros: Great company to work for and great culture

- Repetitive
- The customers really make or break the job
Advice: None
Pros: - Many benefits
- Competitive pay
- Networking is easy

Cons: No pathway from Retail to Corporate. Corporate employees look down on Retail employees. No work from home opportunities even though the company is capable of creating those opportunities. Inclusive on the Retail level, not inclusive AT ALL in the corporate level.
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing benefits. Flexible hours. Pathways to Management level. Apple brand is not going anywhere.

Cons: Some downsides is the lack of guidance for advancement opportunities, they never list wages of positions so you are always shooting blind with high hopes. Work life balance isn’t the best but if you can reserve time off in advance you can make a good system for yourself
Advice: None
Pros: Great with inclusivity Very understanding of your personal life and things that unexpectedly arise. Very supportive in wages and compensation along with time away

Cons: it is high pressure usually.
Advice: None
Pros: Rate a Company is Great

Cons: Ok ok ok ok ok
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits were good there :)

Cons: Toxic customers, annoying wokr schedules and low pay
Advice: None
Pros: Nice coworkers, managers and employee benefits

Cons: Internal secrecy and confidentially can mean a lot of duplication of effort at times, especially as the number of products grows. Current remote work policies also seem out of touch with the modern post-pandemic idea of work/life balance and talent retention.
Advice: None
Pros: Apple is a great place to work in terms of innovation and culture with a functional organization structure that makes product development mostly consistent and fun.

Cons: the pay left lots to be desired
Advice: None
Pros: enjoyed interactions and environment all around

Pay
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits
Flexibility 
Remote Work
Pays for School

Cons: Can be micro managed sometimes
Advice: None
Pros: Free stocks, great company, amazing benefits and culture

Cons: managers could define store environment favoritism people define the workplace differences in pay impossible to negotiate pay no support from managers in certain instances "no retaliation policy" (no chance to defend yourself") if 10 people choose that they don't like you because of that policy a made up story could be made and you could get fired.
Advice: management needs to be very open minded at apple in order for a this company to succeed at a retail level. I understand that many other apple retails love the store and love the environment they are in and love coming into work because of how the people are and how management is. Some stores build up horrible cultures and target certain people which can be horrible. Career development at stores vary depending on how good management could develop in-store talent. I worked at 3 different stores and at my past 2 stores I loved coming into work because it felt like I wanted to be there.
Pros: good pay for retail nice people plenty of opportunities for corporate stock plan benefits

Cons: There is a lot of workload
Advice: None
Pros: The company culture is great

Cons: Sometimes noisy 
Super fast paced
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance
Upper management cares
Good benefits for part time
Discount
Team is solid
Everyone gets feedback
Multiple breaks

Cons: Moving up in retail or going to corporate is very difficult.
Advice: None
Pros: Everyone will tell you that it is the best you can get at a retail level.

Cons: While the culture is generally positive there is some micro passive aggression that occurs and the bigger picture usually loses the vote to low hanging fruit. The business team's ceiling is fairly low. There are two roles, Business Expert and Business Pro which are pretty easy to promote through in a couple of years but after Pro there are no next steps in store for Business team members. Getting to corporate is definitely possible but requires a longer journey. Current economic situation does not help either. Internal processes lack structure as well.
Advice: There is no such thing as a one size fits all solution. Different departments / teams have different needs. Learning to adjust and tailor solutions based off of the business needs will help retain talent and keep morale high.
Pros: Positive environment, promotes healthy communication, company culture is welcoming, safe, and fun. Apple definitely changes your approach to life and encourages you to slow down and seek understanding, accept people as the unique individual they are, embrace ambiguity, and seeing opportunity in rejection, redirection, or undesired outcomes.

Cons: Busy, fast, long days, wow
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: A great company to work for if you're the right person. If you are not good with people at all, this job may not be for you. Personal and communications skills are a must to enjoy or at least be efficient at a role here.

Cons: working hours are quite long
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay and rsu options

Cons: Very demanding and the work life balance wasn't ideal.

Cons: Why will you need the discounts..?!? Because you’ll never see anyone you love and care about ever again..!! They are slave drivers, who hire approximately 85% of their staff as “part-time” (with the promise of full time, but that’s just your basic corporate scam), but work them at almost a 40 hour week, every week, except the last two of each quarter. See, they follow California state law for employment, which states you can work a part-time employee as many hours as you want, as long as the last two weeks of the quarter average below 25 hours a week. Sooo…. Good luck with a vacation, they don’t exist (work/life what..?!?). They do this to get as much work from their employees as possible, without having to pay them full time hourly rates and benefits. Plus… Because you’re not listed as full time, you’re not eligible for short-term disability, regular price break points on health insurance, proper sick time, regular vacation breaks (outside of a day off here and there, they are closed two days a year, Christmas &amp; Thanks Giving, outside of that, I’ve seen people fired for asking for a week to spend time with their families), regular unemployment, really nothing but two cotton shirts with an Apple logo on them, twice a year. My manager, nor ANY of the managers at the store, OR when I transferred to phone support from home, had ANY CLUE AT ALL about employment law and what you can &amp; can not ask or say to an employee, what proper break hours are for hours worked, the reverse sexual and racial discrimination is MINDBLOWING…. The list goes on and on and on. I’ve been in the business world for 33 years and I can honestly say… Worst employment experience I’ve ever had in my entire life, just a miserable, MISERABLE environment..!!!
Advice: Use part of that three trillion a year to treat your employees as members of the human race.
Pros: Very nice (yes, I intentionally used exceptionally basic words) ability to buy into Apple’s stock plan at 15% below the close price of the stock on a biannual basis, set at the end of January and July. Ability to use a plethora of 15% off family &amp; friends discounts right from the start, well…. After 90 days. For most items, it’s 10 items a year you can give your 15% off discount away and trust me… You’ll need it..!!

Cons: Lots of mean and dorky individuals who try to show off by dismissing others
Advice: None
Pros: Fun and interesting job, some really cool people and a good manager

Cons: General retail gripes: The hours are all over the place (7am-4pm one day, 10am-9pm the next day, etc.) Customers can truly suck the life out of you. Store culture is directly influenced by the Store Manager. If you have an understanding manager, then it's all good. But I've heard horror stories at other locations. No tipping from customers allowed. The internal interview process is confusing and inconsistent. You are treated like you are interviewing for a corporate leadership role, even if applying for a full-time position from part-time at the same experience level. It's just retail, folks!
Advice: More schedule flexibility. Better pay, especially in larger markets.
Pros: Best retail job you could have. Nice benefits, vacation and sick leave, even for part timers. Discounted stock buy-in options, nice discounts on personal purchases, fun environment. All inclusive and supportive of LGBTQ+, minority groups, etc.

Cons: Be prepared to work really hard under a lot of micromanagement. You will have to deal with a lot of people and social interaction, some of which will be conflicts. It is difficult to move up within the company past a certain point. Like it would be easier to become a manager there by being a manager at a different retail store and applying then trying to rise from within. You can go from sales to technician pretty easily though.
Advice: None
Pros: Excellent benefits. The pay is decent for a job that doesn't require a college degree. The training is great and will help you in future jobs.

Cons: Work life balance can be improved, but it could also simply be working within Finance
Advice: None
Pros: Friendly, smart, hardworking people and opportunities to move teams to explore a different type of finance (Retail, Corporate, Sales, etc)

Cons: Can be tiresome. Long hours sometimes.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance and pay.

Cons: Teams are very siloed, so you don't really communicate or work with others outside your immediate fellow engineers. Management style therefore is highly variable between teams. SWE pay is still top of the industry, but lags behind a select few companies.
Advice: None
Pros: Strong name on resume. Good cafeteria food. Growth opportunities are plentiful. Work-life balance varies depending on season (summers are more lax) and team. Work is never boring.

Cons: No pros to share at this current time
Advice: None
Pros: Great people great values and great work environment with benefits

Cons: Dry promotions always. People leave and others who are already overworked absorb the work, modern slavery if you will.
Advice: Set your employees up for success, they work hard and often sacrifice personal time for a “good job” only.
Pros: The benefits are great and the campus is beautiful.

Cons: Hard to get promoted. Undertones of caring for people being outweighed by businsss. Same as all retailers.

Pros: The health benefits are amazing

Cons: Need better pay for hospitality team and those who are not engineers that works for the company.
Advice: None
Pros: Top company to work for

Cons: Working in a mall is horrible. Also, when you have a store front that holds 200 people and they fit 400 in there is a horrible experience. I would not recommend if you do not like large crowds or very loud areas.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company to work for. Pay and benefits are exceptional.

Cons: nothing to say here now
Advice: None
Pros: To work on great products

Cons: You have to wear many different hats
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay for retail work

Cons: Project deadlines, precipitous pressure can stifle innovation
Advice: Difficult time with upper management (including CEO) saying this Company is for young people. I have mentored engineers for 27 years at company, contributed to the OS, 40 years total in industry, not a company for 60 year olds, I suppose. I wish there a program for loyal, older, contributors to be offered positions with reasonable hours, without having to part with company (on amicable terms). “Demotion” is not supposed to be a bad word… more time for other things in life is not a bad thing. I don’t want to work until I drop. Therefore, I am going back to my first love, which is teaching... Math, Science, Chemistry, Physics, Languages (I only speak 8, so sorry) + Tutoring
Pros: Creative environment, do things better, different

Cons: Decisions can take a long time due to vigorous debate and need to involve too many stakeholders.

Pros: overall i liked it apple is apple

Cons: There is no cons really
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible schedule for the week

Cons: Lack of creative freedom Tendency to justify legacy design decisions. New design proposals are only entertained if the work is done on your own time. For the above reasons, the work may not always feel rewarding.
Advice: None
Pros: Detailed oriented work. Xf teams are great to work with and are very willing to share knowledge in their domain.

Cons: pretentious coworkers were interesting to work with
Advice: try harder
Pros: They were interesting to work for 

Cons: •Not flexible scheduling. They don’t let you choose your hours/days. With full time they let you choose your days off, but they don’t let you choose your available hours. So if you have another job or school, your screwed. This job would be good for someone who doesn’t have anything going on outside of work or you have flexible school.
Advice: None
Pros: •Very good benefits •Valued team member •Growth opportunities •Paid training

Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Benefits and Salary. They really care about developing their employees.

Cons: Only 12 days of vacation per year in the first 3 years at company. Incompetent AI ML platform and poor infrastructure . No Career Growth
Advice: Be more risk taking on AI ML. The world is changing fast with lightning speed of development on AI ML. If Apple does not strive hard, be more open, Apple can lose the game to Google, Microsoft, etc. Maybe Apple already lose in some areas except for Hardware.
Pros: Good compensation Good health benefits Good Culture and Friendly Poeple

Cons: You can burn out pretty easily
Advice: None
Pros: Tuitions reimbursement, benefits for part time employees,

Advice: None
Pros: Excellent work environment. Smart people. Ethical and honest company, truly working to make people's lives better.

Pros: The benefits are really great

Cons: Too narrow on the next stage outside Apple.
Advice: None
Pros: People and culture very down to earth. Treasure human resources as precious assets as well. Appreciate that!

Cons: Ableist culture Inclusion and diversity is for optics only - in practice - tons of discrimination thinly veiled as “opportunities to work on” instead of any tangible feedback. They hold back high performers and champion mediocrity over all else.
Advice: Maybe don’t goad people you have no intention of promoting. Fake happiness helps no one. Toxic positivity has to stop. 4 day work week for actual work/life balance - other companies are doing it, you can too. Unionizing it the only way to move forward as a company. Get on board.

Cons: Terrible development for retail employees Gaslighting courtesy of Area managers No clear path to corporate Dwindling number of employees that results in double the work Killing the Creative Role and giving engaging sessions to Creative Pros only
Advice: If you take care of your employees, they will take care of your customers. Pizza parties are not nearly as good as quality of life improvements and better work/life balance

Cons: They are the kings of making you feel as though you are being taken care of and working at the best job in the world, but they don't actually care about you. I was injured and should have been able to take short term paid disability leave and the managers knew it, but let me stay on the job in pain with "accommodations," conveniently forgetting to let me know I qualified for leave. It wasn't until a full year later I found out. Also, they say metrics don't matter... but metrics matter.

Cons: Getting one bad manager can ruin entire experience.
Advice: None
Pros: I’ve worked at many Apple stores and most are great.

Advice: Please increase pay. I can work at a job with less qualifications and get paid more with less stress. A MIT at Mcdonalds gets paid more. It's like the support staff are the red headed step children and we don't get paid fair. A starting hourly rate should be AT LEAST $22 per hour and not $18. Apple Care employee are what keeps customers happy when things go wrong and with the surveys we have to maintain good customer service.

Cons: Something is broken but the related department seems superior. So the broken system can not be corrected, which really hurts.
Advice: Pay attention to some superior department, what they have done is awful, makes no sense, and hurts Apple and its employees a lot.
Pros: great engineering environment, you could use your knowledge to improve millions of people's lives

Cons: Retail schedule, limited advancement, retail role
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible schedule, fast paced, stock options

Cons: Its isn't safe , especially not for women or people of color No one really cares to help people, they just say that to get hired No one is happy to be there and that eventually rubs off on even the most positive people I made less money here than in any job I have ever had People were competitive, or just gross and creepy. It was impossible for me to make a real friend.
Advice: Hiring only white queer managers doesn't count as being inclusive and neither does hiring people of color in the fall just to let them all go by spring after the inclusion and diversity reports have been conducted.
Pros: No one cares, so you can truly do whatever you want and almost never get fired (unless you report someone for harassment, then you'll get pushed out) Depending on the leadership, it might be a nice experience or it might be complete chaos, which is fun All the geniuses complained constantly about not enough hours, pay, compensation or room to grow.

Cons: - I worked in the Genius Bar part of the store and nothing the technicians did was appreciated unless they were able to get the customer to trade in and upgrade or attach AppleCare to a device under limited warranty. Technicians were expected to be able resolve software and hardware solutions for devices AND be able to pitch a sale all while being paid the same or LESS than some people who only did sales. - My specific role as Genius Admin was never appreciated. The role kept things in the repair room running smoothly, dealing with customer service issues, informing customers of the progress of their repairs and letting them know when it was ready for pickup and also bringing these devices back to the customer when they came in store to pick it up. It’s a role that requires more than one person throughout the day but whenever more than one was scheduled we’d get pulled from our actual job to do technical support out on the floor (since my store was smaller we only had three. Two fulltime and one part time who could only work nights), which made work pile up on one admin and was very stressful all around. - Management has no idea what anybody does unless they started from the ground up and even then they’d never stay up to date with the changes to be more of a support to employees. - The business promotes work life balance and tries to convince you you have it, but in reality you don’t. Part timers aren’t allowed off on the weekends (unless requested a whole month in advance) and full timers can’t have a weekend day off tied into a weekday (like a Friday/Saturday or Sunday/Monday). Staying past your scheduled time was always praised instead of ACTUAL good work. Constantly being told they need to cut hours but always being asked to stay late. Understaffed and overworked. - Little to no growth opportunities unless you want to uproot your entire life to another city/state. Trying to move from retail to corporate is next to impossible and they always state there are plenty of work from home opportunities but they outsource a lot of it to third party companies and don’t ever have openings. And if they do they usually reject retail employees resumes.
Advice: LEARN YOUR EMPLOYEES ROLES!!! If you’re a manager of the Genius Bar you should be able to help an Admin that needs support. It’s insane how little y’all know about what your employees do. Actually listen to your employees and what they’re telling you. They are the backbone of the store. Whether it’s Genius Bar, Product Zone, Backstage or Business. We see the little things day to day. If your employees are saying they’re unhappy with how their area of the store is being ran and it’s not helping the customers or the employees.
Pros: - The benefits at Apple truly are amazing. The family leave to take care of sick family members was a blessing. As well as being able to take a mental health leave of 3 months after something tragic happened in my life. - Working at a smaller store made everyone i worked with like a member of my family. We didn’t have weird friend cliques and continued to uplift each other. - The pay is significantly better than all other retail locations.

Cons: Enough isn't like they said. Fast pacing retail store, always busy, but they always take care of you as a human being in all aspects.
Advice: They have been doing way better during the last two years, listening more and demonstrating more empathy with employees.
Pros: A place where you can be a real human being; they empathize with you, and you live in a human way that I never felt before.

Cons: People that come in can sometimes be mean
Advice: Keep doing great
Pros: Good hours Good people Good energy they want you to succeed

Cons: Very structures, mean managers, tons of older set in store folk
Advice: Hire more people who love the company and not so much who just love tech.
Pros: Flexibility, fun, challenging, lucrative, prestigious

Cons: This solely depends on role, HWTE is like the bottom pool. A lot of overnight works. Constantly monitor stuff, and if management is not good it becomes a nightmere. But I know people with better management as well
Advice: No
Pros: Really good compensation, stock and benefits

Cons: Too many customers at a time.
Advice: Apple should not let customers make appointments. Only via phone call to Apple Support. Then the representatives have to be properly trained so they can properly vet each person. Then give us more time with customer issues and follow the fire safety limit for the building.

Pros: good pay/bonus cool co workers good benefits

Cons: I may come back to edit this review later to be more in-depth but for now I just wanted to mention the above. One sort of con is that the company and therefore the managers use very indirect/abnormal language sometimes. Ie talking about "opportunies" instead of areas of improvement or performance reviews essentially being a script based around a company principle instead of being more direct from the manager themselves. There's no real issue with it - it works for them - it's just more of a personal preference how sometimes important communication about growth feels fake/scripted. I haven't been here for very long but from what I've seen so far there are some things I don't agree with in the process of getting promotions. In some cases the obvious choice for a promotion is the person who gets hired, but in some others they've passed over someone more deserving for someone who seems to be more of a favorite. Or there was one case where someone was passed over for a promotion that they absolutely deserved because they were so insanely efficient in their current role, it would probably have cost the company time and money to promote them.
Advice: None
Pros: Apple is always talking about how their soul is their people but they really do put their money where their mouth is. Two days ago we started to get air quality warnings in our area due to the Canadian wild fires. I think they immediately took action because just today they had a company bring in two industrial air filters - one for the front of the store and one for the back. Our store doesn't face the street - we're inside a mall so we can't really tell the difference inside, but I was blown away by how they went out of their way to ensure ours and our customers' safety anyways.

Advice: When it's busy in the store, to actually help out instead of just staring at the busy store. It gets tiring just expecting the sales specialists (which are lightly scheduled) to take ALL the people on the sales floor one after the other before feeling burnt out. You were once sales specialists too. Give some support to the team for once.

If you’re full time you can either choose (one) set day off, or preferred shifts and preferred day off, which is not guaranteed. so expect indefinite inconsistency with days off and getting scheduled different shifts every day/ week. Culture is blanketed as diverse but is in reality very biased and employees are expected to fit a specific mold in order to advance. They hire and promote based off racial and gender trends.

Cons: Social game. It’s all about how into the brand you are and if you have a “story”. Once they feel like you are not as into it as they’d like you to be they start to micro manage, then put you on a disciplinary coaching and then fire you. It’s obvious. They pick the social outcasts and give them a sense of community where they all have one thing in common “Apple”. There’s no diversity in the company. Look at the chairmen of the company…it’s a bunch of older Caucasian people and their idea of diversity in a company. ..which is why the product sales are tanking. The company also only hires and promotes internally based on political trend… and make you sign a NDA. Yikes I hope this is anonymous 🫣
Advice: You have great talent that comes to you. Use it.
Pros: The pay and the benefits

Cons: You get burnt out because you are always talking to demanding customers. Part-time workers get treated just like full-time. Sometimes they get better zoning (Like they are scheduled in the back more) which doesn't make sense to me.
Advice: Listen to the employees better when they are stating they need time off the floor.
Pros: Amazing benefits. Part-time and Full-time options. The managers do try their hardest to care for you as a person and support you as needed.

Cons: Very busy and hectic. It’s retail plus repairs so you’ll get some not so happy customers but managers will have your back.
Advice: None
Pros: Great work culture and amazing benefits.

Cons: you will miss the people you work with if you choose to leave
Advice: None
Pros: - amazing people - great work ethic - caring higher-ups

Advice: may want to show some attrition
Pros: espp program is a great motivator

Cons: - Multi tasking - Co workers can be annoying
Advice: None
Pros: - Great Place to work, good scheduling

Cons: No room to grow at all. If you come in as a T1, you can transition to T2 quickly but expect to be in the T2 role for a long time and all of the moves from T2 sometimes are considered as lateral moves and people have more responsibilities but the pay don’t change unless you are in management or a engineer.
Advice: Recognize your people who have been there in the same roles for over 5 years. After doing a role repeatedly over they lose the momentum and desire of the role. It stops feeling like a passion and more like a job. We come to apple to make changes in people lives. We are the first people our customers see and talk too. We mentor our customers and love them but we need growth too.
Pros: Get benefits and perks. This review isn’t based off contract work. This is a direct hire with over 5 years.

Cons: Working on the weekend and holiday
Advice: None
Pros: Very flexible and will let you take time off

Cons: Apple has shifted away from in-depth repairs on-premises. While this is arguably more efficient, it is not a benefit to its patrons.
Advice: None
Pros: They take care of their people.

Cons: The environment was totally satisfied.
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing Atmosphere with learning and growth.

Cons: Repetitive work Negative energy from angry customers Typical call center metrics 10 hour shifts
Advice: None

Cons: lack of communication between managers for development plans.
Advice: None
Pros: people, customer relationships, managers are great as well!

Cons: I was excited to work for apple but the culture definitely shifted back when Angela took her position. Funny thing I got to meet her literally my first shift after getting hired. I was in training when they announced getting rid of the well known blue apple shirts and the lanyards so I feel I missed out on that original apple culture and watched their value in community diminish.
Advice: Fight upper management to bring back the services that matter. I know there are a lot of people up top but when enough people speak up, they tend to listen.
Pros: I learned so much about customer service even skills that I still use today.

Cons: long hours, lots of work, and flexibility
Advice: None
Pros: flexible, competitive pay, good experience, and good job oppurtunities

Advice: By being so nice while working
Pros: Its nice to work at applw

Cons: - Work-life balance - Pressure
Advice: None
Pros: - Salary - Mind blowing benefits - Career opportunities - Educational opportunities

Cons: Unrealistic goals and expectations. Freezing your career growth if you don’t measure up to constantly evolving demands. Lots of promoting via popularity contest within retail environment.
Advice: Can’t provide advice to management. The executive level are so insulated by wealth and fame they don’t care what we think. What matters is what they want.
Pros: Pay. Benefits. People. Tech. Challenge.

Cons: its busy with limit staff, iphones sell like hot cakes
Advice: nothing at the moment
Pros: good culture, everyone looks out for eachother

Cons: Management micromanages in every store I've worked in. You don't have flexibility in your schedule. The pay is not great for what you deal with especially with how well the company is doing. There should be better discounts and higher pay.
Advice: None
Pros: great stock options and benefits package. Lots of resources and programs. Great insurance

Cons: Some tech bros thought it was very intense and made things inefficient
Advice: None
Pros: Loved the cool products, team motivation, and the remote work style (though we're in person now) .

Cons: Management, merit increases are extremely underwhelming, they often tend to nudge out more tenured employees to get someone new and ignorant to the issues going on internally
Advice: None
Pros: Pay, hours, amount of work, working environment

Cons: Time spent at work on- and off-hours will consume most of a persons energy. The secrecy that is part of delivering the delightful introduction of a product is part of daily life at Apple, this creates barriers and is a huge stressor.
Advice: Leader Circle ® style of management recommended
Pros: Best Products from a consumer perspective, every aspect of the experience from unboxing through the decision to replace a product with a newly developed version of the same is carefully crafted. The support systems are as well very carefully crafted.

Cons: Schedule is made out at least 3-4 weeks in advance so unless you’re a planner then making last minute plans or something coming up is a little harder. Transferring to different stores is also harder, you don’t get the opportunity to just transfer, you have to interview and see if you potentially get hired at a different store despite having a good report.
Advice: None
Pros: The jobs offers some of the hands down best benefits a job can offer. I love the structure for feedback and how there is much room for improvement and time allotted for that. The 401k match is great, the time off points are great, and the overall environment is one to experience.

Cons: -Really poor growth -Less visibility
Advice: None
Pros: Good product to work on

Cons: sometimes may be more stressful
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Employee Incentives are very competitive.

Cons: Could be stressful at times
Advice: None
Pros: Innovative research/development of user centric features

Cons: Customers can be nuts...they care about their devices so passionately that when they don't work they are often angry, entitled and abusive.
Advice: Keep it up!
Pros: The training is intensive, you feel very prepared when you get to the sales floor. The steps of service are something you'll use daily in all areas of life and will use no matter where you go next. The management works to develop you and there is scheduled times throughout the year to touch base and work on that development. If you are mobile, your options within the company are endless! Great place for a young person to work...take the training, the development, the tuition assistance, the stocks, the insurance, etc and make the most of it!

Cons: The day to day is very stressful and the company expects you to go above and beyond without getting any additional compensation.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits (discounts, healthcare, stock)

Cons: Since I was on a seasonal contract, I wish that they were given more room to expand and keep seasonal workers longer. In most cases they can, but due to how the economy is like right now, it is something they have to do with the company. Other than letting seasonals go, they have a really good system on how to support employees on and off the sales floor.
Advice: None
Pros: Apple has shown great care and support to all employees. The company cares so much about their employees to ensure that they are in a comfortable workspace and given opportunities to grow in the company. I've learned so much, training was more about what the company was about and what it stands for. I learn about the products and services a few days after the main training days. Employment and interview process is very intricate to ensure that the best hard workers would be given the chance to share their knowledge on the sales floor while also continuing to learn and grow from every interaction.

Cons: I didn't feel that the employee review system was as impactful as it could have been - Perhaps too many employees, and too little time to assess properly.
Advice: None
Pros: The benefits are fantastic &amp; full of professional development opportunities.

Cons: The work is stressful and there is a lot of overtime.
Advice: None
Pros: Good working environment and plenty of room for advancement.

Cons: Apple likes to retaliate hard for unionizing, and will send higher up employees to try to dispel and discourage such activity, and it continues even if/after your store unionizes. Also didn’t have many opportunities to grow within my store just with corporate and payroll issues.
Advice: None
Pros: A wonderful environment and very tight knit. Was the first time a company used the phrase “we’re a family” and I felt it to be true in the realest sense it could. Great pay and benefits, never a dull day.

Cons: Not enough work life balance in my opinion. Can't pick your own schedule unless you met the metrics. Long hours and have to take calls back to back Didn't enjoy the job at all. Many entitled and rude customers Not a lot of room to grow
Advice: None
Pros: There was a lot of benefits: stocks, PTO, Sick time off, maternity leave...

Cons: Culture to focused, may need more development.
Advice: None
Pros: Very good environment at the location

Advice: None
Pros: Great atmosphere and people. Good work hours

Cons: You will have mean customers. Culture is very "drink the kool-aid". You'll hear you're changing the world when you're really just fixing someones phone.
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, fun workplace and mostly good management

Cons: Honestly, none that I can think of so far. The hours can be long, but it depends where you're at in your life. I don't have any personal obligations right now, so it's really easy for me to stay plugged in since I'm passionate about the product and mission, but I can empathize with those that might be at a different place in their life.
Advice: Keep on keepin' on
Pros: Everyone has a lot of motivation, and brings energy to the discussion. People are passionate about their work. Managers and directors are technically proficient and quite personable. Each day poses new, difficult challenges which is always really exciting. The inclusion and diversity is so refreshing, too. The facilities are amazing, and it's easy to accomplish work/tasks from anywhere. You have all of the tools and information available to you to execute your job. The cafes are also really great, and there are a ton of perks. I could go on and on about how much I enjoy my job.

Cons: Very metrics focus Bad leadership Shady practices
Advice: Do better get back to basics and not focus on your bonus
Pros: Fun and can be easy

Cons: Micromanaging, gaslighting, lack of work-life balance, discriminatory practices with employees and promotions, lack of interest from leadership to acknowledge and change racist business practices.

Cons: None that come to mind
Advice: None
Pros: Pay, team around me, hours

Cons: Benefits were not super great
Advice: None
Pros: Good talent, I learned a lot

Cons: I do suspect that males were getting paid better walking in the door, however I believe it balanced out with bonuses and raises IF you were an 'above and beyond' female employee. If you did your job right and were there without a future plan to stay, males seemed to be paid more than females. Also, do not recommend if sales is cringe-y to you. I got through it but it very much is a sales based job and some people don't believe it until they are there.
Advice: Keep listening to your staff and helping where it's needed. The passion shows!
Pros: The culture of Apple is great, especially at the Brea location. There was an emphasis on being open with co workers and pushing each other to be better. Many of the managers are also great and there to listen to their staff while also stepping in when needed to help during busy times.

Cons: Really no protected weekends off. Taking vacation requires a request 1-2 months in advance. Low pay
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, stock plan and discount

Cons: They do not promote from within, so for growth there is always consistent moving and changing locations, or just waiting till there is no one else better suited, even if you were the best suited in the beginning.
Advice: Learn to see the people who are working within the store rather than prioritizing stories you are hearing from other stores.
Pros: It was a great learning experience for soft skills and being able to take advantage of all the benefits they had to offer

Cons: One downside I experienced was that despite requesting time off well in advance, even three weeks beforehand, my time off was canceled multiple times.
Advice: None
Pros: This store has great leaders who create a positive and inclusive atmosphere for employees. They really care about helping employees grow by providing training programs, workshops, and mentorship opportunities.

Cons: Full time employment almost never opportunities almost never come Hours suck. Stores are operated like a cult. Your success in the company is based purely on how well you can brown nose.

Advice: Maybe don't be so weird about how great Apple is. They're selling tech not eternal life.
Pros: Good people - very down to earth. It was a chill environment. Once, a blizzard was due to hit us and I requested to leave. Most people were staying (it's the north east so people have no issue traveling in the snow) but I was worried I'd get snowed in. They let me leave.

Advice: None
Pros: Strong and capable coworkers, remote work is good

Cons: None the job was amazing
Advice: Great management
Pros: Amazing job, fun energetic love it

Cons: No salary pay (entry level roles) or annual bonuses, if worked at genius bar as a technical expert RARE to get small bonus. Interview is always an annoying slow process (convenient for managers schedule, abrupt communication to the employees when it comes to 'phased' interviews). The team dynamic with managers varies per store however, there is no clear cut answer to a specific circumstantial concern (can get a bit annoying) anyone will tell you their opinion differently which can get in the way in your overall day to day performance. My store was new so there was a lot of managerial employees, new to their role, learning as they go but as someone lower status they may recommend something that you may disagree with. Feedback is really big at Apple but if the store doesn't feel comfortable giving feedback, it can lead to toxic work environment. (Flagship stores are drastically different for this very reason, more people,more flexibility,etc) Work life balance is non existent, Apple is always "ever changing" so they currently outsource the scheduling team. It can get quite annoying stressing your needs whether its PTO or overall experience. Only way I can describe working t a store is like small but VERY major on following corporate protocols which isn't the best in your own personal milestones. It does bring structure to the company but it can get in the way when it comes to moving up in the company for example. My particular store has a lot of theft, feeling pressured to constantly look at merchandise when it isn't my job felt inappropriate when we have security guards. It goes again to show you how money is a major stress, even up selling customer for accessories is very much encouraged (never forced), it's hard for me to recommend a product such as Apple's phone cases, when they crack/peel off almost immediately. Doing things that made sense to me for ex: not up selling, not guarding merchandise, I am a very self conscious person and I feel like I most definitely would not get the acknowledgment I needed that I was doing what is right, the numbers is all that matters and I am a regular nice person at the company in the sea of cool people, ya kno? As an employee, you look up to your leaders and I do not appreciate when we had important store visitors they behaved extra nicely and some even encouraged the team to be on their best behavior which I found to be inappropriate. Overall, the job opportunities depend on the economic season as well as Apple's business demands which come in different seasons or months, it can get bad when you need that advancement in your career but there are no openings for what you are going for (It is encouraged you continue to learn in your role). I felt mixed emotions at my particular store wanting two roles with different competencies because in leadership it has a very high potential to get looked down upon as if you don't know what you want to do in your professional career at Apple. It is not discouraged nor encouraged which I found to be more in the grey area.
Advice: None
Pros: People you work with in company's culture is so unique, you would definitely make a tight circle of a network (family vibes). Apple has definitely shifted to a more consumer focus,number focus, culture; as we went through a recession we didn't lose any employees/hours which is a plus, however, seasonal kiddos got kicked because our store was not making enough money. The pay is really good compared to most retail stores (the best you could go for in my opinion but could be better honestly). Apple has a way to increase pay slightly enough to retain their employees because the overall job market does not pay as such, very rare to be starting at the amount Apple gives you. It varies per state but they know where that salary sweet spot is, where it's not to high or low of a benchmark. The benefits team at Apple is really really great at what they do. The health, the stocks, the Apple discounts, the volunteer events, we also get 3 days out of the year paid time off, therapy sessions, transportation passes and probably more hidden gems but those are just the main few. Apple has amazing benefits and a network of resources that most companies do not have. I know now Coursera is new avenue their offering for people who want get certifications in specific courses. There is a lot and Apple is always updating their benefits deals, only time can tell what else, overall really good benefits. One major pro is the surveys every store conducts every year to see how employees feel, great way get connected and align with the team. There is also an employee engagement team that conducts cute employee events that can happen during holidays or any week. The overall experience is very homey, rare thing to feel in workplace I do not take for granted. Even people who work in different stores or different departments outside of the store, very welcoming, very interpersonal, great people for sure. I even had a funny moment after working in company with customer service, they were all really helpful in my situation. I love the people.

Pros: Benefits, good starting pay, open to feedback, and potential for growth

Cons: Customers ranged from civilized to crotchety. If met with the latter, you could potentially be working with a customer for an alarming amount of time. Be prepared to be verbally assaulted by customers.
Advice: I hope that management can be more clear about the hiring process timeline. From application to acceptance call, the time period was too stretched out for a retail position (3 months to be exact). I found following up was the best way to communicate, but I noticed that receiving hiring process updates constantly went beyond the stated waiting time.
Pros: Leadership continually fostered a place to freely share ideas, advocate for yourself and colleagues, as well as provide tools to better serve the retail store experience. Time management was heavily encouraged for well being, and the team supported one another when needed to meet those requirements.

Pros: I worked with a lot of great people at Apple.

Pros: People cool to work with

Cons: 13 years and no "Apple Car" now with a major leak .. This tells you the utter incompetence that plagues Apple. The company thinks it's cooler than it really is and hasn't innovated in over a decade.
Advice: Fire everybody that Tim Cook has brought on since 2012 .. find suitable replacements that can innovate.. Then fire Tim.. His mundane management and no frills corporate bloat have made Apple the boring ho - hum company Steve Jobs thoroughly hated.

Pros: Good managers good people good pay

Cons: Certain stores have a harder time with internal growth than others. After I left the company (not no bad terms), I still had friends who worked for apple who were looking to progress and work up the ladder. After I recommended leaving that particular store (Apple Fifth Ave) and transferring to another location, their career development was immediate. Be mindful for environments that speak about professional development and growth but do act on the practice. This happened with multiple people. However this is my only con, everything else about the company is great.
Advice: None
Pros: We didn't have sales quotas. The job was solely educating customers on products and providing great customer service. Great for those with no tech experience, apple will do all the internal work to train you. What they look for are people who are passionate and go above and beyond with customer service. Being a people's person!

Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, great for personal development up to a certain extent, great for tech.

Cons: Depending on where you are, it can be hard to generate upward movement. From the retail side if you work in a store where there are not any other Apple Retail locations nearby, i.e within 100 miles, the ladder of the store can stagnate.
Advice: None
Pros: There is never a dull moment, if you want a job where you always have something to do and encounter every type of person out there, Apple Retail is a great fit.

EPP stocks, discounts on products Great work environment and culture Pay raise after performance review Opportunity of growth within the division or transferring out to another department Rotational opportunities for position that might open in the future

Cons: High stress, fast paced, conflict resolution.
Advice: Empower more employees to diversify their skills
Pros: Communication from the top down, and feedback welcome to and from everyone.

Cons: No bonus or incentive structure whatsoever; managers literally bonus from your work. Management is based on cronyism and they do NOT care about their employees whatever. Expect to be doing multiple jobs at once, all the time. Extremely hostile to unions, and constantly untruthful regarding this. Very unreceptive to the concerns of black employees.
Advice: If your soul is your people, as you say - treat them as such. There is no reason people should be needing second jobs and struggling to pay rent when this company made more than $2,000,000 PER employee last year. Corporate lives a totally distinct experience to retail.
Pros: Benefits, especially for full time can be quite useful. .

Cons: Can’t exactly think of one
Advice: None
Pros: Love the management and leadership at Apple

Advice: None
Pros: The culture and the people that work there are amazing. Some of the most kind and personable people I have ever met

Cons: Long work hours. Insane customers who are entitled They raise entry level pay without adjusting higher level pay, during my tenure at the end I was there for 3 months shy of 10 years, I was a senior advisor and before the raise was making 8$ over base pay which was fair but then the increase to base but senior employees ended up making 1.75$ over base

Cons: Terrible management that over promises and fails to deliver constantly. Management lacks ability to take responsibility or follow up effectively on concerns expressed by employees. Company brainwashes the “core value” of inclusivity but disrespect Spanish speaking employees by not compensating for requiring use of a second language. Leadership gas lights employees by claiming they’re “addressing” concerns that have years of being raised. Leadership is non existent, tasks are delegated without guided support or follow ups.

Pros: Great benefits like stock options and health insurance plans.

Cons: Cult Like Mentality Harassment for choice of personal non apple products.

Managers insisted that the job includes letting people touch you.
Advice: Protect Your Employees.

Advice: None
Pros: diverse, fun, and innovative, training is nice

Cons: They have roles where the job duties outside the company would be compensated much more. However, because they do not refer to that role in the same way they do outside the company, they can get away with putting people in those positions who may not be qualified for the role and pay them lower than average salary.

Cons: Too many customers for comfort.
Advice: None
Pros: People are fun at Apple.

Cons: The retail stores are not managed consistently. Some markets have great reviews, and employees love working there. Others are trying to unionize. The market I worked in was very toxic, and they did not treat employees fairly.
Advice: Treat your employees how you would want to be treated. Don't target individuals that you don't like or are easy to coach out, focus on having the best team as a whole.

Advice: None
Pros: I really liked working here

Cons: Cannot share information about Apple
Advice: Can be more respectful
Pros: Good pay and good hours

Cons: Very very busy most of the time. There weren't many days where we could just 'stand around'. The manager culture is absolutely horrible. They reward based on 'attitude' over skill. The feedback culture is completely corrupted, using extremely broad competencies to justify promotions for their favorite employees over skilled employees.
Advice: Hiring based on favorites leaves the team struggling.
Pros: Amazing pay. I went from making around $9/hr with Best Buy to $15/hr with Apple. Doing pretty much the same thing. (I ended my tenure at $20/hr) Prior to this I worked at Hollister, Target, Verizon, and Best Buy. This is, by far, the best retail experience you can have. Education reimbursement is what allowed me to leave retail altogether.

Pros: Amazing benefits and a great environment.

Cons: Customer service can be tiring
Advice: None
Pros: For the most part, they give you all the equipment you need

Cons: - Extremely high-stress environment - Full-time employment will suck the life out of you. Everything is a rush and you are not praised for taking your time with customers to give a great experience. - Management does not truly care about its employees (as much as they pretend to) and I have worked at more than one location. - Customers' happiness is put before any bad treatment of employees by the customers - Easiest time to change roles in the retail stores is in the beginning, after that...there's a lot of politics involved. - Management knows who they want in certain positions and will do their best to keep others out of certain roles. - Reporting management goes nowhere no matter how many higher ups you speak with. Nothing came of the any mistreatment reports I put in. I witnessed countless employees do the same and management never got penalized.
Advice: - Value employees as you do the customers - I get that you care about your job, but you should care about the mental well-being of your employees - Communication about in-store operational strategies needs to be better...when I worked in store...managers and leads were never on the same page because managers only wanted to talk to managers - Keep employee private information PRIVATE and confidential instead of spreading information to everyone
Pros: - Part-time employment is great and can be flexible. - Benefits are some of the best I've ever had at a company (medical, mental health, fitness, tuition reimbursement, etc.) - Job security is definitely there. - Strict processes are in place to handle poor performance. You will not just "get fired" unless you are truly doing something wrong or inappropriate. - Growth within the company and ability to change roles. - Constantly learning new information about products and software.

Cons: There is nothing to complain about.

Cons: Tough hours, challenging tool set
Advice: None
Pros: Great technology and cool culture

Cons: Product launches and software issues can be extremely stressful. Due to the size of the company, very difficult to move departments or move up in position.
Advice: Lay out expectations/examples for moving out of an entry level position and how an employee would go about doing that. Most managers don't have good answers.
Pros: AHA support was 24/7 so we often had the ability to change our schedules and/or work a lot of overtime. Good incentives for overtime hours and general participation. Productive one-on-one meetings. Pretty good pay for entry level position.

Cons: I rarely got to see my coworkers since most of them tried working remotely as much as possible Most my coworkers cared more about the "prestige" of working at Apple rather than the product we were working on. Was sad to see really. The final intern presentation is made to be a big deal but in reality, it is a 15-minute slide show with higher-ups who don't even pretend to be interested
Advice: None
Pros: Get to be on the cutting edge of VLSI design and verification Competitive pay Good intern events

Cons: A bit of a secretive culture. Not always easy to see where you stand with management.
Advice: Make the culture more open, feedback friendly.
Pros: Team that works closely together. Environment is nice and food is good at the office.

Cons: I was told Applecare is a well find oil machine and it’s not going to change. There is no career growth there and there is no financial growth there. I also heard in other meetings people saying if you want to be treated like an adult you work here if you don’t want to be treated like an adult you go work at Apple care support. Upper management doesn’t listen to your concerns. Our pay increases don’t match the cost of living or the value of our positions. We take stressful calls all day long. And by the end of the day your mental health is worn out. This is the main reason why people quit if they’re willing to say it out loud or write it like I am right now. If you need good health care this is the job for you but it’s stressful. Your schedules are based on your metrics and if customers give you one bad review it knocks you out a line. And you have to take more and more calls to get your metrics up. So that means you’re wearing out your mental health at the same time. We often submit suggestions and ideas to upper management and for years that I have been there they have never been listened to by anyone. One of the things that was disappointing by my management was they were going to give us a reward system and then if they were going to give us stickers as a way of showing how we improved. We work for Apple and you’re going to give me a sticker for my improvement? And you never know what type of manager you’re going to get.
Advice: None, do you only say thank you for letting us know and then they do nothing.
Pros: Good health insurance and coworkers.

Cons: Store leadership, but this has since been rectified
Advice: Be more flexible with your employees. Again- this has been rectified
Pros: Apple is one of the best places that I have worked at over the last 10 years. I worked as a technical specialist troubleshooting people's personal devices. The only reason I didn't stay is because I could not commit to working more hours as requested by the former store leader.

Cons: Unlimited time with my kidsz

Cons: It’s retail and people love their phones and when they break they take it out on you.

Pros: I worked for Apple for 6 years and while people give them a lot of crap, you aren’t going to find a retail job that treats part timers (full medical, dental, vision) the way they do.

Intense work culture: Apple is known for having a fast-paced and intense work culture, with long hours and tight deadlines. This can make it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Limited creativity: While Apple encourages innovation, the company also has a highly structured design process that may limit creative freedom for some employees. Competitive environment: Apple is a highly competitive company, and employees may feel pressure to constantly perform at their best and outdo their peers. Limited autonomy: Apple is a highly centralized company, and decisions are often made at the highest levels of management. This can limit the autonomy and decision-making power of individual employees. Limited diversity in leadership: While Apple values diversity, there has been criticism of the company's lack of diversity in its upper management and leadership positions. Long hours: Apple employees often work long hours, especially during product launches and other busy periods. This can lead to burnout and stress.
Advice: None
Pros: Innovation: Apple is known for being at the forefront of technology innovation, and working for a company that is always pushing the boundaries can be exciting and fulfilling. Strong brand: Apple is a highly respected brand that is recognized globally. Working for such a well-known and reputable company can enhance your professional profile and open up future career opportunities. Competitive compensation: Apple offers its employees competitive salaries and comprehensive benefits packages, including health, dental, and vision insurance, retirement plans, and employee discounts on Apple products. Opportunities for growth: Apple is a large company with a variety of departments and roles, providing many opportunities for professional growth and advancement. Inclusivity and diversity: Apple values inclusivity and diversity, and is committed to creating a welcoming and supportive workplace for all employees, regardless of their background or identity. Company culture: Apple has a unique and inspiring company culture, centered around creativity, collaboration, and innovation.

Cons: Some potential cons of working at Apple include a competitive and fast-paced work environment, which can be stressful for some employees. Additionally, there may be a high expectation for secrecy and confidentiality, which can make it difficult to share information or collaborate with others outside the company. Some former employees also reported feeling micromanaged or having limited autonomy in their work. Additionally, some employees may find the company culture to be exclusive or insular, and may not feel that they fit in with the company's values and way of working.
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Flexible and great training, prepares for mostly what you'll encounter in daily responsibilities

Cons: 1. High-pressure work environment: This does not apply to all roles and areas but in some more than others the demand is very high and sometimes that pressure is not sustainable. 2. Lack of work-life balance: Apple is good about encouraging this but again this only applies to specific teams where there is less of that and others have more of this dependent by role. When I worked here I had this a good amount but just pointing this out. 3. Highly competitive culture: This could be a Pro for some and others a Con. Many times people want to grow and stay with Apple which is great but the competition for advancement can be extremely daunting at times. 4. Limited opportunities for creativity: Again, dependent on role. There can be a stagnation in the exploration of creativity when there are specific metrics that are driving specific outcomes.
Advice: Improve work-life balance: While Apple's high-pressure workplace is a major contributor to its achievement, it's critical to place a priority on employee wellbeing and prevent burnout. More flexible work schedules, vacation incentives, and the provision of mental health resources could all be helpful in this area. Encourage a collaborative and team-oriented environment: While healthy rivalry is possible, it's crucial to prevent Apple's culture from becoming ruthless or excessively centered on individual success. Partnership and participation are encouraged as a way to build a sense of community among staff members.
Pros: 1. Competitive benefits: benefits package, which includes health insurance, retirement benefits, and generous stock options. Other benefits through third-party promotions, discounts, and incentives vary depending on the season. 2. Innovative and inspiring work culture: There is high praise for Apple's culture of innovation and creativity which does not stop in the credo but continues in their work environment. Since Apple is selective about who they hire you to tend to really enjoy working with similar but diverse groups of people who are passionate about what they do. 3. Opportunities for career growth: This can be looking at a lateral move to another team, a higher role, or working outside your role with a career opportunity for a time period to gain experience in that area. All great things whether you are working in retail or corporate. 4. Engaging in new technology: This is a given working at Apple that you are surrounded by new technology and that is encouraged to foster that sense of continuity of learning.

Pros: was good experience for me

Cons: The culture was incredibly toxic and suffocating. The lack of diversity was very problematic, there were no women or POC (tech minorities) anywhere up my entire manager chain all the up to Tim Cook. People I worked with were often rude, impatient, and biased towards underrepresented minorities in tech. Management was unhelpful, often gaslighting complaints. HR is nowhere to be seen. The perks were not worth the trauma.
Advice: Educate yourself into the pitfalls of "inclusion and diversity" efforts. Pay more attention to your team's culture, and work to foster a warm and inclusive environment before a productive one. With the former, the latter will come. With only the latter, work is just miserable even if productive.

Cons: Apple's culture of secrecy has been exploited by many managers with ulterior motives. They are usually people who have worked at Apple for a long time, but somehow feel deeply insecure and need to defend their turf/vested interest in Apple. They exclude new people from important team tasks, they don't give team members any exposure, they only use you for a small part of the project and don't let you participate the whole process - as if more capable people join, they lose the limelight . Worst of all, some managers go out of their way to belittle the efforts and strengths of others, they claim credit for others' work. They tend to hire someone with 10 + years of experience to do an intern job, which they feel is normal at Apple as they boast that they only hire the best talent in the market. Some managers are living against the company culture of Diversity and Inclusion. There are many contractors and temporary employees working for the company and are NOT well-treated, often, in a unspoken and hidden way.
Advice: Any behaviors that exploit the well-intentioned company culture should be noticed. If Apple has the wisdom to develop such sophisticated company systems, it should be able to go further train its managers and review their leadership and behaviors regularly. If the company does not create a sense of belong for new comers and just let those long-time employees exclude or belittle others through hidden ways, the reputation of the company is a worry in long run.
Pros: Great Benefits - health account, education account, discounted company stocks and products. Well-developed company systems protect employees from being easily fired based on a manager's personal preferences Company wide activities and resources make me feel they really care about employees’ well being.

Cons: - eventually can burn out if you lose focus
Advice: None
Pros: - great people - great benefits - flexible preferences - culture is on point

Cons: Some time gets too hectic
Advice: None

Cons: Can't afford to live where you work.
Advice: ...
Pros: Great team that is supportive.

Cons: management was not the best tbh.
Advice: None
Pros: fun environment, cool people, tough customers, management is okay

Cons: Retail is Retail. Having to deal with rich snobby customers gets really tiring really fast. Having to deal with managers pestering you about your numbers that don't reflect your work ethic is frustrating. Be weary that some locations participate in some predatory salesmen behavior just to get their numbers up. This can conflict with work performance if you're a decent human being.
Advice: Stop putting emphasis on numbers, you lose good quality people that way. Put employees first before customers. Retail is the backbone of the company and are treated with disrespect.
Pros: Pretty good discounts, decent pay, good overall benefits. Gives you a start in a big company, easy to move up.

Cons: You are dealing with the public. I dealt equally with amazing people and amazingly crazy people.
Advice: Never forget that some customers are abusive. Never normalize taking abuse from customers as an acceptable cost of doing the job. Stand behind your technicians always, while helping them improve at dealing with challenging situations.
Pros: Learn troubleshooting hardware and software in a way you can use anywhere going forward. Learn to manage all kinds of personalities effectively and better ways to form genuinely meaningful working relationships with colleagues and customers alike.

Cons: Sometimes managers are not chosen based on their ability to lead people.
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay, benefits, prestige, and smart people all around

Cons: The values and principles laid out in the credo are often disregarded at our store, except when it comes to achieving specific goals such as trade-ins and iPhone activations. The work environment is toxic, with management exhibiting an authoritarian and micromanaging culture. Peer colleagues are not receptive to constructive feedback, and there is a lack of training and guidance for technicians and sales specialists. It's difficult to see any opportunities for growth within the company. Speaking up can result in ruthless retaliation from management, and there is a pattern of gaslighting employees. There is also a lack of emotional intelligence from management, with a few displaying narcissistic tendencies and racist priorities. Employees are forced to deal with emotional abuse from their colleagues, especially in-store meetings with the store leader at Apple Memorial City in Houston, Texas. Management actively discourages employees from creating a union, and the market team does not have a meaningful way for employees to advocate for themselves in the face of such poor treatment. Overall, the store locations in Market Team 4 have a damaging and hostile environment.
Advice: I would like to raise a concern regarding the lack of communication from management. Our team has found it difficult to receive clear instructions and feedback, which has led to confusion and inconsistency in our work. I would suggest providing more regular check-ins with the team, as well as setting clearer expectations and goals. This would help improve overall team efficiency and productivity and create a more positive work environment for everyone involved. During team meetings, some members have experienced rude and unprofessional behavior from management. This is unacceptable and creates a difficult work environment. It is essential to maintain a positive atmosphere in team meetings where ideas can be exchanged in a respectful manner, and everyone feels heard and valued.
Pros: Benefits are great and job opportunities with certifications are unlimited.

Cons: They don't talk about it but people be suicidal working for Apple. Almost everyone is depressed, plus I've heard of a lot people killing themselves at these jobs. I knew a guy too.

Advice: Continue to challenge your people and lead by example-that's the most important. If you don't hold yourself accountable, then your people will not follow you or respect you.

Pros: The pay and resource tools

Cons: Not once did I feel like we had a strategy or mission to work towards. Management and employees equates the launch of product to being in a war rooms, creating unnecessary metaphors to killing people if the job isn't done correctly. There was no single way to mess up this job so severely that anything even close to changing the trillion dollar bottom line was possible.

Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, nice co workers &amp; customers, lots to learn, always something new

Cons: Management has unrealistic expectations sometimes
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits additional to the job

Cons: It’s retail: inconsistent schedules which makes it incredibly hard to maintain any sort of routine or to make appointments without constantly inputting in off requests Customers: most of them are great, but the bad ones really put a sour taste in your mouth. There is a level of elitism with some customers that I haven’t experienced in other jobs, both pre and post-employment with Apple. NPS: it’s a useful tool to measure performance but too much stock is put into it considering how easy it is to drop a score. I’ve had my NPS score drop because even though the customer said my service was “impeccable”, the music in the store was too loud so they gave me a passive instead of a promoter. One detractor or passive survey drops a score so much that you have to get 5-10 promoters to make up for it. There is no appeals process to have the survey not count. It affects your numbers and can affect your raise/performance when review time comes around. Unrealistic expectations: I worked at the Genius Bar. By the time I left we were expected to take 3-4 appointments per hour where we were expected to not only troubleshoot/diagnose/resolve/check in for repair devices, but to also talk up AppleCare+, get a new business intro, talk about new products and upgrades, answer all customer questions, and learn/connect with the customer as a human. All of that CAN be done, but not in 15 minutes. That’s 1-2 appointments per hour, not 3-4. It didn’t matter how high your NPS or other metrics were, if you didn’t hit that 3-4 appointments per hour you were constantly pulled into “connections” with your connection leader to talk about it. Irritating. Leadership: inconsistent and very hit-or-miss. Some were very by-the-book and almost robotic, others were more human and understanding. Some had issues with micromanaging, no matter how many feedback conversations you had with them. Very few I felt I could actually trust. Lack of upward mobility: moving from specialist to expert is pretty easy. Anything beyond that gets significantly harder. Breaking into the corporate side is virtually impossible. Phone Support: there is a HUGE disconnect between phone support and store support. Phone support is awful, and they frequently lie and/or give incorrect information to customers, and store employees are left to clean up the mess and reset expectations.
Advice: You have got to stop playing favorites. It’s obvious, and the reason many people transferred stores or left the company entirely. When employees give you feedback, take it and implement actual solutions. We don’t want Town Halls, yearly Pulse surveys, and all-store meetings if our concerns are going to fade away into the ether as soon as you’ve gone through the “we care, we’re a family” song and dance. Take our credo to heart and remember why you’re working for Apple in the first place. Lastly, when an employee trusts you enough to ask for help in a unique situation, don’t make promises you have no intention of keeping or at least attempting to follow through on. That’s how you lose their trust completely.
Pros: Pay: pay is great. Frequent raises to keep up with cost of living and to ensure everyone in your role is around the same pay rate. Benefits: amazing; benefits team actually does listen to employees and has implemented new benefits or changed old ones to make them more favorable for employees Incentives: ESPP and stock options that vest yearly, nice discount on products The name: honestly being able to say you work or worked for Apple opens a lot of doors that would otherwise be closed or much more difficult to open otherwise

You are literally driving your tenured employees away to hire third party call centers and your clients are noticing the difference. Creating an environment of low moral and of abusive behavior from the clients who can’t cope with the change of support that Apple now offers.

Cons: Management can be shady sometimes

Advice: Focus on your employees. You’ve beaten far off the path of respect for us as people. I can’t move up in this company because it’s backwards, I’m over-qualified for corporate, yet under-qualified for retail.

Cons: There are so many insane managers it’s not even funny. Everyone will throw you under the bus for their mistakes. You can’t trust anyone in management, and even with proof of documented lying and abuse, HR will do nothing. The company claims they have plenty of policies around respect, trust, anti-abuse. It’s all a smokescreen. In general the company has a policy of inaction - whatever they can do to sweep problems under the rug, they will do.
Advice: Accountability for management. Abuse audits.
Pros: If you want to work on real products like operating systems, compilers, languages, complex apps, this is the place for you.

Cons: I was so happy working for Apple, the company that developed the first computer I played on. I hope this can offer insights into my deep childhood love and connection with Apple. Let’s fast forward to February 2019. I was promoted to work at the Valencia location as a Lead, and the team was terrific. I mean, most people at Apple are good, honest, and kind until… Three teenagers bolt into the store and start pulling demo products, and I can not tell you why. A higher power took over and had me block the door, not running after them but trying to stop them from leaving the store with the merchandise. All I can remember was thinking, “these are kids, someone’s kids jeopardizing their future.“ This is real - Has it come to a point our society is so bad that children are stealing for money? And we continue to let it happen? Alright, here’s the download… I was fired by someone I had harassment issues with, but HR claims no records of my complaints. No one interviewed me. No one attempted to discover why I did what I did, especially having no history of doing something like this. You never know what you will do until it happens. This is a moral issue, and I am not a policy issue. I had a severe mental breakdown, and it felt like I had lost a parent. Fast forward to 2021, as my injuries were yet to be determined by the Medical Examiner to be work-related ~ which was over a year after the incident. And now, three years later, Apple’s WC still refuses to reimburse EDD for the disability benefits I’ve used. The next lien conference is set for April 11, 2023. This work incident occurred on June 26, 2019. #apple #workerscomp #mentalillness #ptsd #worktrauma
Advice: Please address this issue, which others have also experienced. Thank you for reading. Maybe this can save someone’s life if not mine.

Cons: Customers can be brutal and it can take a certain personality to deal with them
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Incredible meetings of minds, great facilities, open-minded workspace, people truly care and are devoted to their work. Incredible collaboration and reliable teammates. Kind, friendly, warm, approachable, teammates who become your family. People don't feel the need to prove themselves - just want to help the team and product.

Pros: Apple is a very diversified company, in some teams you get to work on both hardware and software. If you are a person with diversified skills and backgrounds, Apple is the company for you.

Cons: it's apple, a lot of work during the hours and dealing with stressful situation
Advice: provide more benefits.
Pros: it's apple, great benefits and people around.

Cons: Absolutely toxic. This company will eat your soul and spit it back at you, at least in hardware engineering. Management collectively uses fear and shame-based motivation. Team members are expected to present frequently to large groups with lots of shame and hostility toward people who either do not have certain expected tasks complete, have not made proper judgment calls, do not have the full depth of analysis that is expected, etc even when one is burning themselves out working over 65 hrs a weak to try to keep up. As a DRI (directly responsible individual) you own everything and are expected to do everything, even though management may tell you that "some things can fall through the cracks". When you complain about "quality of life", they pretend to hear you, but will immediately try to convince you that you are wrong. The management actively gas-lights people when they complain, contributing the lack of time or bandwidth that one has to their own time management issues. Working here is like actively living in an insane asylum. There is no social life, it's just awkward, no one is encouraged to talk or socialize, just to get your work done. Pay is the only thing that keeps people here. For several years I have worked until 11-p or as late as 4am consistently for 4 days a weak, Fridays ending early sometimes as early as 6pm. I've seen people with children do this years on end, they have no life. The question is why? Is your true sense of self value derived so deeply from this work? It probably shouldn't be. But that's what Apple wants you to believe, "do your life's work here".
Advice: Become aware of the toxic ways of this culture, its abundantly clear. Hire more engineers for teams that are maxed out on bandwidth, rather than continually blaming individuals for not having results that are expected.

Advice: None
Pros: - Compensation and benefits are great. - Team is very supportive and helpful.

Cons: Pay, pay, pay! Management only cares about your metrics and the work it self is monotonous, repetitive and does not demand any of your intellectual skills. It is based on your language knowledge to improve Siri 8h/day. You struggle trying to move up because there is no positions available. If they create a position, you will compete with 100+ employees trying to get out of poverty.
Advice: Create new positions! Not only 1 every 6 months! Look at employees as valuable assets and not numbers. People are leaving because they can’t afford to pay their bills. Give them what they want!

Cons: As a chat advisor, you'll be expected to take up to 3 chats at a time. When I first started at Apple, it was only 1 chat at a time. It was increased to 3 fairly quickly but the chat quality standards never changed at all. You have 2 minutes to respond to every customer which is fine on one chat. But when you're on 3 chats at a time that means you have only 40 seconds per customer to read their message, research the answer, provide resources and explain the next step. It's nearly impossible achieve, let alone maintain for 8 hours. You're being set up to fail. Your entire life is scheduled down to the minute. You have to ask for any extra time you need away from your desk. For example, the day my dog was being put to sleep, I asked for an extra break to compose myself and was told I would need to clock out entirely for 15 minutes and take the time unpaid instead of just allowing me a small break while on the clock. At review time, you won't receive a decent raise unless you've "Exceeded" in all areas of your job but this is difficult to do when you have to ask/beg for time out of the chat queue to do special projects and make a name for yourself. It's entirely up to your specific manager whether you have the opportunity to succeed or not. Even when you are able to develop something to share with the area managers, they often drop the ball and your project goes nowhere or you find later that someone else is implementing the changes that you presented and you get no recognition for it. There's very little chance of being promoted up and out of the customer service side of the business as you won't be given the time or direction needed to improve your skills, mentor with other departments or receive any additional training outside of your role. Apple increasingly relies on vendors to provide their chat and phone customer service. The vendors have less training and are often coached to "just send it to T2" before they've even completed basic steps. Customers are frustrated because they spent time being transferred for a simple issue. As a T2 advisor, you then receive the customer's survey and you're scored down based on the actions of the T1 advisor. There is no way to reassign surveys even if the other advisor was mentioned by name and the survey clearly wasn't for you. Last year, Apple decided to move all of their internal chat advisors over to phone support. If you had an existing medical accommodation related to hearing loss or PTSD or anything else, you either had to give up your accommodation to make the move or find another job within the company that would accommodate you...which was impossible. I was put on a 30 day job search to do this and, despite a position being available for me to take that would accommodate me, I was not allowed to take it because the actual move to phone support was still upcoming. I would not be allowed into the open position until the day of the transition and the position closed before that date. I ended up reaching out to the EEOC about this who informed me that this is practice was NOT within the EEOC guidelines (An employee is supposed to receive the accommodation when THEY need it.. not when Apple needs it). Ultimately I left Apple because my last manager was extremely overbearing, very much a micro-manager and continually gave us tasks that would take us away from the chat queue but would refuse to give us additional time to complete them. Projects I had started on my previous team were taken away from me. Reports of system issues and downtime were not taken seriously and I constantly had to "cover my Apple" because any deviation away from your schedule was seen as suspicious. I recorded nearly 300 system issues resulting in downtime over a 2 year period complete with screenshots, screen recordings, internal IT tickets and personal notes but this was still not taken seriously. After asking multiple times (my area manager and HR) to be removed from this team, I was told that my manger was going on a rotation and I wouldn't have to speak to him again because of the move to phone support. However, my area manager then had him call me outside of work hours, while I was on medical leave, to ask me to login and work. I brought this back to my area manager who then responded by saying "I didn't think it was so serious".. despite my asking multiple times to be removed from a team being run by a person I found to be oppressive, hateful, and abusive. After leaving Apple, I spent about 6 months in therapy having been diagnosed with Major Depression and Agoraphobia (feeling unable to escape bad situations) caused directly by the interaction I had with the manager in question. Bottom line.. I was in an unhealthy and mentally unsafe environment and Apple REFUSED to do anything about it and even put me back into direct contact with the offender all the while ignoring and refusing to accommodate my medical status despite an option being open and available. One more thing (see what I did there?), Apple claims to believe in diversity and inclusion however this does not appear to extend to people with disabilities. Their D&amp;L website only highlights their Black@Apple and LGBTQ+ groups. Folks with disabilities are ignored and simply not highlighted or even listened to.

Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and competitive pay

Cons: Managers are bound and determined to convince you they are invested in your development because the moment you realize they aren't they will manipulate the systems in place to fire you. This is from personal experience and my case was further validated by Employee Relations siding with me and isolating the offending manager from engaging with most employees and being sent on extended, mandatory leave.
Advice: There's no advice that actually reaches managements ears and gets acted on. They operate for their own interests exclusively.

Pros: Positive Environment Great Coworkers Room for advancement.

Cons: Not enough vacation time. You build vacation/sick time by the hours you work each pay period. Management is toxic. They will hold you to standards that they themselves don’t abide by. They come and go as they please if they even show up at all yet they still get paid because they’re salary. It’s a buddy club at the management level. You have your manager, they report to an area manager, and the area manager reports to a senior area manager. They all do the same shady thing where they collect a paycheck but barely show up so you will never see a manager get fired because all of the shady behavior is just swept under the rug and hidden from upper management. Not to mention that all these different tiers of management work mostly from home so there’s nobody above them that has eyes on them. If upper management wasn’t so clueless they’d see that there’s absolutely no reason for three different tiers of management. Upper management has recently implemented a policy in which people who were working from home even long before the pandemic are no longer going to be considered for promotions unless they move to an on-site location. Management will counter that claim by saying it’s all about who you know, and developing your skills but they don’t give you time off the phones to better yourself. The training is very poor in quality too. You will never have weekends or holidays off and if you do it’s a rarity. Also, the hours of operation are horrible. AppleCare goes by Central Time hours which is 7AM-10PM Central. What this means that if you live outside of the Pacific time zone you are working later hours which is horrible in my opinion. Forget having a work-life balance if you’re on the east coast. And here’s the worst part, your schedule is not fixed. You have to bid on a new shift every few months and that process is very convoluted because it’s based on job performance, not seniority. As far as the metrics they use to judge your performance, they’re near impossible to meet. A large part of the metrics are based on customer surveys which basically means you’re on the front lines taking bad surveys from customers who are not necessarily upset at you but are angry with Apple’s products or their policies. So you’re punished with a horrible schedule for things that are entirely out of your control. Raises are not that great. If I average out my yearly pay increase since I’ve been here it comes out to an $1.78 dollar increase each year. To me that is just not great considering the cost of living and the fact that Apple has no problem giving stock grants to privileged board members.
Advice: Please take a hard look at the job abuse that is happening in the work from home space when it comes to lower level management. It’s been happening for years and it’s time for a change. Also to upper management, if you actually read this put yourself in our shoes. If you think hard enough and long enough you will see that money is being wasted on no show jobs and a lot of your policies are outdated and antiquated.
Pros: Benefits are great. Discounts are decent but could be better. Pay is not the worst but should be a lot better considering Apple is a trillion dollar company.

Cons: The management sometimes isn't the greatest You have to bid for shifts based on performance
