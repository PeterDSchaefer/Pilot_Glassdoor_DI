Cons: -Lied about what I would be doing in the internship
Advice: None
Pros: -Good program, lots to do at the tech center

Cons: New culture of treating employees badly by applying a quota for specific amount of people to give negative reviews as a way to fire people or make them quit, thereby reducing headcount to pay salaries in the new silicon valley tech office. It is the most public secret in the company.
It is the new sly way to lay people off without causing negative press.
Advice: Eventually management will be subject to the false performance reviews as they will be the last to go.  Advice is when that happens, turn off the lights on your way out.
Pros: Good salary. Chance of working on something interesting. Great place to work (if you are in silicone valley CA office).

Cons: - Low pay
- Internal politics gets in way of productivity
Advice: None
Pros: - Flexible work environment
- Supportive management

Cons: no balance, false promises, no morals, no order or professionalism, no respect between employees
Advice: None
Pros: Money, benefits, overtime when there is any

Cons: Uncertainty from upper management, strict in-office attendance
Advice: None
Pros: Good WLB, nice people, good benefits

Cons: Stressful environment since company is constantly downsizing and outsourcing jobs so there is no teamwork and it is a poor environment when everyone is competing to hold onto their job.
Advice: Review work product of GM direct workers and outsources workers to make best decision for the business.
Pros: Excellent benefits and vacation time.

Cons: Trying to use traditional GM processes in defense industry proven to be problematic. No formalized processes, constant changes of leadership, minimal stability, startup like environment, and constant fires
Advice: Hire more people - workload not manageable
Pros: All the same benefits as normal GM
Competitive pay

Cons: Senior leadership has been passing down edicts without data to back up the decisions 
We have been through 4 reorgs in the past year
We were forced to return to office while the leadership continued to be filled with fully remote positions
No clear company direction
We were told that we needed to save 2 billion dollars by reducing the workforce and cutting other costs. They said they couldn't afford the Union's demands. Then, as soon as the deal with the union was signed, they announced a $10 billion stock buyback. 
It has become clear that corporate values and company policies only apply to the workforce.
I personally do not like living in southeast Michigan. It's expensive, it's far from any outdoor activities. 

If I have to work for a company that won't include the workforce in decisions and will generally mistreat their workforce, I would at least like to live in a place I enjoy.

Most internal positions that we can apply for are only open to lateral moves, becoming very hard to get any sort of promotion.
Recent raises have not kept up with inflation at all
Advice: Back up your decisions with data. Don't lie to us. If it is just a command, then say that, don't lie and redirect.
Pros: I like my direct managers and coworkers
The pay and benefits are good

Cons: Although I worked on some interesting projects during my time there, the development timelines were so long that I didn't feel like I got a chance to see any of my design changes implemented into the vehicles. Outside of that, the Michigan cold is definitely a con if you're not from Michigan. Otherwise no real cons.
Advice: None
Pros: I was hired into the TRACK rotational program and my first job was in the CAE group. The leadership was supportive and helped me figure out my career objectives. They also allowed me to work on challenging and high-exposure projects.

Cons: Slow in promotion over all
Advice: None
Pros: Stable working at General Motors

Cons: Mediocre Product
Nearsighted strategic vision
Out sourced leadership
Depends on government intervention (money and legislation)
Advice: Shamelessly copy Toyota... but don't pollute their culture.
Pros: Good people (peers). Good environment.

Cons: Lots of hours and dedication required (doctor’s hours), but with leadership betting on high-risk ventures instead of focusing on their existing successes and making them better, it feels like the company is always on the brink and everything you have done is for not.
Advice: Focus on customer requirements and desires and stop pushing them to something they do not want or are not ready for.
Pros: Pay is great, benefits such as insurance are awesome!

Cons: Awful work life balance. Incompetent leadership that keeps cycling in and out, which leads to high turnover of valuable resources.
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits are great, and lots of opportunities to move around within the company.

Cons: Constant change in direction and flip flopping from senior leaders. Push to reduce costs while also buying back billions in stock. And now GM has instituted stack ranking for performance reviews. This will lead to people working against each other instead of together. Raises do not come close to matching inflation.
Advice: Get rid of stack ranking.  Stop buying back stock while also saying we have no money.  Give raises that match inflation.
Pros: Good pay and vacation policy.

Cons: Training and Development: While there are training programs available, some employees feel they are not sufficient or relevant to their career progression.

Work-Life Balance: Although there are flexible work arrangements, some employees still struggle with maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

Resource Allocation: There can be issues with the allocation of resources, with some departments feeling underfunded or understaffed.

Cultural Consistency: The company’s culture can vary significantly between departments and locations, leading to inconsistencies in the employee experience.
Advice: None
Pros: General Motros offers competitive salaries and comprehensive benefits packages

Cons: It can be very busy at times and sometimes has a lot of paperwork
Advice: None
Pros: Fun job, great vacation and holidays, team was very supportive.

Cons: - Not too much direction from the Senior Leadership Team.
- GEBS organization managers do not talk highly of their bosses in team meetings.
- As a TRACK Engineer if you are placed in an area where the manager does not like you, most likely will be terminated.
- Management will NOT tell you the truth.
- Have to fight for your growth and realize no one is your friend at the company.
- Always keep a written record of reviews and 1 on 1's and save your copies as HR will never send you copies.
Advice: Not like they will listen to me anyway. Overall some managers truly care for their teams and want the team to succeed. Other managers will tell you how good you are doing and will give pretty vague advice. The people in a team directly relate to how the team and work environment is rather than how "smart" the team might be. Give your TRACK Engineers a chance to grow and positive advice instead of terminating them for "not having a sense of urgency" or lying to them about being excited to see their positive improvements in the future.
Pros: - The TRACK program allows you to rotate into different areas and learn about the company and different groups and their cultures.
- The TRACK group itself is outstanding and creates events and scenarios to settle into a new place and company as large as GM.
- The people make the team, not the area or your work. Certain team members will take the time to teach you and help you in a new role, but most will ignore you.
- Certain managers and Lead Engineers care for growth from a New College Hire and want them to succeed.

Cons: -was on a team where we were changing project every two weeks for a period of 6 months to a year. That meant we learned a lot but were masters of nothing. 
- whole building was laid off after being told there were no more layoffs. So current upper management is not very trustworthy.
- not flexible about remote work
Advice: None
Pros: -got hands on experience on a lot of different technology (Java/springboot angular react etc)
-great people all willing to help 
-if you’re interested in a different career choice they are willing to work with you to find you a spot on a different team that matches your interests
-great benefits and decent bonuses 
-work life balance was excellent 
*this is from the college entry level perspective

Cons: Pay isn't up to level it should be. Depending on team your in your growth and promotions are decided not based on your work. Your work load greatly varies depending on your team. Leadership chases newest coolest trends instead of working on core product and bettering that. California Leadership treats rest of the company as less than them.
Advice: GM should stop chasing and getting apple laid of people they release code to prod once in year.  It doesn't really compare.  You can create bad company at anytime. Just remember the reason people come to GM for reason leverage those instead of swimming with same way.  Long term it will help GM.
Pros: work on devices that people take there families in instead of hold them in there hands. Tech is cool and interesting.

Cons: Bad senior leadership, poor decisions, constant churn of decisions wasting resources
Advice: None
Pros: Good co-workers, fair benefits, great vacation and holidays

Cons: Complex and intense work with little releveling. Burnout is real.

Cons: Unorganized, forced to wear many hats, lack of resources to spread amongst teams
Advice: Have scrum leads to help organize ADO so developers can focus on development
Pros: May get to work on interesting automotive technology. Also big on AI

Cons: Long work hours and work weeks
Advice: None
Pros: Salary is very competitive with in the industry

Cons: Very long hours working 6 days a week.
Advice: Get rid of 3rd shift and 6 days
Pros: Really good money if you want it.

Cons: some managament is super toxic. swore at me alot.
Advice: None
Pros: good bonus, good insurance, easy job

Cons: Large company leads to bureaucratic road blocks
Advice: None

-People working there are pretty cool

Cons: Work load had ups and downs.

Cons: The return to work situation isn't being handled the best,
Advice: None
Pros: Good work-life balance and flexible working hours

Cons: Return to office mandate is 3 days/week but not consistent across organizations. Depends on your leadership 
Underpaid for the market
Advice: None
Pros: Discounts on GM brand cars

Cons: Still some “old school” leaders lurking that are holding up progress. 
Arden Hoffman is the worst thing to happen to GM since the bankruptcy and ignition recall. Idk what mtb was thinking choosing her to lead HR. The culture that was built over time was destroyed when Arden came in and replaced with toxicity. 
Unclear what the mission is - so convoluted now, with not enough focus on what the company actually does… build cars and trucks.
Negotiating salary internally is impossible. New hires earning more than me in the same role and I had been there 15 years.
Advice: Quit massive hiring sprees followed by deep cuts. Get rid of Arden before she causes GM to have a massive scandal like she caused at cruise because of a culture of fear. Pick a clear vision. Take a lesson from GE and quit trying to be something you’re not. Embrace the fact you’re a manufacturing company… not a tech company.
Pros: Learning opportunities, being part of something large, the relationships with colleagues.

Cons: Not much creativity 
Boring 
very hard to move teams 
not much growth for some people
Advice: More room to grow and we should be able to move teams especially when your skills don't align after a reorg
Pros: work life balance 
set amount of tasks 
standard IT company

Cons: Workload is overwhelmed since many have left and teams are small
Advice: Hire more people
Pros: Vacation days are 20 after 2 years

Cons: Disruptive and ineffective leaderships
Poor communication 
SLOW product cycles
Inadequate medical insurance
Advice: Don’t use new leadership hires and reorganizations blind you and your employees from what’s important! Create tangible plans before initiating big changes and follow through. Change the HIPPO culture!
Pros: Work life balance
Holidays
Low toxicity culture

Cons: Chaos management or leadership brought by SLT since end of 2022,
And the forced back to office policy caused center or site couldn't provide enough cubes to fit everyone which means you have to share cubes or use hotel cubes when you back to office. While the policy required 3 days back and 2 days remote still seems working fine but if 5 days back office I can guarantee not a center will have enough workplace for everyone to sit down.
Advice: Direct report basically what I experienced are super nice people, even upper to some senior manager and director level.
But things changed when leadership level up to SLT, GM colleagues knows well recent times.
Pros: Good work life balance
At average or bit higher salary at local area, fair though not very high compare to Bay area, WA, etc;
Besides, direct report basically have good support and co-workers are super friendly and willing to help and listen.
Also provided many resources for self-learning and training programs as well.

Cons: Work load had ups and downs.
Advice: None
Pros: Hybrid work environment made for a good balance

Cons: Lots of politics and nepotism. A boys club. Fake interviews for "fairness" when they already have the person.
Advice: The interview quota is not fair of ethical if the hiring manager had decided on a candidate. It's okay to hire within that way but don't act like it's open to all and waste people's time and emotions.
Pros: Competitive, good bonus, good benefits

Cons: My latter 2 years on the other hand were terrible. Upper management was constantly pressuring our managers to make us work faster all while threatening layoffs and lying about the state of the company. The latter half of my service at GM I did not feel valued at all as an employee and if the same culture persists I would never recommend anyone work there.
Advice: Be more transparent and stop lying about whether layoffs are happening. Value the human beings who are working so hard for your benefit.
Pros: My first year at GM was pretty chill and I was working on interesting projects and was given a lot of room to learn.

Cons: Constant fear of next layoff or downsizing. 
Raises have not paced inflation or state of economy.
Little opportunity for advancement without high level support. 
Company prefers DEI initiatives over skills, experience, and abilities,
Advice: Many jobs should be remote.
Raises should account for inflation. 
Leaders should be evaluated by employees.
Pros: High profile / industry recognized company.

Cons: Career progression is slow. Will have to wait for long time
Advice: None
Pros: Good place for learning new technologies

Cons: Cooperate mind set at all levels
Advice: None
Pros: Money is great at times

Cons: No major cons at GM
Advice: None
Pros: I joined working at GM

Cons: Slow growth unless you switch roles
Advice: None
Pros: 3 day RTO and 2 days wfh

Cons: Management changing constantly with no clear goals
Advice: None
Pros: Being allowed to contribute and showcase your skills

Cons: Only 2-3% raise a year
Have to switch jobs internally to get a 8-12% raise 
Favoritism is real 
Senior leadership doesn’t care about anyone but themselves
Advice: None
Pros: Good salary starting out and good bonus

Cons: Not a very good place to move up and make more money
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to learn new things as a new graduate

Cons: No work/life balance. The culture here is horrible. They come up with a new way to lay ppl off every 6 weeks. Everyday at work is like clocking in at the Hunger Games. Avoid this place if possible. Find an employer that actually values you as an employee.
Advice: Why bother? They don't care.
Pros: In this current job market, it's better than being unemployed.

Cons: “Return to work” policy with no exceptions eliminates or extremely limits opportunities for staying with the company or career growth there if you aren’t near a major office. Attempts at diversity feel performative because they aren’t backed up in practice.
Advice: Actually listen to and follow feedback
Pros: Solid pay and benefits. Good opportunities for growth if you want that but also plenty of roles you can stay in longer term. Good work life balance in most roles.

Cons: I would not go to General Motors if not out of school. It's a place where people quickly get put into groups (high potential (HIPOT) or not) and if you get placed in the not high potential group; you get written off. I saw it so much. On the flip side, if you get placed in HIPOT, you can get away with being mediocre. 

Management also did not seem authentic. They can switch things up on employees at any time. You were also expected to fall in line and be agreeable. Ruffling feathers was frowned which is not always a good thing. This is where the "GM Nod" concept came from; where people will agree with you to your face and either resist behind your back or resent you.
Advice: None
Pros: I would say it is hard to get fired. GM would rather humiliate you by downleveling you or effectively, writing you off; than separate. Work life balance was decent in most groups. Perhaps, the story is different in manufacturing. WLB is definitely hit or miss.

Cons: Deadlines are always hard to meet
Advice: None
Pros: Great people to work with

Cons: Stressful environment a lot of blame game leadership has no emotional intelligence and not all but a lot of your staff can be difficult to work with depending on the shift and culture at that Plant.
Advice: Stop working your people to death… fix the management vs union mentality. Speak to people better! Include a vehicle in the salary package (like you do for level 8 shift leaders) for group leaders after 18months of service.
Pros: Great pay! You learn a lot and really get to utilize your problem-solving skills if that’s something you enjoy.

Cons: Not enough benefits compared to software industry
Advice: None
Pros: a great place to work

Cons: no cons i can say about
Advice: None
Pros: great company to work for

Cons: I don't feel elevated by the talent there. There are some very talented people, but it feels like most of the people are there because they couldn't find any other jobs, and it shows. Additionally, there aren't many growth opportunities.
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, great work life balance.

Cons: So far everything is good
Advice: None
Pros: Good Benefits, Great work-life balance, Hybrid.

Cons: Too much paperwork and not enough common sense. 

As a supervisor you essentially have two bosses; Management and the UAW.
Advice: Reduce the amount of bureaucracy
Pros: Salary and benefits are good

Cons: Hires talent for one role and then places them into a completely different one.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, good pay, lots of PTO

Cons: constant stream of layoffs, leadership is dishonest about company direction
Advice: None
Pros: pay is decent, work/life balance is not bad

Advice: None
Pros: nice team atmosphere and good work life balance

Cons: Too much work to do
Advice: 5 days a week
Pros: Good pay and compensation good

Cons: None i can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Great leadership and great opportunity for advancement

Cons: Senior management, churn, DEI nausea,
Advice: None
Pros: Good people and a lot of opportunity

Cons: Can be very difficult starting here with no experience as your fate relies solely upon the luck of which team you get placed and how familiar they are with people new in the field
Advice: Learn how to treat people that have no experience in their field. Also for senior management, more transparency would reduce work anxiety by a lot.
Pros: Perfect place to work for experienced people within their field, generally very relaxed environment where you set the precedent for how hard your work will be.

Cons: Being such a large company, it takes significant time to impact change. At times it can feel like you’re not making a difference and just checking boxes. Self-motivation can be challenging.
Advice: None
Pros: The work life balance is prioritized in many of the marketing functions. Also, being a larger company, there’s tons of resources during strategy development. You never have to feel like it’s all on you.

Cons: Stressful and unsure work environment
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits and time off

Cons: It felt like a giant high school where is a divide between the “haves” and the “have nots.” Good luck changing that if you are middle management and not a lifer or a director+
Advice: None
Pros: Some great people, opportunity and proactive systems and processes

Cons: Management is generally clueless at running business
Advice: None
Pros: Don’t have to be technically competent

Cons: Roles can be extremely siloed. Becoming an SME in your own area of the business often tunnels the utility you can provide and removes the potential for new skills to be developed. Your skills become less and less transferable if you don't prioritize your own professional development on the business side of the company.
Advice: Reversing the commitments made in recent years such as keeping annual salary raises consistent with inflation and allowing for permanent work from home solutions has created a sense of distrust with senior leadership.
Pros: GM's benefits package, salary commitments, and level of responsibility granted to new employees is unmatched. Especially for students with undecided futures and general business degrees, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to take on managing my own sector of the business in many other companies.

Cons: None at the moment that I know of
Advice: None
Pros: Hard working determined driven individuals 


Cons: Getting promoted is a really hard
Advice: None
Pros: Good company overall with good work life balance

Cons: Pay increases didn’t keep up with economy. New hires were starting with more than experienced folks. Closed down the AZ site, laying off a lot of people.
Advice: Know your loyal employees worth. Help them grow (including salary). Don’t be a “yes man”  just to make yourself look good.
Pros: Benefits. PTO. Paid holidays. Work environment was chill. Colleagues were great.

Cons: Slow Pace,
Software side not very well managed yet
Advice: None
Pros: Better work life balance,
Growth opportunities,
Supportive Management

Cons: Promotions for most require patience and a big project success.
Advice: Pay attention to communication from direct reports as much as that from your leadership.
Pros: Stable employer through the good times and bad. The company respects employees, highly values safety, and works hard to be a desirable workplace.

Cons: Promotions for most require patience and a big project success.
Advice: Pay attention to communication from direct reports as much as that from your leadership.
Pros: Stable employer through the good times and bad. The company respects employees, highly values safety, and works hard to be a desirable workplace.

Cons: Complex corporate culture with a lot of bureaucratic hurdles.
Advice: None
Pros: Good experience with managers and good benefits.

Cons: Local union sucks
Management doesn’t care
Hard physical work
Advice: None
Pros: Union benefits are great. Once out of temp status pay is good

Cons: GM is a more old school company with old school values. They do not hold up to the infrastructure, code quality, or amenities that many software engineers have come to expect. They want to rebrand themselves as a tech company but are a bit lost in how to make that happen.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay (for the area), little to no overtime required (depending on your role), getting to work in a field that is actually newly emerging with lots of potential (EVs), plenty of different areas to work in.

Cons: Their lack of everything is what caused me to leave.
Advice: None
Pros: Their insurance is what kept me there.

Cons: Practical top level competitive decision making
Advice: None
Pros: Good working environment to work

Cons: I do not have any Cons.
Advice: I do not have any advice here.
Pros: I really enjoy working at General Motors! The people are great and the work environment and the opportunities are good as well!

Cons: 1) Poor management: forcing RTO while parking/desks/traffic situation was clearly not thought-out beforehand while the California-based executives complain in APMs about employees complaining, also pricy cafeteria food and no free coffee.
2) Being treated like an overpaid intern/guinea pig running around doing manual tasks like pushing buttons and moving heavy equipment from building to building, and not being allowed to do the tasks managers claimed you would be able to do despite voicing concerns to the team and leadership.
3) No/little on-boarding or documentation in many teams. Some teams are so overrun with work so there is no/little help even if you reach out when needed. They are also ill-prepared to take in new people. 
4) Bad work life culture: heard a colleague say that you might need to work evenings and weekends without extra pay "just like you did in college!" (as if they are comparable), managers pinging you late at night or during vacation, managers aggressively pointing fingers at other managers over Teams calls, and working the contract employees to the bone (ex: pressuring one to not even take time off when they just had a baby).
Advice: None
Pros: Networking opportunities, regular social events, ability to test-drive cool vehicles. There is a diversity/inclusion employee group.

Cons: The competitive nature of the automotive industry can create a high-pressure work environment with demanding deadlines and performance expectations.
Advice: None
Pros: GM promotes a healthy work-life balance through flexible work arrangements, remote work options, and various employee wellness programs.

Cons: The only con I can think of is the org changes. Teams swap every couple of months, so just get used to meeting new people. This could also be considered a benefit for making connections.
Advice: Nope.
Pros: Here's a list:
1) Community: Most engineer here are very friendly and want to help for newbies such as I,
2) Salary: The salary is not terrible, especially if you compare to the national average.
3) Work: My role/work as a TRACK engineer has been enjoyable, GM is putting a considerable amount of time and money to try to grow its future employees.
4) Benefits: The benefits are top tier. Great insurance, great pay, great healthcare.

Cons: -the noises never stop. veterans with PTSD are in for a harrowing experience if you choose to work here,
-they want all the personal information on your place of worship to allow you to have your religion. making your new religion the manufacturing of cars.
-the only requirement for working in vehicle assembly is a pulse, so buyers beware. I'm telling everyone i know to never buy anything manufactured by GM ever,
-Admittedly nobody acknowledges that HR is there for them, but in reality the only time that they show up is to pull the rug out from underneath you.
Advice: be leaders not management.
Pros: the pay is consistent and always comes every friday

Cons: I hate seeing leaders workload triple since the reorganizations. 
Constant shifts and changes which overwhelm leaders on retraining, learning and delegating.
The constant fear of getting doxxed.
Unreasonable demands and changes.
Being in autotmotive period.
Advice: Look above and all the other reviews
Pros: There are some wonderful knowledgeable people here that invest the time into their employees and support their work life balance.
Leadership development program in some parts of the company are a great transition for college students.

Cons: Insane bureaucracy and politics, (mostly) terrible senior leadership, EV situation is a complete disaster, forced return to office at least 3 days a week (for most employees), nepotism is a problem, DEI initiatives are forced down employees throats, zero career development for most, qualified/experienced individuals very rarely get promotions they deserve.
Advice: Spend less time trying to impress Wall Street and trying to be like Tesla. Spend more time on things that actually make the company money and sell cars.
Pros: Decent benefits, pay, flexibility, 6% matching 401K, 12-week parental leave, annual HSA contribution.

Cons: - Hard to move up, very large company
Advice: None

Paychecks come on time

Cons: none at this time right now
Advice: None
Pros: Work life Balance
Good Pay for the area

Cons: Constant re-orgs
Industry that is flailing around trying things (i guess every industry that isn't Generative AI or HW related to Generative AI is flailing right now)
Despite all the rolling layoffs and cuts, there are *still* a core group of people that are just not open to change.
Advice: I don't have a Harvard, or Wharton MBA, and I never worked for a "tech company" as a data scientist or a senior leader ... so why would management listen to anything I say lol? I can't juice the stock price, or magically change the "global competitive landscape and the headwinds we face". I am just here to be as useful as possible till I am inevitably laid off.
Pros: good Salary for the region. Good bonuses.
Nice and competent colleagues that actually show up and try to work and are very helpful.
Direct leaders are good.

Pros: GM has competitive compensation and benefits. As a large complex company there are opportunities for diverse experiences and specializations.

Cons: Management is mainly a bunch of former sales people and accountants.

The software in the company is literally the worst I've ever seen.

Management doesn't actually understand how modern software development works and just chases fads and plays buzzword bingo. Why? Because they don't actually know what they're doing.

Due to how bad GM is, it's difficult to leave because most companies don't want to hire ex-GM. Terrible rep.

Advice: Do better.
Pros: Benefits, bonus, and pay are great.

Cons: The downsides of GM is that it, like most companies, is always changing. Salespeople stay in roles from 6 months to 2 years maximum. Direction from Detroit were always done from their perspective, not realizing that a smaller office has different needs. It was challenging to stay within company guidelines when those guidelines were drawn from farther away.
Advice: The concept of simplification and doing more with less should apply to the people managing, not those DOING.  Having to do one job is enough, being asked to take on 3 different positions is too much.
Pros: Working at GM is like a huge chaotic family reunion; some things are amazing and other times contentious. If you are passionate about cars it is amazing to see the latest innovations and be a part of it. The small office atmosphere for the Sales branches had a feel of a cooperative small office.

Fantasy Island....
Unstable software

Advice: It was said during the end of year speech, at GM motorsports  "We are a family and the foundation of a family is built on trust" During the interview I was told lies about this position. Thus my "relationship", with my new family was founded on lies. Management should be proud they have created such a "knives in back", extremes politics and potentially life wrecking environment for employees. You need to change the unethical people in leadership of GM motorsports software. Lastly, it also very telling of how this team is managed when you are on your 7th PO/PM in 3 years....

Cons: A few roles do most of the work.
Hard to be meaningfully recognized. 
Bonus structure is based on level with little flexibility. 
New hires get paid more than 2-3 years worth of merit increases in same role. 
But that’s just corporate for you, they’re probably much better than most.
Advice: Get into the weeds and add value to the work that we provide you with. Too many managers are simply middle men that lost their edge as an individual contributor and never had the vision for business leadership. Some leaders are great, others just yell at suppliers.
Pros: Good work life balance.

Advice: None
Pros: Lots of perks, freedom within the company, people were friendly.

Cons: Automotive is a scary place to be right now. Upper management is lost with this move to EV and has ruined many careers with their arrogance. Unless you’re a woman your growth potential is minimal. Pay wage is not keeping up with inflation and good luck getting promoted. Work your life away with little satisfaction and the only perk of the job is vehicle discounts on overpriced vehicles that cost as much as your yearly wage. Not what it used to be 20 years ago.

- Interesting Product to Development
- Some roles come with awesome perks, such as testing on the proving grounds or seeing the product before anyone else (even within the company)

Pros: Good opportunity to get yourself out there and learn important skills

Cons: Bureaucracy to the extreme.  Often purely for the sake of it, adding no value or safe guards. Leadership changes constantly making it hard to connect with what the "vision of the day" is. With that vagueness, many don't have a good goal post to work towards and seem to languish while a few work way to hard to push the product through the machine.
Advice: Invest in your technical leaders more and silicone valley less.
Pros: Some really cutting edge stuff to work on with room to collaborate and invent.  Rewarding in positions I have had to be close to the final product and drive what you worked on.  There are some really smart people here, and if you align with them there is a lot to learn.

Cons: No work life balance, working on weekends alot
Advice: None
Pros: Guranteed bonus if you meet expectations

Cons: Like any large company, there are some frustrations when it comes to big initiatives being rolled out. The pendulum can swing widely from one direction to another.
Advice: Suggestion would be to hold managers, execs, and sr. execs more accountable.  If a large initiative, program, etc. is not successful, make sure the feedback gets to them and if not corrected, promote up and comers who are more nimble and can get the job done.
Pros: GM has some of the best people to learn from. Everyone is extremely helpful and wants you to be successful. There are also numerous career opportunities and different parts of the business that you can learn and you're encouraged to do so.

Pros: Bonus has been tremendous for the last decade. Flexible work environment. Many amenities on-campus (food, coffee, gym, etc.). Benefits are great. Pay is great.
