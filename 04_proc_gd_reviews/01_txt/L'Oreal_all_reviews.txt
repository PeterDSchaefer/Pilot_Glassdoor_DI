Cons: For MT Program rotations place you in NYC, north New Jersey, or south New Jersey so it can be costly for transportation based on your housing location since you rotate every 8 months
Advice: None
Pros: Strong 2 year development program, quick to climb corporate ladder, employee benefits on products

Cons: Management needs to improve their hiring
Advice: None
Pros: A lot of room to grow

Cons: HR turnover leading to an impersonal relationship with management blocking upward mobility, employee rewards like titles, promotion and salary
Advice: The best companies put employee compensation and rewards ahead of stock holder dividends. Promote and reward from within the company as that is what made Loreal what it is today.
Pros: Corporate ethics, Environmental and Social stewardship, new management approach and training, some nice perks (company store, volunteer days..)

Cons: Sometimes navigating the structure of power can be hard esp if you feel your immediate boss does not take in your views as quickly as you want
Advice: At the moment, none
Pros: L'Oréal is always pushing the boundaries with new products and ideas, making it an exciting place to work because they incorporate our sales ideas into their products.

Cons: High pressure and fast paced environment, great for some, not great for others.
Advice: None
Pros: great for growth and career developement

Cons: - poor leadership and bad management you will be worked to the bone 
- HR and leadership don’t have any formal structure for promotions and raises 
- archaic technologies and work practices this company is so far behind!
- the salary is a joke, incredibly non competitive with the market
Advice: Have clear goals for promotions and raises. HR needs to be called out on this they are doing a poor job. 

Also no one gets fired here, if you have underperforming employees or senior leadership who are hurting a department they should be let go!
Pros: - Profit sharing program you’re pretty much guaranteed a bonus every year
- access to the company store you receive 50% off all brands. There is a free goods program but it’s not enough money.

Cons: senior leadership is very much lacking in empathy and does not seem to care about the actual people
Advice: show more real empathy and care
Pros: working with a lot of great, talented people and opportunities to grow

Cons: Lacks community - Needs more interns events
Advice: None
Pros: Interesting company, fun projects, engaging

Cons: Base salary, stress, workload, out of touch upper management
Advice: PAY the good ones. It's more expensive to hire someone to fill our roles. When roles are eliminated or people leave, either fill the role or pay the people that have to pick up the slack to do the now two jobs they're doing.
Pros: Benefits, paid time off, hybrid work

Cons: All teams are lean and overworked and the culture is toxic.
Advice: Train on healthy boundaries and communication.
Pros: The work is fun and entrepreneurial.

Cons: Safety Manager, Looks exactly like Mr Bean. Behaves like Napoleon. He constantly brags about "I run the plant" and tells leaders that he doesnt like that he "will not be inviting them to his lake house."
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible work hours, constant state of change, they do a good job of indoctrinating employees and building morale. Leadership at this company is more about marketing yourself for the next job than it is about successfully completing the Job at hand. This creates a culture where people try to climb over each other to reach the top of the mountain. Collaboration is disingenuous, because people are merely playing the game to reach the next position. Loreal is a Marketing Company at heart, and this permeates through the entire business to the leadership on the manufacturing floor. Trust of peers is non-existent, Its all about your ability to sell yourself for the next job....and stepping on the back of the next guy to get it done. The only this company remains successful is they make a product that cost 2 dollars and they sell it for 22 dollars.

Cons: Not much to complain at this journey.
Advice: Try to minimize the numbers of unnecessary meetings.
Pros: Encourage people to strike balance of work and life. Never ask to work on the weekend!

Cons: There’s no level playing ground. Very much a ‘who you know’ to help your career movement and progression. Environment depends on your boss and team so can be very diff at one place vs another.
Advice: Get rid of senior management that isn’t engaging or hasn’t helped move your companny/brand forward. You pay some of these people so much when in reality they haven’t really accomplished anything, don’t mentor to build the team, and team under them does all the work for zero credit/reward
Pros: Good benefits and they are really trying to be better company with additional focus on well being. Lots of resources for different information but also means a lot of different opinions on your business.

Cons: Management will support dishonest employees to go ahead and not the actual good ones.
Advice: None
Pros: More number of leaves, yearly gifts

Cons: Transfer of shared services for the payroll department was subpar. Too many of the legacy team left due to not being able to relocate and the ones left did not share all of their knowledge. There are gaps and constant fires to put out. Current leaders have unrealistic expectations for workload, knowledge transfer, process improvements. Constant changes and not allowing team to learn a process in full. Aside from departmental concerns the salary increase wasn’t even enough to adjust for cost of living and very disappointing.
Advice: They need to push work away from the department that isn’t payroll related. Improve work life/balance by bringing in more staff and not allowing burn out. Also to have a better understanding of what their subordinates do because they don’t understand a lot of the processes we do and in turn cannot effect change or provide the support we need.
Pros: Free goods, benefits, hybrid schedule, yearly bonus.

Cons: The work environment at L'Oreal was toxic, they like to fire older employees just before retirement after they invested years into the company. They would also pay and give higher people coming from outside without experience or any knowledge much more that people who spent years in Loreal. They also like to promote people based on who you know and how good you kiss upper management’s behind. All money and experience you get from L’Oreal is not worth mental health that you loose shortly after joining the company. People are pressured to achieve their unreasonable goals , they don’t train you and they like to play finger pointing and malicious political games, we used to joke how L’Oreal must screw you at least once while you are there. I was there for 6 years and regret every single day spent in that toxic environment , I regret not suing them for the anxiety and depression I experienced for the first time in my life because of this company. Leaving this place and connecting with former employees made me realize I was not the only one. I joined L’oreal fresh out of college and I was constantly reminded how great of a company L’Oreal is and how we would not get smarter or better anywhere else, but omg I can’t express how much happier I’ve been since I left this hell.
Advice: more training , less politics , more respect for people who invested years into the company, don't be so cheap on company spending and learn to lead by example and by investing in people
Pros: Company Store Discounts and nothing else

Cons: Will throw you under the bus as a scapegoat
Advice: Prepare new employee with all the politics he/she will be challenged with
Pros: Pension Plan after 5 years

Cons: Managing complex relationships with internatl partners.
Advice: None
Pros: Interesting and challenging work. Opportunities to grow.

Toxic supervisors
Don’t accept mistakes and no reasoning whatsoever
Advice: Nothing…it only falls on deaf’s ears
Pros: Free cosmetics evey 4mos, grab bag on december, bonus beginning of year

Cons: Diversity initiative is mostly just for show. Advancement almost purely relies on politics. Expectations are not equal and overt favoritism is rampant. Trust is non existent as the culture is extremely dog eat dog. If you don’t fall in line with the status quo it will be very painfully obvious that you’re not accepted. If you’re an immigrant, woman of color, or older than 50, it’s likely you’ll either be ignored or pushed out of the company. Toxic managers are usually promoted and protected. There is no pre-established way of doing things so onboarding is a nightmare and anytime there’s personnel change it feels like starting over from zero. Headcount runs ridiculously lean in some business critical departments while other departments are over staffed. 401k contribution vests after 5 years which is abnormally high for the industry.
Advice: Continue to focus on the importance of psychological safety because there is a lot of work that needs to be done. A place of work shouldn’t feel like high school where the popular kids run the show. Transparent communication and feedback about promotion decisions seriously needs to be enforced. Instead of virtue signaling actually lead by example when it comes to communicating the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Pros: Free product, great company store, overall good work life balance (depending on your team and manager).

Advice: None
Pros: Great leadership, good benefits, office is nice

Cons: So many cons. The pay isn’t very good. They hire smart people but don’t let them have any of their own ideas. Everyone in management is stressed but can’t quit for professional reasons or they have too much power in this company they rather stay and bully the workers they manage. If you are a feeling human being, you have no place here. If you are not white you are not valued here.
Advice: Stop being bullies.

Cons: The work-like balance is tough to manage but not impossible. 
They also force you now to come into the office on Fridays at least 2x a week.
Advice: If Leadership can set boundaries on work hours ending at 5pm, then the rest will follow.  I still don’t see enough people of color in positions of power here.
Pros: You will feel like you earned your MBA without going back to school. You will be challenged and developed if blessed with a manager that evokes the right skills to get you there. L’Oreal expects you to get promoted within 18 months. You will receive perks like immense swag, gratis, and company store allowance. And you’ll build relationships with sister brands where the networking is endless. Working for the biggest beauty brand in the world can only help your resume and professional trajectory.

When leadership has inappropriate relationships with interns they will be 'fast-tracked' to a VP role and moved to NY... Management is so belittling and condescending and now they have wiped the HR and put in a new HR team that does nothing. There is no support for the people. Absolutely toxic place to work.
Advice: Get a soul and treat people with respect. Leadcom including HR team could learn a lot by putting PEOPLE first.

Free Product.....

Advice: None
Pros: amazing atmosphere loved working there

Cons: Hierarchy, internal politics, reactiveness, inability to innovate.
Advice: L’Oreal is an amazing company to have on your resume, rightfully so as they have key leaders in executive positions that are appropriately steering the teams in the right direction. They challenge you and continue to push your limits, striving to weed out the best of the best. I agree with this approach 100%.

However, the many many layers from France, to NA c-level, to division heads, to brand heads, to specific department leaders, convolutes messaging, approvals and more importantly, direction. There was also (unsure if still currently) a picking of sides within the org, to determine if your voice would be heard: side 1: follow existing protocol, business as usual, if things go array, follow the current path and don’t challenge or question. Side 2: innovate, think outside the box, challenge why things were done a certain way to see if there is an improved alternative. There was a very small contingent supporting side 2, which was great, to a point when it was supported by senior stakeholders (senior being key). However, with internal changes, you lose the support of those willing to innovate and an overwhelming support for keeping things business as usual. I went through 3 bosses over 6 months and no one bothered to question. I even asked 1 of said bosses after a meeting that I want to know that I have your support in a meeting if there is a difference of opinion and I was told verbatim “you have to navigate the room and play the audience, if you feel them siding one way, you too have to go that way.” I saw this first hand thereafter in followup meetings where we previously aligned on one direction but when a superior questioned, the entire room abandoned the initial direction to support said superior’s comment. I stuck with it but felt I was alone on an island which changed my whole perspective in the ways of working. 

Reacting to competitors and others in the marketplace unfortunately was a constant, versus initiating and piloting. Hopefully things have changed since but as the #1 beauty player in the world, I would expect calculated risks being part of a global strategy. 

Overall, I’m glad and appreciative of my time here and wouldn’t do it any other way as it made me who I am today. However, a fair psa to incoming talent, to manage expectations, you will be pushed but will be better for you in the long run. To management, please embrace change and new ways of thinking, perhaps challenge ways of working for sake of complacency.
Pros: Pay scale, bonus, benefits and facility. Challenging work (which is a benefit in my eyes), being part of a global, #1 beauty player company, across a multi channel structure, which will open many different perspectives as this is atypical from your standard retailer. Confrontation is collaboration. Survival of the fit.

Cons: Way of working not efficient, systems are very antiquated and not used properly, little guidance on certain streams and teams.
Advice: None
Pros: Great discount on products, good people, work is not stressful

Cons: Company can be slow moving at times. Being more nimble could help.

Cons: - forced to come into the office when it has already been proven that productivity doesn't waver with a full WFH model
- promotion criteria remains a very gray area
Advice: - allow employees to come into the office on a 'as needed/if needed' basis. We are all so accustomed to working and collaborating through Teams, it is completely unnecessary to come into the office, only to continue to take all meetings through Teams
Pros: - Free goods allowance
- opportunity to learn and grown
- 401k matching
- pension
- great maternity/paternity leave

Cons: strong work culture- in office, big corporate company, NYC based -- best to live and work there for furthest carrier developement
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: The benefits and PTO time are good and they have a pension plan.

Cons: Nothing I can say is bad
Advice: None
Pros: Great work environment to work

Cons: Oh where to begin... It is for one, so disorganized that no one ever has any idea as to what is going on. Second, you will never be fully trained on anything and no one will ever be available to help you yet they expect you to do everything 100% correctly. None of the upper level employees are friendly. oh also, not to mention that since this is a French Company, we were fully expected to work on the 4th of July and were not able to even request off since it was month end. After a year of good work, I submitted my (overly nice) resignation letter, offering to help in any way I could, and gave 2 weeks notice and my boss never even responded to me. She never thanked me for anything I did and never even said goodbye to me. It was an absolutely awful place to work.
Advice: None

Cons: Internally there are a lot of processes
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work.
Amazing coworkers and managers

Cons: Toxic culture. HR is basically PR for the company. Gossipy/negative managerial culture is fostered from the top that creates a culture of looking out for just oneself - often at the expense of putting down others. It's really a shame, because these are some of the smartest people in the industry. This is a french, male dominated company. They consider having a older, white American male US CEO as "diverse" - they pat themselves on the back for this. That tells you something about how out of touch they are.
Advice: Stop approaching inclusivity from the white male gaze. Inclusivity and advocacy needs buy-in from the majority by incentivizing participation. Inclusivity is not just a POC or minority's problem to solve - it is everyone's problem to solve. More transparency on how promotions and salary work.
Pros: Good benefits - pension is unusual these days!

Cons: French culture can be slightly much sometimes but they are reasonable

Pros: Depending on your team, it can be a great work place. Plenty of work to do.

Cons: Could be better benefits/more maternal leave/etc
Advice: None

Cons: Work-life balance is messed up.

Cons: There was no support at all and interns are treated differently in different locations. It all depends on where you go. For me, I was bombarded with a bunch of work meant for two people with no help. I also had no work life balance.
Advice: I suggest you look after all your interns. Everyone is getting treated differently in different locations. Some interns get help to start full time jobs right after the internship and others get no help. My experience was stressful and very unprofessional.
Pros: The pros about this internship is you got to see the backend of how companies work and you do meet wonderful people.

Cons: Don’t have any to report
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, great job, would recommend!

Cons: Tough work life balance Systems that are quite antiquated for the scale of work Didn’t feel appreciated amongst my partners in the role, which made doing the job quite unbearable at times Felt stretched thin
Advice: Great management just think they could stick up better for their reports. Often felt steamrolled because there was an expectation to meet all of our partner’s needs no matter how tedious and time it would take away from being analytical in our role.

Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, room for growth

Cons: My boss would yell at me and curse at me if I made mistakes. Would not give me constructive feeeback and used every opportunity to put me down. Training was hard because I’d request time on co workers calendars and they’d cancel last minute and then my boss got mad I didn’t get trained and wouldn’t hold the people supposed to be training me accountable. Glorified working 10-12 hour shifts in production plant

Cons: Poor communication from corporate office about important store or company policy changes affecting the stores Managers were scolded for not keeping up with policy change even when provided with no clear explanation of how the policy would affect store operations, both on the day-to-day and long term. Quick implementation was expected with usually 2 days or less which was not enough time for most stores. This was a very regular occurrence and was causing store staff a lot of stress. Corporate’s communication system with the stores changed multiple times over the 5 years I worked there, and they rarely took the feedback of those actually in the stores, (staff, store managers and trainers), on how we felt they could better communicate with them.
Advice: None
Pros: Loved the people, very passionate The overall message of the company was wonderful. I felt that it aligned with many of my own values. I loved my employees, my upper management and as a trainer, I got to meet, learn from, and help, other store managers across the country

Advice: None
Pros: They host fun events for the employees

Cons: HR is horrible. Politics. Lack of transparency.
Advice: None
Pros: Entrepreneurial spirit/opportunity. Flexibility is great.

Cons: L’Oreal has a great marketing machine to sell its products and project itself as a great company to work for social responsibility and sustainability, but what happens inside on how they treat employees is horrendous. They have not done anything significant to improve the moral of the employees and only care about financial performance (including putting safety second). They know that’s why they have high employee turnover but rely in its established brand name to continue attracting, abusing then re-hiring employees. In my department I have not seen anyone leave the company in good turns, everyone leaves the company frustrated. In less than 5 years I have seen about 50 people come and go. Some managers shows competence and experience on the business and cares for the employees. What is unfortunate is that upper management does not care they cannot operate with the head count we have. We need more people. This limits managers to do everything they want to do.
Advice: I don't believe Pulse is anonymous.
Pros: Free products and flexible time

Cons: Silo’s in learning new skills. Interviewed for a new role, hiring manager told me she didn’t have time to train me.

Advice: None
Pros: Many teams = many resources

Cons: Managers do not care about workers
Advice: None
Pros: The culture is fun and welcoming

Cons: Health insurance is terrible, even with the highest coverage PPO plan. Costs have skyrocketed over the last couple of years the increases go well beyond any increases in salary - even with stellar performance. If there are issues with claims it takes hours on the phone over multiple sessions to get resolved. Expect to pay well above the deductible and out of pocket max since that only applies to what Anthem deems 'appropriate'.

Current employees are being compensated well below market value and there are no plans to reevaluate comp levels. Only new hires are coming in with competitive salaries and are compensated well above tenured employees.

We make a truly stunning amount of money for a very select group of people.

HR has far too much power over career mobility and the evaluation system they use to evaluate talent is opaque. If you get misclassified somewhere along the way you may not even be aware and it could take years to fix it.
Advice: Pay your people what they are worth. Go back to health plans that actually pay for health care, employees should not have to have a panic attack about how much a doctor's visit is going to cost before a visit even occurs.
Pros: You get to work alongside some of the most talented, passionate, and diverse people in the world!

L'Oreal is truly an organization that is committed to making the world a better place through all of their sustainability and DE&amp;I commitments.

Incredibly fast paced, highly competitive environment that is great for individuals that thrive with this type of energy. 

The highly matrixed environment can be a bit frustrating at times but generally creates much more powerful initiatives.

Cons: -Promotion process (depends on the performance of others, not just the employee) -Salary is lower than market value -HR tends to be MIA with concerns -High turn over in certain roles, so at times it difficult to keep momentum
Advice: None
Pros: -Generous PTO -Vacation Buy Program -Company Store -Opportunity to explore different roles throughout your career -At the forefront of innovation -Truly wants to make an impact on sustainability -Lots of benefits for parents

Cons: Moving up can be difficult if you're not pushing for it
Advice: None
Pros: Overall good people to work with

Cons: The mgmt teams do not support their staff. They expect you to know everything. Training is a constant issue that gets pushed off onto someone else. Mgmt doesn't own their mistakes. Will leave you hanging when pressured by their leaders.
Advice: Support your team so they can support the business. Your job isn't to be in my way when I'm working and adding unnecessary processes.
Pros: Benefits are good, 10+ company holidays, vacation days as soon as you start.

Cons: Micromanagement especially from the younger, inexperienced managers
Advice: Empower your employees more. Involve them more when it comes to decisions that impact what they do

 -Underlying implicit bias/judgement by management
 -Unethical and lack of diversity
-Gossiping coworkers and hostile environment
 -No room to grow in field sales office
 -Who report you for (and not to) is in charge of your growth in your role and in the company 
-High turnover (because nothing gets resolved) 
-Who you report for will blame everything on you, call you instead of email you to not have anything documented 
-Not psychologically safe 
-Not considered a corporate employee, therefore HR could care less 
-Cold and humid office
 -Gaslighting and narcissistic management 
-Entry level employees are treated like trash
-Management change after first 6 months (new management still new to role, while other analysts still report into senior management)
Advice: You know what the issues are and could have a 0% tolerance policy but do nothing. There is so much time and money wasted due to so much turnover, drain the swamp.
Pros: -Good systems -Top 4 account 
-Okay pay for the area (not the highest in the industry though)
 -Hybrid model (most people in RI office go in twice a week, so not too strict) 
-Health Insurance is expensive but good

Pros: This is a Great company.

Cons: Sometimes overwhelming, too much expectations from one person
Advice: None
Pros: Nice and creative work environment

Cons: Recent lower management changes have made this place an absolute nightmare. Nothing but hostility, and harassment. Our department admin as well as our HR department is never reachable, and have no clue who to go to for these issues. Many current employees actively looking elsewhere. Certainly a “pizza party” culture instead of addressing the issues.
Advice: None
Pros: No benefits are worth the stress

Cons: Politics internal, hard to get things approved
Advice: None
Pros: Free Products, nice people and room to grow

Cons: However, I did find out many things about L'Oréal. Even though the company states to be working on sustainability and has a lot of good press, 90% of its products contain orange plastics, and 77% of its products contain red plastics. Additionally, they still test on animals in countries like China and have operations in countries considered governed by oppressive regimes.
Advice: None
Pros: As a student researching wether L'Oreal really is sustainable, I can say the company is well organized, has a clear mission and vision statement, and has good values to make a good option for clients and other stakeholders.

Cons: Extremely corporate ladder climbing environment.
Advice: None
Pros: Stable once you are a full time employee

Cons: Not the most technical in career opportunities.
Advice: None

Cons: You have to travel from location to location. During event you will have to carry your set to the store alone, get a wagon!

Pros: Great job for work life balance! You receive consistent trainings to succeed.

Cons: unrealistic expectations around workload for certain roles
Advice: listen to employess
Pros: fair pay, good benefits , &amp; work life balance

Cons: Toxic culture. Co-workers would rather throw you under the bus to accelerate their careers than see you succeed. Micro management is rampant, all the while 'managing up' is seen as paramount versus managers cultivating / developing talent. TONS of nepotism and unfair treatment based on who you know rather than how hard you work and how competent you are.
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing company if you're willing to completely invest yourself in Beauty or have a passion for beauty that means you're willing to go ABOVE and beyond (i.e. work weekends, work until 8 pm). Great portfolio of brands. Always tons of incredibly smart and hard working people around you.

Cons: To much work, poor vacation days
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture and benefits. Friendly

Cons: intense work environment and lots of approvals
Advice: None
Pros: it was a lot of fun

Cons: Management is pretty hands off and it feels more like a temporary contract rather than developing soft skills. Location is not great either and facilities are in major need of renovation (in progress)
Advice: Definitely switch from 2, 1 year rotations to 3 8 month rotations. This would be a good way to fit everything in and it works for the cycles too.
Pros: Good Benefits and ability to move around in rotations to see different parts of the company.

Cons: Management needs work on all levels

Advice: None
Pros: Free gifts awesome gifts Great emphasis on Ethical company They care about wellbeing of Great events

Cons: They claim to be flexible and place importance on work life balance but the truth is you will have to work insane amounts of hours to be recognized and considered for promotions. Toxic behavior is rewarded. Good luck onboarding, it's either sink or swim. The role you're hired for never winds up being what is described. People don't stay in a role long enough to form relationships or bonds with their teams. If you express unhappiness, HR does not help you find a better fit within the company. If a senior leader doesn't like you, they'll block you from moving roles.
Advice: Stop rewarding terrible behavior by senior leaders.
Pros: Pay is good and so are the benefits.

Cons: Revolving door company, difficult personalities
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Benefits, culture, growth opportunities, challenging, fun

Cons: - Toxic politics that take up too much of your mental health. - Terrible onboarding process, you will be thrown in the deep end with no lifeline. - small tasks can take months to accomplish because of high level of bureaucracy - not much mobility you will have to leave the job to get a higher pay - really high turnover
Advice: If you want your teams to work faster remove the barriers for completing basic tasks. - Acknowledge employee work and support them to stop such a high turnover
Pros: Company store and free goods Nice office location in Manhattan Female empowered workforce

Cons: Long hours standing (up to 8 hours)

Pros: Quality of coworkers is high.

Cons: - Sometimes can be sink or swim environment and if you don't push yourself you won't be successful - Pay isn't the best in the industry, but you have a really amazing products that make a difference and are market leaders
Advice: There were some changes in leadership and younger and less experienced leaders came in that were too focused on the results and created lack of trust between employees and leaders.
Pros: + Huge network of coworkers who have a spirit of comradery + Seasoned leaders look out for their teams and foster an environment where you are always changing, learning, and growing + Expectations of leadership are super high, so you are always pushing yourself to do better and that's really satisfying

Cons: Mean girl-esque, lots of virtue signaling and not a lot of real action, easy to get overlooked if you're not the loudest, whitest person in the room, claims to be the most diverse but then doesn't have any programs in place to support diverse hires, two sides of the business: people who stay forever and people who immediately leave
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of parties and perks, opportunities to grow within the company, good enough work life balance at this level

Cons: Disheartening understanding that "clinically proven" really just means "a small group of study subjects believed they looked marginally better."
Advice: Quit greenwashing the company while making everything out of disposable plastics.
Pros: Amazing opportunity to scam the gullible public with dreams of youthful appearance.

Cons: Political, cut throat environment, May not be a fit for all
Advice: None
Pros: Largest beauty company in the world

Cons: Pay doesn’t increase by much beyond your initial hiring salary. Only way to make more is to be promoted, doesn’t matter if you simply become more skilled and efficient at your job. I’ve been told many times it’s not what you know it’s who you know, as far as getting promotions so if you aren’t good at politicking you may get stuck at a position. Peter principle is huge here.
Advice: Focus on rewarding your good employees regardless if you like or dislike their personalities
Pros: Good starting salary, large company with a lot of mobility laterally and vertically. Global company so it’s great if you are open to travel. Some great coworkers, good benefits, great work life balance.

Cons: Low salary, many employees lazy, leadership uninspiring...Overall not the best place to build a career
Advice: None

Cons: Nothing specific that I can share
Advice: None
Pros: Multinational company with different opportunities

Cons: Must be a self starter to succeed
Advice: None
Pros: The culture and ethics are excellent

Cons: Mgmt could be improved much
Advice: None
Pros: Fun and fast and frenetic

Cons: The high profit margins help paper over a lot of mistakes and stress, therefore no impetus on the part of the business for continuous improvement. Politics and appearances are tenfold more important than facts on the ground.
Advice: Heavily siloed into many departments, project management is atrocious since no one is able to bridge all those tiny kingdoms. No drive to improve on fundamentals, just chasing the latest marketing fads.
Pros: The high profit margins help paper over a lot of mistakes and stress, good people to work with.

Cons: Discriminative &amp; Toxic Senior Supervisor. Older generation, authoritarian senior manager who is not considerate to those with young kids, single working moms, those with learning disabilities and exhibits a certain distaste for some people of color. It's kept hush but many know this is the case and choose to tolerate it in fear of speaking up and losing their jobs. Be prepared to be micromanaged and if you resist, she will dismiss you. There's favoritism towards young candidates and who are willing to do anything to please and be available at a moments notice. There is no regard or patience for those who have younger kids, and if they become ill, (or come down with Covid), there will be no remorse or consideration. You may instead be served with "We are not a babysitting service." I know from personal experience when my 12 yr old had Covid and I had to work from home all week being I am a single parent. You'll be approached very fake and insincerely some days and others, you may get abruptly messaged for forgetting to change your status online from Break to Available for Calls and told your pay will be deducted. The Le Care staff themselves are wonderful ladies, however, you would need to be able to tolerate a toxic, discriminative, micro-manager. Performance metrics are not mentioned nor explained when onboarding. Over time, you figure it out if you take time on your own to see what each metric means. The performance metric that seems to matter most is cases per hour. Essentially that means getting the call or case down within a certain time is valued more than doing the cases CORRECTLY. If you're trained to be on the phones and handle e-commerce, be prepared for a constant technical and check-out nightmares. Functionality is sub par, Salesforce and computer systems in general are constantly glitching which slows speed down. Be prepared to manage frustrated customers complaining about their orders not going through or promo codes not working. The SOP's are unrealistic and very basic and barely help resolve unique issues. And if you ask, no one seems to know how to resolve it and are waiting for the brand to get back to them. The training provided can be overwhelming and 80% of the workload is e-commerce related which is not thoroughly covered in training. Therefore, there is a substantial amount of figuring things out on your own. This can be great for those who are resourceful and determined, however challenging for those who prefer step-by-step support and guidance. Senior manager has no patience or regard for those with learning disabilities like dyslexia, even if it's mentioned during your interview process. There have been a couple cases where I've witnessed people so stressed and upset to the point of tears because of how senior management approached them. Incivility is the norm. No concern for employee retention and morale though they talk the talk, yet don't walk the walk. No regard for high performers unless you're on senior manager's good side. Cannot ask too many questions or be "too" outspoken, otherwise you will be micro-managed to no end. NOTE: If you're "too good" at your job and look to excel in a higher position, there is a possibility of being held back from progressing to higher position within the department since senior supervisor must approve it and essentially, they need you and make their numbers look good. It's happened though it's kept silent and under radar. Temps are not given growth opportunities and are excluded from some departmental and company events, such as Christmas or other in-office parties. You will be asked to be on the phones or work until the end of day, even if the rest of the department was released to go home early. Overall, you're basically thrown into the ocean and left there to sink or swim. I would NOT recommend unless you need something for a very short time. Fair warning given.
Advice: Le Care is the front line to your consumers. There ought to be a supervisor who genuinely cares. Clean house of the narcissistic discriminative abuse.
Pros: This applies within the Le Care department. Great interdepartmental support and comradery among the staff. Staff are very pleasant and supportive when needed. Hybrid schedule

Cons: You do not need a Glassdoor review to know that L’Oreal is notorious for their toxic culture. There is a lack of openness to new ideas, limiting innovation and progression. Senior leadership is continuously preaching “group think” mentality. If you do not follow suit, brace yourself for some high-school passive aggressive retaliation. Do not waste your time working hard, only favoritism will get you where you want to go. Most importantly, say goodbye to your mental health.
Advice: Get rid of the stagnant tenured employees. It’s time to hire up and bring in external hires, who can put out valuable and actionable thought leadership and drive the change that L’Oreal needs from a business and culture perspective.
Pros: You get to say that you work at L’Oreal. It’s a pro when you think that holds some type of significance, but it means absolutely nothing.

Cons: career promotion salary is low
Advice: promote the right people that are more qualified and knowledgeable
Pros: benefits as perks and discounts vacation time

Cons: Turnover and closes are long days typically
Advice: None
Pros: Company size and exposure to different accounting topics

Cons: Growth isn’t always transparent, exceeded all expectations and was praised as key talent but they failed to promote me as initially promised after extended period. Those who had better advocates (on good terms/favorites of the bigger boss) got their promotion, despite some of them having been called out as underperforming
Advice: Audit the leadership (brand SVP and GM level) and if someone has issues and people complained about them (non stop), stop promoting them/allowing them to take key positions where they can hurt your talent..

Pros: Always a pleasure to work with the #1 company in the segment

Cons: Upper management can afford to undergo some serious bias training, and any person managing anybody should undergo more extensive training on how to be a positive force for change. It can be quite easy and frustrating to get bogged down by old-school corporate politics here, when everything would be so much better if a top-down perspective was implemented to figure out what the actual issues were.
Advice: None
Pros: Promotions are relatively quick (1-2 years depending on timing, network, etc.).

Advice: None
Pros: Pay is easy, compensation is generous and management is respectful.

Cons: pay was lacking a bit
Advice: None
Pros: great place to work. work life balance is good

Cons: The job itself is too much for one person especially if you just joined the company. Lack of SOPs, Lack of manpower, so one employee assigned what it seemed to be 3-4 people’s job. Worked more than 12 hours multiple times (no overtime since I’m salaried employee) to get training, to get familiarized with the products and their processes, and go over hundreds of emails, update all spreadsheets needed etc etc. Spent couple weekends working. There’s also one point I worked from 8:30 am to almost midnight just to finish the work but still can’t catch up. To the point I got sick (probably because lack of sleep focusing in catching up at work to make them happy). It’s not sustainable. Physical and Mental Health is very important too.
Advice: Clear procedure and proper training should be in place. Also, the employees are overworked and I believe that is one of the reason why an employee will leave.
Pros: Joined Loreal team year end of December 2021. Co-workers seems to be nice and very welcoming. They offer good benefits such as 401K, medical, dental, $ to spend on store every quarter and so on.

Cons: Could improve work / life balance

Advice: None
Pros: Industry leading benefits including pension, top-notch medical, free goods. The company is also industry leading in ESG initiatives.

Cons: Many newer people seem surprisingly over leveled. Meetings to the point of oblivion and redundance. Due to each function being well staffed with breadth and depth, it can feel like a lot of overlap of similar functions yet not speaking to each other, particularly those who are running the businesses themselves. Seems like it could lead to unnecessary burnout, being crippled with focusing on non urgent tasks at the cost of running the business.
Advice: Cut down on meetings and consolidate all the "centers" of excellence

Cons: I worked at the Piscataway plant on the night shift and it’s not worth it. They’re long shifts and while the work isn’t hard, you can’t get work done. The supply rooms are never stocked with what we need: wrap, cleaners, etc. Night shift always has to clean up after morning shift, anything they didn’t feel like doing. We do not have any mechanics on our shift really, so if something goes wrong you as a packaging operator are expected to fix it or you sit there for hours. The mechanics that we do have are burnt out and leaving or have told me they are planning to. So honestly, even though we desperately need mechanics, don’t Apply. They’ll mandate you every single day and expect you to look after all 3 production floors and all their machines. L’Oréal’s biggest emphasis is production and they will badger you if you don’t make that production, even though we literally can’t make production if we don’t have mechanics or supplies. To the point where they’ll make you take your break later so you can run someone else’s line through THEIR break just to get an extra 15 minutes of production. They watch the cameras all the time to make sure that you don’t eat, take too long of a break, or go on your phone. Understandable, but with supervisors doing their rounds every few minutes and a “team” that comes in the morning to shuffle through our trash to make sure we didn’t eat on the floor is excessive. On top of that you’re given 2 15 minute breaks and 1 20 minute. The walk to the break room / off the production floor is about 3-5 minutes. There goes half your break. On top of that, other departments will purposely trigger the gates to prevent you from navigating off the production floor, so you have to wait for the gates to close so you can keep walking. You can’t break in the offices with the couches, kurigs, and fridges with snacks in them though that are on the production floor because that’s not allowed. So you’re supposed to sit on your line and do nothing, because the lines are mostly automatic. You can’t clean the machine much, because well- they’re running. Don’t trust our union representatives. They tell EVERYTHING to their friends, because I’ve had someone come up to me and ask about a situation that happened with another coworker that the union guy had to be made aware of. When I asked how they knew, he said one of the union guys tell him everything. People come and go so much, the turnover rate is terrible. It makes training them pointless, which is another point. There needs to be *designated trainers*. You’ll train with a person that doesn’t care about training you or will show you all the wrong ways of running the line. You’ll either train on a line for 2 weeks or 2 hours before you’re expected to run it, no in between. My advice is ACT YOUR WAGE. Do not do the mechanic’s job to make your numbers. Don’t overextend yourself by working through break. Etc. Honestly, don’t be a hard worker. Hard workers have to pick up the slack of everyone else. You’re doing a good job and your expected to learn all these harder lines that always break down, because nobody else wants to. Apparently since we’re in a union, we’re all supposed to make the same, but why am I being told new hires are making $25? So don’t learn that harder line that nobody else wants to, because while you’re there putting in the effort and learning dozens of lines, someone else will just stay on one line for years because they refuse to go anywhere else. Who are they going to mandate when they need one of those lines run? You, not them. They only know one line. Mandating is a promise. If you’re new, you will get mandated every single weekend and if you’re on 3rd shift, you will have to stay 4 hours over everyday even though morning shift has way too many people. Your employee badge number also won’t work until you email HR about it. Meaning you can’t access the PPI, because it’s locked behind a vending machine that needs your ID. You also won’t get your health insurance deducted from your paychecks until you bring it up. The best is needing to check every single paycheck that comes in, because payroll WILL forget to pay you for some days. We have no time off. You get 2 days for the whole year. I’ve been told we had to choose between having our BY LAW 5 sick days or a Christmas bonus. Apparently we chose the Christmas bonus. So we don’t have the legal requirement of 5 sick days. And the Christmas bonus is only $15. Good job. So don’t expect to ever go on vacation or be sick, because that’s not allowed. Don’t bother applying here unless it’s an office job or something off of the production floor. It’s not worth the stress and when I’m not working, I’m sleeping. I have no life now because of this place.

Pros: Half off products, benefits, time off and holiday.

Cons: Company is very French and the culture can be demanding depending on the team. During COVID were one of the first companies to mandate a return to office - not a great response in my opinion.

Advice: None
Pros: Experience and on job training

Cons: Initially was a nice place to work, until I saw the dark side of the business. For a company that makes products for women, they sure treat many women terribly. Especially women who have years of experience. I witnessed so many quality employees get treated like garbage, and eventually they bring in young people who they work into the ground. It is all about the perception, who can show off more. There are also very toxic people and teams, reminded me of high school mean girls. Get ready to work 24/7 and it still won't be enough. Beware!

Cons: Loreal is a great marketing company with a general idea of trying to become a supply chain leader. Issue is, their current supply chain infrastructure, leadership knowledge, and overall capabilities are 20 years behind the rest of the CPG world. Culture is like start up and it's shoot first and aiming is option. Very reactive overall, and ditch to ditch month to month because they only see short term tactical and cash flow impacts. It's always a weekly or monthly fire drill. Long term strategy and planning is not extinct at Loreal, it never evolved. During my time with the company, the supply chain organization completely round tripped in a matter of around 3 years and spent the last two regressing. Leadership is too involved in day to day activities to form an idea of what they need to do long run. Leadership also has no clue how to execute at the account level and do not know what questions to even ask during an interview to determine whether someone will add value. I could give a random person some key words to say in an interview with leadership over 20 minutes or so and they could likely get an offer. Mundane tasks go through leadership. Little empowerment to execute using your own experience. Leadership diminishes roles so they can be the decision maker, own a lower level customer relationship, and prop up their resume. Leadership also very stubborn to admit what they don't know and do not listen to experienced professionals. Very siloed organization that is sales role heavy. Need to trim significant head count there to balance the organization better and bring in needed supply chain knowledgeable people. Career opportunities in the corporate office are funneled to the east coast. Very limited field sales/remote locations. If you are an experienced supply chain professional, you tackle issues that were things in 2005. You aren't going to learn any new, future oriented, next ways of working. Working for Loreal in a supply chain capacity is a good way to regress your existing experience and resume. In no way would I refer a friend or industry peer to join Loreal supply chain. Loreal will always prioritize other areas and supply chain is a career dead end cycle. The best way to show your value to Loreal is to leave.
Advice: Honestly reassess whether the organization is really wants to prioritize anything more than marketing and sales. You think you have serious aspirations to be an industry leader but you're only will to put forth occasional hobby type of effort. Try listening to experienced people that deal in both tactical and strategic execution so you can learn new ways of working. Otherwise, you completely limit very sharp people and open the door for them to leave. Lastly, work on improving inclusion as it relates to employees that have children; particularly new mothers.
Pros: Good benefits, summer hours, flex hours, hybrid work, company store w/ quarterly free goods allowance, good people. Good place to work as a first job out of college to get experience for two year. Also a good place to work if you're approaching retirement. Not a good place if you're anywhere in between those two goal posts.

Cons: only advance when you have support
Advice: equal opportunity
Pros: various opportunities. there are numerous role options

Cons: Salary is sub-par for the amount of work expected. Company says they want employees to have some type of work/life balance (don't work too much past 5:30 pm, take your days off, including company holidays, weekends, etc.). There are no allowances for days off, because you have to meet goals set for each month, regardless... This does not allow one to actually enjoy PTO and vacation, because you end up working anyway so you don't fall behind, which makes having paid time off pointless to some degree. You have to take it because if you don't use it. You lose it.

Cons: There's a lot of turnover. Expect to leave after a maximum of 3 years. The Process Engineer team goes through several iterations as they are constantly overworked. Tried to go from contractor to full-time. It actually took forever after the interview and didn't hear anything back until I told them I got another job offer. HR was most likely holding up the interview process. After trying to do the job of two people there(they fired someone and we were expected to operate everything like normal. There wasn't any urgency trying to hire someone for sure though) I was getting burnt out and work-life balance was heavily affected.

Personally, it wasn’t my strong suit. Future growth starting from that tile was unclear, and at best, could take years

Cons: Worked at L’Oreal for almost five years. Annual raise was only ever 1% even if my performance review was excellent. I got promoted for exceeding expectations and only received a $2,000 raise for the year. I was given vacation days under the table without HR knowing (which I couldn’t take without serious impact on my performance due to workload) to make up for the lack of compensation and no bonus. I was paid 30% less than the average employee joining the company with my equivalent title. You need to negotiate a lot before you join the organization because that’s the only chance you’ll get. Each year I worked there I felt less and less valued and was making progressively less than my market value. I raised this every quarter and was met with no response and was gaslit by my managers who pretended they didn’t know anything about the compensation of their other direct reports which is blatant BS. When I quit my job it was posted as Manager on LinkedIn. This was the title I had made a strong case for in all my performance reviews and was asked to hang tight for. You will work yourself into a shell of a human and leave old, exhausted, and full of regret over the opportunities missed while hanging onto empty promises. After years of this I lost my will to put in any effort and this sentiment rolled into my personal life as well, unfortunately. 

Leadership are often L’Oreal babies who spent their entire 20+ year careers leeching the company and have zero emotional intelligence. My manager spent her days micromanaging me, berating me on group calls in front of my peers, and asking me to perform tasks that were not possible within our systems nor ethical. I would often get calls at the end of the day and sometimes in the middle of the night that would drag on for hours of listening to whining and trickle down anxiety. These calls would require that I cancel my personal commitments at 7-8pm+ at the last minute regularly. I started my day early and always made to see to have my work done so this was unnecessary. My management did not respect my time and the pressure on middle managers from higher up was interfering on our productivity when it resulted in these waste of time anxiety ridden calls. The direction was unclear as priorities shifted multiple times a day in order to appease everyone but yet no one at all. Eventually I lost the will to keep up with the ever changing requirements and realized I was working toward nothing. I worked two jobs for six months when someone left my team. I was working day and night throughout this time and never got a thank you. All it did was destroy my credibility among my peers as I was trying to do more than the hours in a day would permit. This company will cost you your self esteem and happiness. They treat everyone as replaceable because they have plenty of candidates looking for name recognition on their resume so you will be vastly underpaid and under appreciated the entire time.
Advice: If you see that you have analysts and managers who are miserable, take notice of their leadership. You will often find that these leaders have a track record of dissolving teams and hopping around the organization.

Pros: - wonderful work environment
- kind, helpful people

Cons: *You have to walk on eggshells due to the nature of studies. They didn't know what they wanted. they needed a data scientist but didn't seem to want to pay for want, hence got a study operator instead. slightly underpaid. The establishment is mostly women. which isn't a bad thing, but it made everything extremely mundane and hard to make interpersonal relationships because of the high regard for professionalism. Not a place to be oneself, but definitely a place to just collect a check

Cons: Culture of managing up - too many people hiding in meetings and making decks not working on problem solving and revenue
Advice: Most are great but listen to all levels of employee.
Pros: People culture and the Benefits
Opportunities and growth
Diverse work and people

Cons: Can get competitive, dealing with customers, not commissions based
Advice: Add commissions for vendors
Pros: Handoffs management, Great coworkers, easy to sell products

Cons: Lack of future direction. French Management that was harsh or unrealistic on expectations. Because of this, different managers were stressed out. You’re working around the clock because the work doesn’t stop. Poor training, so there really left huge gray areas on what topics needed to be mastered before taking on product management. Too many manual processes with no SOP, so relying on someone’s expertise was the only way to understand something. Suppliers hated the acquisitions that they take on because of ridiculous standards. Too many acquisitions in a short time period so no one gets fully adjusted. Lies that no one’s jobs are at stake but they very much fire people more than they liked to admit. This also contributed to Management’s level of stress with high turnover, and no respect for employees with personal issues. Was never given the opportunity to utilize my Vacation days. Need to make a full personality assessment on all individuals because there were some people that were very difficult to work with unless you escalated.
Advice: Treat employees with dignity and respect. Stop lying to the masses in regards to job security then go back on your word. Start adopting some American principles if this is going to reside in USA. Create a formal onboarding program with job specific training on tools and processes. Break status quo around areas “it’s-always-been-done-that-way”. Start fully assessing if certain individuals are truly competent to lead in roles that decipher the career of others. Need better HR alignment and implement new advocates to be the voice of the workplace
Pros: Great pay. Travel opportunity but only if you’re in a certain division. Free products. Use a working day to give back to the community company wide.

Cons: - A lot of meetings
- Old/outdated processes
Advice: None
Pros: - Entrepreneurship Spirit
- Collaboration &amp; Partnership 
- Focus on result 
- A lot of learning and upskilling

Cons: Politics are miserable. Very cut throat atmosphere. One in which managers are forced to point fingers instead of solving problems.
They are a marketing company first and a manufacturer 2nd. Sell yourself and you can go far.
Advice: None

Cons: Busy place to work for
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Love the people I have been able to connect with

Cons: Compensation, Environment, Growth, Rigidity, Toxic
Advice: None
Pros: Job stability, Perks, Benefits ,Hours, Product

Cons: Disorganized, backstabbing workplace, siloed and a place where bad behavior and evilness is rewarded.
Advice: Stop rewardind evil people in Operations . Promoting the worst Leadership Behaviors in the organization as SVPs is a slap in the face in the entire organization. It really shows L’Oreal doesn’t care about human beings.
Pros: Free Goods
Quality of Products

Cons: it is a very demanding work load. the systems are overwhelming. it's very political.  it's not always a meritocracy but a lot how well connected you are.  being french is a big help. there are endless meetings and updates for french management that arrives almost monthly and that adds more work to an already demanding load.  simple things are made difficult and sometimes you are made to strategize 50 programs for a brand and only 4 or 5 get done due to timing and costs.  there are a lot of long and very arduous meetings and too many emails with entire departments cc'ed that may not be relevant to your daily work and this is even more time consuming.
Advice: turnover should be looked at.  sometimes entire departments turn over and no one looks at the head of the brand or at the leadership.   promotions are not always given to the hardest worker or the most talented person but to favorites.  management should be aware that after working a 9 to 8pm day, people are home are still at work late into the night and when you wake up --- you are inundated with another 100 emails.
Pros: it is a generous employer and they give you every benefit under the sun.
the work is interesting as are the products and the people are brilliant.
the brands are amazing and the development pipeline impressive. you get to work with many people cross functionally and there is a lot of room to move around l'oreal if you are good and you start there young.

Cons: No cons noticed in the compagny
Advice: None
Pros: Ethics - Competitiveness - environement - Digital

Cons: outdated company policies - want us in office 3 days a qeek
Advice: None
Pros: lucky to have a good team but the company needs to get with the times

Cons: Chaotic organization with unbelievable amount of politics, gossip, and backstabbing. It is shocking how inappropriate some unfavored employees are treated. Watch your back because you never know when they will turn on you and you'll have no idea why things changed so suddenly.
Advice: None
Pros: No, not at this time

Cons: Fast paced environment takes time to acclimate
Advice: None
Pros: High visibility and access to senior leadership

Cons: Benefits and compensation package is below expectation
Advice: None
Pros: Learning on the job and high skilled professionals network

Cons: Passion to help fix holes in routines established there seems to really threaten management.  Poor communication and direction from boss to direct reports. Indecisive back and forth decision-making and vague instruction without real strategy considered leaves you having to choose between kissing up to boss or doing your best at the job. A large amount of responsibility without the power to make decisions to set yourself up in those responsibilities. I was thrown under the bus taking blame for my boss' decisions quite a few times. Passive aggressive type leadership. Will terminate you without stating a reason. My job description changed completely from accepting job to where I ended up, without my position title changing. Unspoken expectation to "live" there in order to get things done, despite a couple break-ins making location late at night unsafe.
Advice: "because it's always worked out/been done this way" is not a reason to continue doing something a certain way. The more efficiently a set up can be, the more efficiently many tasks can be done to create a large amount of time to do extra projects and take a business (and my strengths/weaknesses) way beyond where it is. Also, employees who are passionate are not a threat, but should inspire you. I have never cared so much about a position in my life and felt punished for speaking up about real concerns and obstacles.
Pros: The job itself has very fun responsibilities, good benefits, around average/ slightly below average pay, fun culture at shows, events and meetings, indirect inspirational type of leadership overall expressed frequently through posted quotes, perks, thank you meals etc,( I'd still want the job back more than anything if under different leadership)

Cons: Underpaid and not willing to do anything about it.
Advice: Pay your employees fairly to avoid turnover.
Pros: Great team - great benefits

Cons: Upper Management and lack of leadership.
Advice: None
Pros: Good morale, easy collaboration with teams.

Advice: None
Pros: pension, free goods, fun place to work, easy work, fun culture

Cons: L'Oreal suffers from an old fashioned management style (top down).  There is a general sense of management by fear, especially among the French hierarchy.  And, there are several very important "functions" that dominate: labs and marketing being the two main ones. Sales, HR and Education are typically under-regarded -- although that depends on the country to some degree.

If you are not French, there are reduced opportunities.  There is a poor level of diversity in top management in general.  

The company is underequipped in Information Technologies -- and it is lagging heavily in the internet activities.  It has barely achieved a web 1.0 mentality.
Advice: Learn to listen (to employees and customers), let go (of the control).  Learn how to say "no" in order to bring in real change in the way we do business.
Pros: Great R&D.  If you are in marketing, greater opportunities generally.  With such a large pool of people, you are always bound to find some great people.  Certainly for the fortunate, there can be quick promotions and expatriation.  The cosmetics industry is generally recession resistant -- so there's a net on the downside.  The company has shown great growth over the past 20 years and with the need for growth, one can expect further acquisitions which will lead to even more opportunities.  L'Oreal is a recognized leader -- and is typically a great school for marketing and sales... There are five divisions and a very handsome portfolio of brands to work in which can provide a good deal of diversity in the jobs.  The benefits (at least in France) are very good.

Cons: Overworked, top-down management style, abrasive culture.
Advice: Need to address major resource/personnel issue. Cannot expect employees to take on additional work and produce same high level of results.
Pros: Good pay, industry leader, fast paced environment that sets you up for success in the industry.

Cons: very competitive environment, not many opportunities for career evolution, very french minded environment, low salaries
Advice: None
Pros: diverse mentality, openminded, modern and updated environment, focus on training and follows even creates trends. a great school for media spending business, e-commerce and product marketing career

Cons: Things are constantly changing. If you are going to work for a company that has stayed relevant and always topped the industry in innovation, you need to be comfortable with this. At times, it can be frustrating to work on an initiative to have it scrapped because of different initiatives, but it is part of the big picture with L'Oreal.
Advice: Continue to value hard work and strong principles. Look at a better compensation structure that is not solely focused around previous compensation and rather the requirements of the role and where the role fits in relation to other roles and compensation structures.
Pros: The organization really values your touch bases and check ins with your progress. You can truly own your destiny. I started out as an assistant store manager in a small retail division and am now, 5 years later, working my way onto a corporate management role with our Professional Products Division. Work hard, be a good person, and own your progress... It's all part of the entrepreneurial spirit of L'Oreal.

Cons: Lower pay than my peers at other companies but getting better exposure.
Advice: None
Pros: Gaining a great experience so far, learning a lot

Cons: There is no culture here. The people they hired for management are lazy, clueless and unsupportive. New employees training is a joke. On top of that, they’re cheap when it comes to paying their employees. Salaries for staff are definitely below the market rate. And they wonder why people are quitting left and right. For all reasons above.
Advice: None
Pros: Company Free goods is nice

Cons: Company can be political at times
Advice: None
Pros: Great marketing exposure and experience.

Advice: None
Pros: Great co workers and friendly environment. Amazing work life balance

Cons: no recognition by upper management
Advice: None
Pros: You get to put loreal on your resume

Cons: Very little training given. If you're not already somewhat familiar with the line of work there's very little they'll do for you.
Advice: I see a lot of nepotism going on and not enough attention to employees who are great at the job despite "knowing someone"
Pros: Simple work and friendly environment.

Cons: I haven’t had the bad experiences that everyone else seems to have had, but I hear you and I hope it changes
Advice: None
Pros: If you get a good team at L’Oréal with a good manager who respects boundaries, then you’ll be set.

Cons: Unorganized company. Horrible Management. HR should create standardized training for all positions... But that doesn't happen. Manipulative and unfair management where everyone is not treated the same. Lack of true diversity. Horrible culture. Just recently became "sales driven". With all the technology out there, this company is in the deep Stone Age. Resources are scarce. Employees on lower levels are not respected and excluded from a lot. No recognition if you're mid-level management. Have you seen the movie "Mean Girls?" Well, those exist at this company. Lots of sweet valley high cliques. Oh, and don't expect your manager or anyone to be honest with you about anything. They'll just talk behind your back on a separate conference call, then accuse you of something WITHOUT asking your side. Very unprofessional, caddy, manipulate and unethical company. Zero development. If you're not a favorite, you'll be excluded from everything.
Advice: HR... When a complaint is brought to your attention, make the employee feel like you're listening. Change the culture by appreciating your employees more and having honest conversations. Try developing someone for once! Recognize every level for their hard work. Send Happy holidays, birthday or work anniversary cards to your people.  Create more resources to win and ensure every new employee is welcomed and thoroughly trained. So many jobs overlap and it appears to be unorganized because three people are all doing the same job description. Make all descriptions CLEAR and FOCUSED so that never occurs. Give your employees more than $25 ($30 at expensive places like NY, Vegas, LA... OOOH $5 extra dollars) to eat on dinner when you make them travel and leave their families. Be FAIR and treat people the way you want to be treated.
Pros: Competitive Pay, great benefits, travel, and flexible hours.

Cons: Not much but one two three
Advice: None
Pros: W/l balance is very good

Cons: •can be tone deaf to DEI 
•some arrogance through hierarchical structure
Advice: None
Pros: •fast pace forces you to learn quicker and be more nimble/agile
•Great company for recent graduates

Cons: No work life balance and little support to accomplish a tremendous amount of work.  It's difficult to fill junior level positions and retain talent.  There is also a lot of nepotism in the company and the "french connection" where french employees are given better perks, benefits and opportunities than their american counterparts. 

The biggest issue is the one year non-compete.  The company cannot retain people because of the hours and work environment  Their latest solution to employee turnover is to force everyone to sign a 1 year non compete.  If you don't sign, the company terminates you.   Going forward, ANY EMPLOYEE AT ANY LEVEL WILL BE REQUIRED TO SIGN to join the organization.  

The morale is so low as a result, I am concerned about the future of the organization.  People feel like indentured servants because no one will even interview them with a 1 year non compete.  It's really sad.  I used to love this company.
Advice: I think he is out of touch with the employees and demonstrates no interest in the talented people in his organization.  His lack of ability to understand what motivates people (or lack of caring) is leading the company into dangerous territory.
Pros: Talented people, challenging projects and work, good opportunities for advancement (very quickly) and great benefits.  This is one of the few companies I have worked for that is focused on career development at all levels.

Cons: Low pay for all employees
Advice: None
Pros: Consistent schedule
Easily accessible management
Work from home friendly

Cons: Corporate personnel treated better than plant personnel.  i.e. the corporate summer hours were better than plant summer hours.  It also appeared that career progression was better if you were in corporate instead of the plant.  Extremely long hours, work-life balance was non-existent in plants.  French management often had unrealistic expectations and little respect for the fact that we were in the US and not France.  Newly hired college graduates were hired and moved into positions where they managed employees who had been with the company for years and the long term employees had to train the new managers.  The graduates were then promoted and the long term employees had to train the next new graduate hired.  It was an endless cycle.  Raises were minimal 1-2% and they didn't keep up with the industry.
Advice: Provide recently promoted managers with management training.  Don't just throw the new manager in and expect them to sink or swim.  Also, just because someone attended certain universities (i.e. Cornell, Lehigh) that does not ensure they will be a great employee; look into the talent pool you have already.  Many employees are overlooked due to political reasons. L'Oreal has a wonderful talent pool that should be utilized.
Pros: Learned a lot about the cosmetic and fragrance manufacturing industry.   Benefits were very good (health, dental, 401K and company store).  I was able to work my way from a clerk to senior manager in those years. I obtained extensive business knowledge during my time with L'Oreal and would work there again if the opportunity ever arose.

Cons: Very high workload and extremely manual processes. Scripting in SAP isn't allowed. My manager called a V-lookup that I had build into a spreadsheet a "short cut". Super antiquated processes. They are a gigantic company so making any changes or process improvements is a challenge. 

It's a competitive and backstabbing environment.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay and benefits. Nice discount in employee store. WFH flexibility. It can be alluring to have a major CPG company on your resume. Lots of smart people around you.

Cons: Loreal can have a toxic culture
Advice: None
Pros: Decent pay and benefits are good

Cons: Political and unfair; employees have different standards
Advice: None
Pros: Stable, challenging, exciting, great teammates

Cons: Too many layers of management to make decisions
Advice: Listen to teams more and support more
Pros: Overall, it was a good place. A lot of independence and autonomy.

Cons: It's a slave culture, the breaks are extremely short because the lunch room is so far from the working area. The H.R is completely uninvolved in matters of dispute. Their investigation process is deplorable and bias. They have a neglectful nature when it comes to the needs of their operators. They investigate pretty good when it involves their product not their people.
Advice: Third party deviation needs to be strongly enforced.
Pros: The 401k pension and other benefits are great.

Cons: Because of the fast moving and entrepreneurial approach to work, there is little in the way of set processes that a person can follow.  Getting started here can be overwhelming until you  build your own network of experts and helpers.     I don't know if it is the whole company or just the  area I am in but managing workload and priorities is not done well.   This is a work in progress as it is a recognized problem but it is hard to enforce processes in a culture that has always been fueled on individualistic influence.    Finding the balance between execution on inspired ideas and working on the highest priorities is a tough job.
Advice: Our company ethics are an inspiration in these times of eroding social responsibility.    Keep  going!  We really do have to get better at prioritizing work especially balancing between the various divisions.   Shared service groups are overwhelmed by the competing demands of the divisions and functions.
Pros: Fast and challenging  environment, it is never boring or mundane.  The company's social responsibility is a thing of pride to all of us and they do really take care of their employees in terms of benefits and job security.   For people who love an unstructured work approach and are OK with managing their own time, it is a great place.   I genuinely love this company.   There are no corporate drones here, individuals are appreciated and the company culture allows for different personalities and styles.

Cons: Pay not be as competitive
Advice: None
Pros: Opportunities for movement and gaining other experience

Cons: It’s who u know to get all the free products

Pros: Great face paced industry, beauty is always exciting and new!

Cons: Lack of opportunity to develop.
Minimum pay.
Advice: None
Pros: Discount employees benefit is great. 
Free trying new products.
Not highly competition.

Cons: Working around the clock nonstop, toxic abusive culture, unrealistic goals, complete lack of development plan and opportunities. Promotions based fully on favortism and not work ethic and output. Projects are piled on with no sense of work/life balance. French team constantly treats the US team like crap - the men in particular talk down to the women like complete trash with inappropriate comments, tone and language including referring to grown women as "girls" in a dismissive demeaning manor. Constant bullying mentality brushed off as "French culture". 

No regard for mental health. You could scream you are stressed and overworked and nobody including HR listens. People in my department have had to fight to take medical leave due to the stressful and damaging environment. 

Forced employees back into the office in 2020 during the heat of the pandemic - had to show proof of medicial records to get an extension to continue working from home. Masks are required and numbers spiking again, yet come September up to full capacity only 3 feet apart entire team in office at once. 

Company is NOT flexing with the new times and ways of working. No respect for people with desk jobs able to work from home efficiently and successfully. A mass exodus has occurred with 7 people leaving my department alone in the last few months.
Advice: Get with the times L'Oreal. You treat women like they are second to the men, you force bodies in during a pandemic, you have no regard for mental health or work/life balance.  Disgusting place to work and culture.
Pros: Company store discounts
Summer Fridays (which are being retracted come fall)

Pros: Pretty good and pretty fun

Cons: Everything was cut throat and awful .

Cons: Like most big corporations, you need to know how to weave in between politics
Advice: None
Pros: Learning is life here and you always grow

Cons: Large organization can be difficult to navigate. A lot of change and fast pace.
Advice: None
Pros: Always trying to do the right thing for employees. Great COVID procedures to keep employees safe. Good pay &amp; benefits. Free product.

Cons: The main problem is lack of work/life balance. Like I said if you are just getting started it works since you have the opportunities to go far. But later on, putting in late nights all the time, weekend work and working through vacations gets old. Especially when even that doesn't let you catch up because there's more piling on with no end in sight. A lot of it is unnecessary too. Meetings, meeting prep, slides that are never used etc. Thats the life here so if you like having a life outside I wouldn't work here. Not for long anyway.
Advice: Find a way to make work more efficient. Start 360 reviews because there are Managers taking full credit for the work of the lower employees and interns who they work to the bone. There is no proper way to alert higher up teams about this kind of behavior. Finally, hire more people. Invest more in Digital. Teams are strapped and exhausted.
Pros: Great brands, opportunities to work on exciting projects and for the most part good groups of people to work with. You can tell everyone cares about the job and how the brands do. The company does a great job of inspiring you. Its a particularly great place if you're getting started in your career. If you're a hard worker that knows how to showcase your talent, you will get far. Also great benefits and pay which they have to provide since the expected hours are so long. Overall a great place for starting out or for people who enjoy that your main focus in life is your job.

Cons: Because it's a consumer driven company, shift changes can happen migrating from a 5 day, 8hr shift to a rotating 12hr shift(employee basically works 50% of the year)

Cons: Unless you are French, handpicked by " a friend of an HR employee”, referred by a person who is a friend with HR or you’ve been picked  by “HR” to be in the “Management  Training Program “ (AKA “We can mold you into what we want”, and do not mind being a puppet)You will not matter!!!!!
 
*There seems to be secret unwritten rule that if you are an AVP or above (possibly a Director…depending if you’re a “ friend of HR”) you’ll never be fired from the company . You are an…. “untouchable”… REGARDLESS of any of the following:

Indiscretions, 
Obvious preferential treatment or favoritism, 
Taking no responsibility for mistakes made , only passing them off as other’s mistakes
Not providing direct reports with proper or sufficient direction on projects,  (which if given proper direction the above-mentioned point may not occur)
Lack of people skills, which is reminiscent of the Devil Wear’s Prada
Horrible time management skills, yet never an issue….
Direct reports work there as* off and have the “boss” taking all the praise and credit
Long hours with ZERO appreciation

If you have a voice, an opinion or a backbone....You will not be taken care off.
Advice: "Take care of your customers and employees and the profits will follow!!"

Start hiring executives that are real PEOPLE. People who are not robots!  Who are not opportunistic, self serving egomaniacs!! Who not threatened by seeing their direct reports flourish and grow!!

Get a more Human And Resourceful team of HR professionals.....
Pros: Free products monthly for the little people. Yearly allowance for the *untouchables
Great products
Great to have on your resume

Cons: It is a very political plant. They are really into favoritism. Management never seek to hear things from the employees point and how things work, they just expect you to get it done by X amount of time. Since acquired by L'Oreal, they have very strict rules on everything. They will not hire contract employees full time unless there is an open full-time position, but they don't have many positions available it is very little. Management along with HR don't really care too much about what the employees have to say or they don't really take care of their employees. They lack communication. They tell you there is always opportunities to grow in the business, but they tell you that to keep you around.
Advice: 1. You don't always know what you're talking about unless you experience it yourself on the floor.
2. Take employees voice into consideration and not just think about how management wants it.
3. Having employees be the eyes on other employees to get them in trouble is very unprofessional.
4. Communicate more with employees, not just who you are close with.
5. Give credits to those who deserve it. Don't take all the credit for what your employees have worked hard for.
Pros: It is very flexible. It was acquired by L'Oreal so we have Good benefit package. 401K, pension plan, medical, dental vision, and so forth. It is a bigger company now so other L'Oreal workers mainly gets hired onto Clarisonic. The pay is fair once you get hired on full-time.

Cons: Had to work long hours, customers can be a lot to work with
Advice: Listen to your employees and do not micro-manage
Pros: Cares about their employees and treat with respect

Cons: I can't think of any cons off the top of my head.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work environment, co-workers very helpful.

Cons: Can’t think of none now
Advice: None
Pros: Great work life balance, growth opportunities

Cons: The Decision Making Process Overall
Advice: None

Cons: Work Life Balance
Boring Office
Pressure

Cafeteria
Noise due to Warehouse
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits 
Pay
Work Life Balance
Culture
Opportunity for Growth

Cons: Sweat shop, toxic culture, sad
Advice: None
Pros: Free product, nice office, business strategy

Cons: Not enough overtime as desired.
Advice: None
Pros: Pay and time off is good.

Cons: Excessively long hours, due to antiquated processes.  Upper management throws tantrums, and ignores people if they made a mistake,  Other employees stand offish, and just let you flail around if you are not sure how to do something. All people coming in are engineering majors so materials management is being handled like the building of a rocket, which ties materials hands to move quickly and respond to marketing's needs.  All tasks are cumbersome and over analyzed.  For every one result, there is about 15 tasks and 4 people involved, again slows down the ability and agility to respond quickly to get results for the customer.
Advice: It would be helpful to hire college interns that are material management majors, not engineering majors.  The operations group needs to also be managed by experienced Operational people, not an engineering major who happened to over see a group of planners while closing down a plant.
Pros: they are good to their employee's as far as benefits, they do a lot of outside training, that is more culture training, which is nice they do,   But when you get back to work, no one follows that training, so it eventually becomes a waste of time. .  They also let  you get involved in volunteering and giving back to the community. 
  Their Human resource group is top notch, and very qood at what they do,  Their manager actually  sticks up for her group, so they are not afraid to learn and make mistakes. .

Cons: Limited opportunities and drama things.
Advice: None
Pros: Great WLB and benefits! Nice working place and colleagues.

Cons: Dont have any cons great working space
Advice: None
Pros: Friendly working space great people there

Pros: Good pay
Cute office 
Nice food in office
Great events, networking
Great for resume

Cons: Unrealistic Expectations in Some Areas
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits, Individual People, Global View

Cons: There are no cons to report
Advice: None
Pros: L'Oreal values their employees and prioritizes their professional career development

Cons: Bad Management
Long close hours
No Growth
Advice: None
Pros: Flex hours (summer hours)
Pizza
Company Outings

Cons: Downside is, the work "can" get very routine.  But I think that will depend on your ability and desire to learn "formulation" so you can get creative as you build up your skills in cosmetic chemistry and science.

And as you go up in ranks, it seems (from my brief observation) that you have to do a lot of good negotiation and discussion with marketing, whom typically will decide what products will be made.  This can be tough, because marketing folks are very tough.  =)
Advice: This is probably the same issue anywhere you go, but sometimes the ideas that come from internal members get "passed or ignored" where as ideas from outside seem to get more attention.
Pros: Best part is, you get to see the product you've worked on get launched into the market pretty much within 1~1.5 years from the point you start working on it.  THAT is an amazing gratification you get when working here, something not many of my friends in other industries can say (i.e. - semiconductor takes many years, pharma takes MANY years).

Another great part is, I have seem plenty of coworker friends who had a chance to work 1~3 years in other R&D locations around the world.  For L'Oreal, I have seem personal friends whom have worked at Clichy (France), Shanghai (China), and Kawasaki (Japan), but I believe there may be other locations as well.  How cool is that?  ^^

Cons: Super hierarchical, you cannot get anything done unless it is approved by bunch of managers. Lack of upward mobility, HR drives your career without consulting with you so if you are not careful you can end up in a mouse trap. No recognition for technical people, if you dont aspire to be a manager you are seen as a looser. No collaboration between groups makes projects move very slow. In the labs all the techs are temps so there is no continuity in terms of support, if you are working on something very delicate you have ot be prepared to do al the dirty work or waste months every year re-training new temps. Cost cutting is extreme so if you have to travel you have very small allowances and the cheapest flights so even if you are willing to pay out of pocket for an upgrade the fare does not allow it
Advice: Stop being so French hierarchy style, promote collaboration and stop having so many meetings, people are only functioning around big meetings not for the sake of project's objecives.
Strengthen the technical track, give credit to project managers, dont make them be people managers too, some people are good managing people and deserve the credit for it but handling projects is a different beast.
Pros: The company is loyal to its employees, good training opportunities, interesting projects, good benefits

Cons: Culture can be toxic. Complete lack of formal training, no motivation from superiors. Did not feel like I could grow there at all.
Advice: None
Pros: Product perks, nice office, interesting people

Cons: Tough to keep up with challenges of changing beauty industry
Advice: More progressive thinking
Pros: Generous PTO - long established company and brand

Cons: none that i can think of

Pros: I have always had great leaders. The industry is constantly changing therefore the role is exciting. Amazing benefits.

Advice: None
Pros: Love the way of working and collages here in L'Oreal!

Advice: None
Pros: pay ,hours,worl load had a lot of teamwork

Cons: Diversity 
Boring- Work can be very mundane and at time I dont want to leave home
Advice: None
Pros: Great starting salary 
Cross-functional communication 
Company culture
two days WFH

Cons: Pay could be a little better.
Advice: None
Pros: Management culture has been top tier.

Cons: L'Oreal has thrived all these years with great people. However, in this digital age it's time to balance it out with better systems and tools.  Too manual for a company this size.
Advice: Seeing a lot of positive change in work flexibility with the renovations at The Hub.  It is crucial we continue to find flexible work options across all LUSA locations to not only compete but go beyond our competition.
Pros: L'Oreal USA is not for everyone. Let me start with that... But if you enjoy working in an environment that is passionate about winning and where you can bring any idea to the table then this company is for you.  Now the challenge is how you get it done....just like anywhere else.  But L'Oreal is not an overly process driven company overall.  What I love is that you can create your own and there are great people who are willing to help.  This company truly embraces diversity and inclusion.  No one size fits all model here.

Cons: extremely politic, very difficult to grow/move up the ladder, management doesn't care about employees (highest turn-over rate in the R&I).  The R&I in Clark, NJ is a place that plays politics everyday.  Don't get me wrong, everywhere you go is involving politics.  But it is wrong if management doesn't care and play a big part of it.  Employees got promoted not by achieving goals or discovering new methods or benefiting the company, but by playing politics.  It's so bad that even HR directors have favorites.  For instance, if she likes you, she will respond to your inquiries, and if not then it is just going down the drain.  This made the turn over rate in the R&I highest comparing to other places (manufacturing, corporate...).  I would not recommend this place if you want to learn, grow, and teamwork.   I would strongly recommend it if you just want a monthly paycheck, a stable job, and not care about others.  Don't believe me, try to talk to someone who works in the R&I (Clark, NJ).
Advice: you want more, you need to care about the employees more.  and sometimes it is not only about money.  you must know what employees want to motivate and create a more productive environment
Pros: stable job, median salary, health insurance

Cons: Processes can be antiquated and hard to change
Advice: None
Pros: Good company, good workplace environment

Cons: No job description, no transition, fast paced
Advice: None
Pros: Diversity, creativity, start up environment

Cons: Corporate overreach was a bit much
Will take responsibility from various departments to pick up slack
Advice: None
Pros: Great learning opportunity, fun workplace, room for growth.

Cons: Heavy workload, little pay. No career growth. Only certain people get promoted!
Advice: None
Pros: Flexibility, work from home when necessary.

Cons: No life work balance and long hours
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible schedule for parents at times

Cons: long work hours, A lot of meetings
Advice: None

Cons: Low salary even for an intern
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work, inspiring people, kind leadership

Cons: Work life balance needed to have time for family
Advice: None
Pros: Great company to work at

Cons: At the end of the day it's all about who likes you and has your back, in particular when it comes to your boss. 
HR is the worse out there. Do not trust them, whatever they say. Anything and everything will be used against you down the line. 
At the end of the day employees are just numbers, and replaceable, no one cares about how it is really going and if you have a work life balance. A 15hr day is normal and rare are the GM's who let you comp the weekends you worked or traveled.
Advice: 360 reviews in order for the bad management to be penalized. To date it's all about what your N+1 or 2 thinks about you and HR doesn't care if it's personal even if you do a great job and have performed for years. Be honest, be fare! Treat people with respect and let them express themselves especially when they bring up a problem with their boss instead of burying it. The whole US organization needs a serious HR overall and the people they picked for that are the worst part of the system. People are not happy and too afraid to say it.
Pros: The people are incredible, creative and smart no doubt some of the best talents in the industry. It's one of the most creative environments out there and that's very exciting.

Cons: So disappointed with the way they’ve handled the quarantine and WFH policy during the pandemic. We are the only company returning to the office (Hudson Yards). No other company, that can work remotely (and be successful) are pushing their employees to come back in. Our numbers are up! We have proven we can be efficient, productive and successful while WFH. But “it’s not our culture.”
Every picture and quote yelling how happy we are to be back is propaganda. Everyone is drinking the Kool-Aid.
They’re giving small commutation stipends and snacks and have gone to great lengths to make us feel safe in the building. But they can’t control public transportation and the fact that the streets of NYC look
like NY in the 80’s. Hookers, homeless. Why can’t we continue to WFH when almost all work has to be done through TEAMS when we are IN the office?!
Advice: Listen to your employees and science. We aren’t through this yet and we are outperforming while WFH. Please be flexible and don’t pretend this “open door policy of communication “ won’t be held against us. We aren’t free to speak up. But we are afraid and frustrated that you are rushing to reopen.
Pros: It’s a well run, well managed corporation. Competitive salary, a lot of perks.  Extremely talented people at the top of their game.

Cons: Overworked, too much overtime, all about money
Advice: None
Pros: Great company to work for and future opportunities

Cons: Management treats headcount like a problem that must be contained at all costs. Employees are overworked because our job scope is ever-expanding, but management refuses to increase hiring. Work/life balance is non-existent. Turnover was obscenely high, and nearly all departures were voluntary.

There was far too much "Enron Math" in my group. No outright fraud, but our financial projections frequently blurred the line between irrational optimism and outright dishonesty.

Working in that environment was both physically and emotionally draining. I began the job filled with dreams and ambition, and by the time I finally resigned I was a broken, empty shell of a human being.
Advice: When I was recruited there was a giant poster with the slogan "WE NEED TALENT!"

I would remind management that you already HAVE talent. I have never worked with a smarter, more ambitious and dedicated group of people. You just need to figure out a way to keep them from walking out the door.
Pros: Innovative company, amazing people, you will never be bored. Good brand recognition, and employee perks are great. Company Store discount gets you 50% off all products.

If you're a guy you will be very popular with the ladies.

Cons: The quarter year management shifts, rearrange everything and upset the apple cart when they occur approximately every 4 years or so.  Many of the long time employees are cycled out and new younger employees are cycled in.  With that many long term employees, this is truly a tough place to say goodbye to.
Advice: Don't forget about the needs of the loyal and dedicated long term seniour employees as you court new younger talent.  Both have many assets.
Pros: L'Oreal USA represents the best and the brightest of our society.  It is a classically diversified company with a plethora of products, positions, plans and people!  There is always a new project going on and they are widely respected in their industry, strive to make the work experience a great event for all of their employees, and work to attain a great work like balance for everyone.  They try to keep the door open to fresh talent and make room for them.  Many of the employees become long term employees and are very proud of their work longevity.

Cons: Favoritism
Cult - Like Behavior
No Sincerity
Advice: Learn how to value and promote from within.
Pros: Learned a lot about L’Oreal

Cons: - One of those companies where there are "Kings" and "queens" and you have to kiss the ring.  GMs and operational heads are treated as gods and can make or destroy your career regardless of your talent and achievements.
- Steep learning curve (significant percentage of new hires don't survive the first year). 
- French culture strongly influences L'Oreal USA.  
- Expect emotional outbursts in meetings which is referred to as "Passion"
- Death by 1000 Meetings 
- Slow decision making....and even after decisions are made they get revisited
Advice: The company is making strong effort to address the obvious concerns regarding employees morale. This is a positive move but we are yet to see the benefits and impact of such programs such as SIMPLICITY. Also, encourage your senior management to be more humble and treat other with the deserved respect.
Pros: + Successful company with proud history and stability
+ Pension plan (not many companies still offer it)
+ Global presence opens opportunities to work in many different areas
+ There are some very smart people in this company and you can learn a lot from them (even if some processes are not smart)
+ Summer hours, volunteering, work from home, and other good programs

Cons: 1. VP's have no long term strategy  
2. Goal is to move orders from the next month up, and stuff the backdoors of customers. 
3. Long trail of emails where NAM's are spoken to in a very disrespectful manner. 
4. VP'S ask for a volume update every 2 hours, and they overcommit numbers to management to make themselves look good. 
5. Unreasonable goals that are not based on the customer. 
6. VP's scared to explain true conditions of market to SVP's.
Advice: I would advise that you let employee's have a ride along day before joining the very unorganized MCB division of Loreal. This will allow them to fully evaluate the role before joining.  I would not recommend anyone to leave a good established company to join this place. In 2015/2016 I did this and it the biggest regret that I have in life. 

With declining brands the company needs to set a strategy before the year starts. We are planning for 2017 in February of 2017. At my previous company we planned for the next year 9 to 11 months out. Strategy is top down in any organization, and right now I am very disappointed that L'Oréal is allowing a division to operate like this.
Pros: 1. Nothing positive about being a National Account    Manager in the MCB division

Cons: Only great for graduates colleges without experience who have never been involved in any type of organization . Hiring nice talent folks with diversity background, who will resign after 3 or 4 years.   Most people behave well most of the time, but problems can develop in the workplace with staff that show extreme, persistent and difficult behavior;disagreement ending with disputes 
the only way to reach to the top is mingling with upper level( 2 or 3 positions above your supervisor) .
Low core of values and principles.Reward dictatorship vs leadership.  L'Oreal philosophy: " the Manager is always right;acquiesce any order and proceed ..otherwise,  game is over.. the decisions taking too long. Acknowledging your mistakes but  not merit. HR is non existent.Salary increases 1-2% , make sure to sign a non compete agreement.  Notify 4 weeks prior your leaving to non competitor.
Advice: Stop flushing nice talent people down the drain!! .Stop Smiling and misleading future employees with false promises .Look with you've done with us!! You may have ruined our career, our hopes ,our passions but you haven't ruined our life.
Pros: Good salary with Benefits is a plus.  Discount store, Free samples every time you participate in studies.Very limited 2 classes per year.Assist Events in NYC and NJ. Holidays, Volunteer day and stability company. work/ life balance leeway

Cons: Loreal USA is a very large company.  Working in a remote area it is sometimes hard to identify the correct channel for questions and concerns.  I would love an opportunity to spend time at headquarters to truly understand the entire processes of the company.
Advice: I think Senior Management needs to trust their employees until given a reason not to.  I realize some positions are hard to determine accurate work load.  I sometimes feel I am given busy work to fill hours during slow seasons and working many hours during the busy season to get the job accomplished.  I would love the numbers to dictate the work load.
Pros: Loreal USA is very generous with the full compensation package.  Althought the average salary may be average in comparison to similar jobs in the same industry, the complementary benefits package is outstanding.  Loreal USA is very flexible and truly cares about a balanced life between professional and personal goals and values.  Loreal USA conducts regular anonymous surveys to ensure they are treating employees fairly.

Cons: Management & HR over-emphasizes the ability/benefit to transfer into other divisions or into other roles but when faced with the request to transfer to another division or internal role they are not as open.  You're wanted to be open to relocation but only on their terms.
Many "politics" at play from communication to executing promotions- the open door they speak of is not as open as it should be... especially with fear of retaliation being a real thing.
Advice: A happy employee is a more productive employee.  Try to lessen the politics behind everything- it's not motivating and listen to your teams.... also listen to what they are afraid to say and are not saying.  There is a lot of frustration that stays bottled up.
Pros: Great benefits.  Large diverse company with many other divisions to give L'OREAL a strong foot hold in the large world of cosmetics which favors job security.  Employee perks are another nice thing you don't see in other companies.  The pros from the incredible benefits outweigh the cons!

Cons: Not a good place for innovation, don't expect to have many champions supporting any opportunities for improvement you pursue. Current state of technologies they use is 10 years behind other leaders in the industry. 

Career development based entirely on politics, hence upper-management is incompetent. Many bad leaders advance their careers because of the way they hold themselves in meetings, co-signing whatever other high-profile people say. Way too much finger pointing due to bad leadership. You will find that there are no performance reviews for a reason. 

Everything moves so slowly because upper-management has to micro-manage everything. France is at the center of everything. French colleauges are put on a pedestal. 

Very hit or miss depending on your manager/team. I've heard/seen some terrible misstreatment from colleagues and their managers.

L'Oreal does not develop you, you have to put the effort into developing yourself. You will find that some of your smartest colleauges will leave the company. The ones who have been here for many years are usually stuck.
Advice: Performance reviews are really key to ensure that you are actually promoting strong performers and good leaders. 

Start advancing technologies and listen to employees on what are key priorities. To ensure agility in consumer market, find out what is slowing down your employees. 

Stop the finger pointing.
Pros: Good benefits (especially if you stay for 3+ years), never boring, fast-paced environment, cool products that you get to work on

Cons: Micro managing boss, work life balance, work all holidays, long hours, late nights, closed over 30 stores
Advice: Trust your managers
Pros: 401k, vacation, decent pay, benefits, PTO

Cons: Misogyny
Lots of men in management, condescending
Advice: None
Pros: Employee discount 
Lots of learning
Nice workspaces
Good locations

Cons: Like most large corporations, Corporate is not in touch with the stores, the customer, the product or marketing. Regional managers are overwhelmed and doing little more than letting us know how overwhelmed they are. This must go back to it being impossible to get fired here. 
All policy and procedure manuals (of which there have been 4 in the last year) boast of an "Open Door" policy. However, contacting anyone above your direct supervisor (including HR) is harshly discouraged, frowned upon and retaliated against.
Advice: Get into the stores and find out what is really going on. Don't use the economy as an excuse to short your employees leadership or direction. It is quickly affecting business and morale. Put in more effort in the department of Human Resources whether it means, time, staffing, money or all 3. It will be worth it. How many employees are still working for you just because it's impossible to get fired? How many of them would work harder if you made it feel like it was worth it?
Pros: "Gratis" or free goods allowances. L'Oreal owns many companies and we have access to discounts and free goods from many of them. Great medical benefits, especially for pregnant women. 
Quality of life can be high here if you don't mind your store standards and quality being very low. It is impossible to be fired or let go.

Cons: Low pay stressful environment and no coaching
Advice: None
Pros: Multinational with a multicultural vibe

Cons: L’Oréal is not a place for everyone.  It can be a challenging environment with high visibility and ownership but with little direction and process.  Those who crave the direction and order that process brings, would not do well here.  One needs to quickly develop a point of view and be confident in opinions and decisions.  The company is also quite large so it can also be difficult to find the necessary answers so those who lack initiative and resourcefulness would also find it a difficult environment to navigate.
Advice: None
Pros: I have worked in several large retail corporations and L'Oréal is by far the best career move I've made! The culture is quite unique; extremely innovative, entrepreneurial and diverse. The opportunities for growth and development are endless as long as you are proactive; those who complain about the lack of development are generally the ones who do not take control of their careers and actively seek out the necessary conversations with management and HR.  In the 2+ years here, I have had great visibility to the entire business, have been given many stretch assignments which push my critical thinking and analytics and have also developed an irreplaceable network of very intelligent professionals from whom I learn so much. My team dynamic is wonderfully collaborative and I feel extremely supported by my manager and colleagues.  The benefits are great with a company store and café on-site.

Cons: NO Work/Life Balance
Extremely Demanding
Long Hours, Weekends
Lack of support from co-workers; no one has the time or patience to assist when needed
Absolutely no training
"Sink or Swim"
Too much work, and not enough employees to accomplish objectives
Unorganized
No set processes - "just wing it" attitude
Lack of respect from Upper Management
The "little people" tend to be forgotten
Needy, selfish and pretentious
Catty & Immature - Gossip, drama
Advice: There is an extreme lack in direction and integration for new employees.  Rather than learning piece by piece, you are submerged in unfamiliar material and expected to do wonderful.  I did not feel that I received the support I needed to be successful there, nor was I able to maintain my personal life.  A company as large and successful as this should have the manpower and processes to allow its employees to succeed with confidence.  Instead, it is a daily struggle to stay afloat and the end result is not worth the workload it took to get there.

You should "work to live," not "live to work."  At L'Oreal, you live to work.

I wan'ted to work for L'Oreal more than anything, but I was truly disappointed.
Pros: Reputable Company Name
Learning Experience (Positive and Negative)
Employee Perks - Company Store, Discounts
Energetic Events
Opened my eyes about the beauty industry
Global Experience
Helped me decide where I DON'T want to be

Cons: Zero respect for work life balance
Highly irrational thinking/actions are tolerated and sometimes rewarded
People work very hard but no smart.  There is a lot of waste of money, time and resources due to poor planning 
Treat vendors poorly.  Constantly have vendors bid for projects and then expect at least 2-3x the amount of work from them without compensating them for their time
It is very much a hyper political environment.  Management is paranoid and alliances are very quickly built.   Not playing a long will cost you.
Advice: Fix the culture.  L'Oreal is known for it's horrible work/life balance and for the irrational and sometimes hysterical behavior of senior management.  While the company is profitable and growing, I believe there are massive amounts of profit being lost due to the horrible culture of the company. 

There are teams dedicated to just coming in and spinning within L'Oreal.  While it is good to have someone come in and push you or provide learnings, I would suggest having headcount to help execute.  It is useless to have someone constantly come in and tell you what you can do better.  Have them help do it.  That is L'Oreal's problem.  A lot of spinning but not much support.
Pros: They will move you up quickly if you are willing to work 24/7 and they know there are 1,000 people waiting in line to take your place if you don't want to
Analytical
Will keep you on your toes
Wondeful benefits 
Great perks

Cons: internal growth opportunities in technical teams are slow
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Great Name brand with khiels

Cons: Highly political, which made it difficult to navigate
Advice: None
Pros: Nice people to connect and learn from

Cons: Long hours and sometimes a lot of travel
Advice: None
Pros: Bosses were very helpful guiding my transition

Cons: Can be tough at times
Advice: None
Pros: Entrepreneurial, challenging, lots of opportunities

Cons: Always seemed like you needed a "French connection", a top 3 Ivy League degree, or have worked at Goldman or Google prior to garner special respect and move up the ladder quickly.  Extremely elitist company.  You must "look" the part as well.  Marketing environment is a very competitive, tournament theory environment.  Long hours, limited work-life balance in the New York locations, much better if you work at the New Jersey campus.  Pay is average for the industry.  A great place to work and gain experience in your 20's to early 30's, not sure beyond that as pace is frenetic, but never boring!
Advice: Keep the high standards, wish you continued success!
Pros: Excellent culture of development with top notch training programs, as they are passionate about "talent", stretch assignments, above average people managers who encourage personal development, tuition reimbursement, international assignments, work with extremely talented people from all over the world, products and brand are iconic and known globally, marketers are top notch, experience here is good for career growth and looks good on the resume, excellent place to launch your career (post UG or MBA), especially in brand marketing, great product perks.

Cons: Nothing at this current moment
Advice: None
Pros: Good for people to learn

Cons: L'Oreal is a marketing machine.  EVERYTHING is time sensitive and urgent so the job can be very demanding and stressful, but you will find this with any company.  The key is to utilize the support structures available.  Also, Senior management needs to be consistent is utilization of the work from home policy.
Advice: Employees need to feel heard and supported (empathy, empathy, empathy) this is a key factor in reducing turnover.
Pros: L'Oreal is a huge corporation so you have the opportunity to redefine your career and pursue new opportunities within the same company.  There is endless room for growth and ample opportunity to present and interact with the Executive Management.  There are various support groups in place to create a strong sense of community.    Which is important during times of crisis whether personal or professional.  In addition Senior management is focused on ensuring their employees can maintain a work/life balance and utilize the work from home policy.   This is a huge advantage for working parents. L'Oreal also offers great benefits (i.e. matching 401K and Pension).  They are also very generous with paid holidays!

Cons: Slow to adapt to modernize its approach to the future of work, design and technology. The company plays a lot of “short game” strategies, not often giving new ideas or technology the opportunity to grow and evolve in the long term. 

The organization responds to industry change rather than leads it.

Expect to work LONG LONG LONG hours. Generous (but traditional) benefits, but being able to use vacation/pto can be challenge as often while approved, you’ll find yourself “just checking emails” because you know that if you’re gone fore more than a long weekend, the amount of work and anxiety that build up in your absence will be untenable. 

It is not an “Employee First” company - it is a company focused on profit and revenue first, products second, consumers third and employees a distant last place.

Great place to learn the industry, cut your teeth and then move on and realize not every company expects employees to fully commit themselves and their future to share holder profits.
Advice: Become an employee first organization.
Pros: The company has very solid financial footing. It navigated the complexities of COVID-19 pretty well and is in the process of some genuine change especially around equity of pay for women and people of color. Produces some very fine products.

Cons: Lack of communication, slow to react to important issues, upper management does not listen, if you know "some one" then you will automatically get promoted. 
We have been working from home for over 3 months now. At the beginning we were told we were very productive and absolutely no issues, we were praised for the good work. And now it's an issue and were told we must work in oofice in order to work cohesively, umm isn't thst what you were praising us for doing in the beginning ? Confusing...
Also with the wake of BLM movement, L'Oreal corp communications was extremely slow in responding or in making a statement. And only when top level executives who are black demanded for a change was it when they made a statement and now are having "workshops" and "free space groups" for affected employees. Some how I am not convinced out UPPER MANAGEMENT is actually listening. My only hope is that they are and action will be taken.
Advice: Listen
Listen
Listen! 
Remove your old ways of thinking and allow for new innovated ways of working.
Pros: Free products and discounted products.

Cons: Unnecessary and almost daily meetings/presentations to prepare for that prevent you from completing the necessary operational tasks, leading to extremely long work hours, stressful job and employees complaining all the time, hard to be promoted to top management if not French, absolutely no respect for personal life outside of work (i.e. managers stay on Friday nights past 8pm on a weekly basis and you feel obliged as well), really low pay considering all of the hours and effort put in, very heavily-based email culture (bombardment every day), people doing the workload of 2 or more people (workload not properly distributed).
Advice: Hire more people to better distribute workload, have respect for work-life balance, eliminate the unnecessary meetings/presentations just for the sake of putting together PPTs, realize that you're losing a ton of great employees who can find better salaries and a more well-balanced life elsewhere.
Pros: Working with some of the best brands/products out there, an opportunity to meet a lot of nice people from all over the world and practice your language skills, travel and go to fun events, discounted and/or free products from time to time, always being in the "know" on what goes on in the industry/marketing

Cons: - workload can be very significant at times (while always interesting)
- As any large organization, you have to learn how to work in a matrix environment (the many layers in place can be intimidating at first - nothing unmanageable)
Advice: - Continue to simplify the too many organization layers. 
- Continue the good work on the innovation side, remaining the leader in the beauty industry. Amazing corporation and talents, attracted by the culture and the power/image of the Brands.
Pros: - Large pool of Industry best talents make it a great place to learn and to challenge yourself
- Passion, leadership are valued and recognized
- Your career is in your hands, and depends on your ability to propose and drive change
- potential to move between the large portfolio of Brands and Functions
- Best managers, who are continuously looking at optimizing the organization structure, benchmarking the corporation against the competition, and promoting innovation (multiple awards are in place to promote innovation)
- I believe that you either move up, and stay within the corporation, or you are out. The culture is very competitive, aka no room for average performers. This is a strong plus in my opinion.

Cons: French management overly involved, many useless meetings with management that are not driving the P&L.  If you have one of the HR people who is more into their own self promotion and sorority-clique status, you are in trouble. This company is all about hard work, which is fine, but the upside is missing.  Employees don't receive pay for performance or even explanations about what their future could hold...time to really think about whether employee retention matters.
Advice: Focus on better employee rewards for performance.  While the workforce is female,where is the female management?  Even in non-P&L positions there is a lack of diversity.
Pros: Innovation machine, bright people, hard workers.  Management is good, products are fantastic. If you want to take ownership and bring things to life, anything is possible at L'Oreal.  There are a lot of truly dynamic thinkers.  No one is afraid of taking risks on new ideas.

Cons: - They work you to the bone and then some
- Top heavy
- American workers seen as contributing to the bottom line but not necessarily the creative vision
- Frustrating, projects get mishandled, changed or dropped at the eleventh hour and you are expected to stay and redo everything overnight or on weekends
- (Some) management wants to make a splash and move onto another division so long-term vision can waver and credit is rarely given to the workers
- Salary is below average
Advice: - Listen to employees feedback and act on it.  There was a worldwide employee survey I'm sure they spent lots of money on but no one believed things would change as a result.
Pros: - Plenty of internal growth opportunities
- Excellent benefits
- Fun perks: travel, free goods, events
- Good products you can believe in
- Smart coworkers who take pride in their work

Cons: Upper management limits store staffing capabilities, and does not follow company ethics. L'Oreal hires District Managers who provide little support based on favoritism, openly considers Store managers and Key holders expendable, who consistently contact you personally after hours, and supplies zero recourse through an HR department that mirrors the DM's.
Store managers &amp; Keyholders are expected to work alone regularly, including while sick or injured, during huge sales and known surges, simultaneously with huge shipments, inventory, stocking, product facing, price labeling, memorizing codes that are not automated, new product introductions, and with complete system failure. 
All positions only receive 20 hours of paid training. So staffing correctly is unmanageable.
No IT support &amp; seriously outdated system means working alone with long lines, irritated customers, mistakes, and loss of sales along with sanity.
I would not recommend any position to anyone, including students and young people new to the workforce. There are far better jobs with better pay, management, benefits and support.
Advice: Adopt in person training , supervise your DM's, create achievable requirements per position, keep stores staffed, provide all employees with living wages and medical benefits. Invest a huge portion of the SCNC money back into your stores, systems and people instead.
Pros: Discounts, Customers, Products, Samples, Networking

Cons: Customer service does not offer a lot of upward promotional opportunities. In order to advance as a member of customer service, you need to move to a different department. Company wont work towards full time work from home, even though job can be done from home.
Advice: Listen to direct feedback from employees and make changes that actually effect their concerns. Address the issue, do not try to manage the issue that is still occurring, fix the issue. If there are no promotions within the departments, promote within the departments; create roles. If employees want to work from home, allow for the option to work from home.
Pros: L'Oreal offers good pay and you are able to learn a lot of skills. Its clear that they are concerned with diversity, inclusion and the overall morale of the business. Benefits are good but could be better. They do a good job of promoting within. There is very little micromanaging within this department and they encourage ownership and accountability.

Cons: Salary and benefits are below industry average.  The R&D buildings at Clark, New Jersey, are falling apart.  And the new building is no where in sight.  Some buildings have serious OSHA violations, such as fume hood being vented back inside the building, lab coats are building worn outside of lab areas, dubious record keeping.  Unless you're French-speaking (for example, French-Canadian, native French, French-American), then you're out of luck.
Advice: End the French discrimination against non-French-speaking staff.  Empower the R&D.
Pros: L'Oreal is a widely recognized name and seems to induce French romanticism among female audience.  50% in company stores for products ranging from Lancome, Kiehl's, Ralph Lauren fragrances, Armani fragrances, Matrix, Redken, Maybelline, Garnier, etc.  Also, there are bi-monthly "free goods" available from company stores.  Good opportunity to impress people with products (cost of goods is minimal) bought at half off.

Cons: While the company advocates for transparency, sometimes you can't get the reasoning behind certain top-level decisions that don't make sense logically. 
After being here for a certain time, you will notice that everyone is very cliquey.  Tends to be very gossipy around here. Not as collegial as you would think it would be for such a large company. I think the company can improve on ensuring that everyone is not being left out and that everyone has an equal voice.
Advice: None
Pros: You will learn a lot about Marketing that goes beyond the cosmetics industry.  A lot of people come from other large CPG conglomerates, Advertising Agencies, Consultancies, etc. Everyone is willing to talk to you about their previous roles and how their current roles fits into L'Oreal. L'Oreal is a great place to build a career or as a stepping stone to something more fitting if L'Oreal isn't for you.

Cons: the work life balance in the professional products division (PPD) is non-existent. You are expected to be available all hours of the day and night and travel for weeks on end (pre-covid). There are a few women in upper management positions who have been there forever and who dictate the entire structure. They are catty and hateful and do not care for any employee but themselves. All very company growth focused. they do not care for their employees.
Advice: focus on the employees, and in PPD, focus on the professional salons. stop letting a few long haulers dictate an entire divisions structure. and maybe don't lay off 1/3 of your division force during covid even though you experience growth
Pros: good pay, great growth opportunity, good people at the lower positions, and the benefits can not be beat. I head that the LUXE, CPD, and Active divisions are great to work in

Cons: In order to succeed here, you need to fit into the "L'Oreal mold". That is someone who is passionate about beauty and fashion, major type A personality, organized, and willing to sacrifice work-life balance for the company.

A lot of fakeness - HR lying to your face about your performance, the world-wide CEO acting like he cares about sustainability and work-life balance... The US CEO is practically anti-work-life balance. As soon as Roze arrived, L'Oreal USA had its first layoff ever in the history of the company. His policies on cutting headcount are ridiculous - you can't grow a brand with a one-person marketing team.
Advice: Hire more people. There's "lean" and there's unrealistic. L'Oreal's headcount situation falls into the latter. Plan ahead, plan less meaningless meetings, don't expect your team to stay late or work on weekends.
Pros: Good benefits, some interesting projects if you're lucky enough to be put on an interesting or cool brand. Lots of entrepreneurial opportunities - you can treat the business like it's your own (except you have to answer to like 20 French people above you).

Cons: you will be challenged & stretched, make sure you are into that before you apply
Advice: Continue listening to employees, believing in them and taking bets!
Pros: I love L'Oreal!  After more than ten years with the company, I am still excited to come here each and every day.  L'Oreal has provided me with many different jobs, opportunities, career moves within many divisions and locations. My management has always believed in me, challenged me and is helping me to develop into a becoming a strategic leader.  I am surrounded by world-class talent in R&I, creative and innovative scientists that do not settle for status quo. In addition to great benefits, we also have work flexibility, summer hours and a strong management team.

Cons: Every company has its cons but I think L'Oreal's are minimal.  There are examples of people being overworked but I think it is due to lack of project management with their manager.  The company is very marketing focused which can hurt other departments. Very high turnover in marketing.
Advice: Good job with the initiation of the Beauty Shaker awards. It has been a great opportunity to expose our accomplishments to other departments as well a senior management.
Pros: L'Oreal USA has an energetic atmosphere working with outstanding products.  Everyday presents new challenges that keep us on our toes and the work days fly by.  We get great satisfaction when we provide solutions to users that make their jobs easier.  The company benefits are better than any other company I know of.  401k, pension, product discounts, summer half day fridays, quarterly mixers, training classes are encouraged, gym memberships, free on site flu shots and so much more!

Cons: 1. Unrealistic workload 
2. Managers with no empathy or regard to your home life 
3. Directors who fail as leaders, who imply that working less than 12 hours per is worthy of punishment 
4. Slave like culture 
5. No work life balance - no matter how much their propaganda says there is
6. Bullies in the work force 
7. Taking shortcuts and risks on a regular will eventually lead to down fall
Advice: Instead of training us on resilience and jumping to conclusions. Treat employees with care and respect. You go home to your family on time - why can’t your employees do the same. 

Hire sufficient staffing 
Fire directors who are fake leaders or treat their employees like slaves or bully or belittle until an employee is in tears 
Move the people who deserve promotions instead of fueling “gossip” to keep them in a position they’re good in.
Defend your employees
Trust your employees 

(These are all complaints that have already been taken to HR repeatedly by numerous of employees to no avail) 

Or they Will walk
Pros: There no longer are pros to this work environment except the people who try to keep you sane under the unrealistic expectations from upper management

Cons: When I was hired the company was going through a major overhaul. People were being hired and fired and positions combined. I was excited to have the job until I found out I would not recieve proper training. It was fine at first for I am a fast learner but since the girl who had my position previously had left on bad terms she left a lot of unfinished business that, naturally, my boss decided to blame on me since she no longer had her previous employee to blame. I took it in stride until my boss tried to not pay be for overtime. I had to wait an entire month to recieve my money and was fired for even requesting it!
Advice: You are not always right! What a surprise. People are hired to help you, allow them to do their jobs. Train when necessary. Relax!
Pros: Name recognition, job duties, challenging, creative, large company, trips, working with talented people, discount on products.

Cons: Disorganized overall, computer systems  and work processes do not function very effectively and these systems are the backbone of the work. Overall everything should be much more streamlined with more careful planning. Pay is not particularly great regardless of the effort and success achieved. Need to answer to a lot of people. Priorities are not clearly defined and are constantly changing. I did not recommend my son to attempt to get a job with the company. Someone smart with a good education could and should do much better than this company, at least for the long term. For a short term 1-5 years it could be a good experience.
Advice: Need to be more organized. Need stronger leadership that is not done solely via multiple committees.
Pros: After 10 years time off is excellent. The company is ever evolving. Lot's of holidays. The company generally takes great care in terms of the products that are put out on the market.

Cons: - Abusive and manipulative behavior by management tolerated here; culture encourages people to look the other way or make excuses. 
- Can be an intense, competitive environment
- Customary to work late  
- Meeting-centric culture so no one gets anything done unless you put in late nights
Advice: Ideally you luck out and land on a small team with a nice boss, otherwise, good luck. Once you get L'Oreal on your resume you are set to move onto greater things so just hang in there for a year, stock up on half off beauty products and find another place where there arent quite so many narcissists in managerial positions who feel most powerful when trying to make you feel small.
Pros: - Lots of free/reduced price beauty products
- Opportunity to stretch yourself and build new skills (so much freedom!)
- Summer Fridays 
_ Beautiful new office
- L'Oreal takes care of its employees

Cons: - Pitches a “flexible” and “social oriented” structure, but this covers up for the lack of process, and stakeholder conflicts 
- A very “I” focused organization. I’ve never experienced so many people taking credit for something their team, or someone they’ve managed has done 
- Talks a big innovation and digital game, but has nothing to show for it; Digital turnover is extremely high. Everyone leaves in about a year because the work is juvenile 
- Horrible office location with nothing around. It won’t be a real thriving area for another 5 years 
- Mediocre, and overpriced food and snacks you have to pay for in the cafe 
- Long hours 

Honestly, run far away, or ask around. People in the industry will tell you what it’s like
Advice: Adapt, or you’ll never attract and retain the talent you need to get back on top
Pros: - Depending on your team, some of the most wonderful and Type A people you’ll meet 
- Gym benefits, Summer Fridays, Free products

Cons: No work life balance 

Overworked 

Salary is great until you realize you’re doing 1.5-2 people’s jobs

Most managers and directors are extremely smart but are not suitable for leadership 

Not a good fit for experienced professionals
Advice: Leadership teams need to be trained on how to delegate responsibilities. 

Listen to employees when they complain about workload. Stop saying “work smarter” that line is old. 

Hire management consultants to figure out why this place is a revolving door for experienced professionals.
Pros: Product discount 

ability to travel 

You will learn a lot

Free food around the office at least once a week 

Office looks dull but is expected to receive a makeover in 2017 (the photos on LinkedIn look great)

Open collaboration

Lots of team building activities (at times it’s just a distraction because you have so much work to do). However it temporarily relieves the stress. 

Great for college graduates or someone entering corporate America for the first time.

Cons: No work/life balance, work from home is not the culture, no flexibility, no compassion
Advice: Employees are being forced back into work during a pandemic.  Anyone who is opposed to going back is required to submit a formal claim which then has to be approved by HR/upper management.   Reasons include a pre-existing health condition, which requires an extensive submission of forms from doctors and test results which then have to be validated.  Anxiety and fear are not options to apply.  Childcare needs have to be validated with evidence there is no family nearby, spouse cannot accommodate, friends, sitters, camps or daycares available during the pandemic regardless of needs or financial situation.  HR has right to approve or deny based on their "investigation".
Pros: Free product perks, interesting work

Cons: I was spread so thin and upper management was spread so thin there is literally zero work life balance.  They work you to the bone and take everything you have without giving you much in return.  Communication is sparse and authenticity rare.
Advice: People work for people.  It's obvious the individuals who are there that don't like what they are doing.  If they are in upper management and responsible for motivating and leading a core group of individuals and they don't do that then replace them.   It becomes exhausting, defeating, and discouraging over time to keep giving 110% when you don't have the proper leadership keeping you going.
Pros: The pay was decent and the opportunities for growth are nice.  I really liked my actual job that I was doing.  It was rewarding with the people I personally was working with.  I am also a glass half full kind of person so I stayed focused on the work and not all of the other stuff.

Cons: I rarely write reviews, but this place has me so worked up I will actually take time out of my day to do this.  If I could give a score of less than 1, I would give Loreal a negative number of stars.  I don't know how Loreal has such a high score on Glassdoor because 95% of the people i met in my two years at Loreal were all miserable.  Absolutely miserable.  I worked at the Clark corporate office and the place was a revolving door.  People in all levels came and went pretty much weekly.  I have never seen so much turn over anywhere.  

The culture at Loreal is horrible.  Basically each person does two jobs.  The workload is unbelievable.  If you can't keep up, they will be more than happy to fire you.  They promote the people that destroy others and are nasty.  This just drives the culture.

DONT WORK HERE, YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.
Advice: Quit, just like everyone else.
Pros: Absolutely nothing.  Seriously, i mean it.

Cons: Especially in Marketing, I feel like the company specializes in bringing-in young go-getters who think they are going to be the next CEO. They are milked to burn-out at which they move on and the cycle continues through high turn-over. Advancement through the company has more to do with who you know than the effectiveness of your work.
Advice: Fewer launches that are better planned and better focused-on. This would be even more the case for promotions on which we do way too much
Pros: The company is fast paced. Though it may feel chaotic to outsiders coming from more structured backgrounds, there is a lot to be said for its methodology in constantly looking to the next new launch and being flexible to the needs of the local market. People are great, quite young and highly energetic and social. Great place to have on your resume.

Cons: They are forcing us to return to the office (starting 6/29 at 25%, now starting next week at 50%) and employees are very concerned about their safety commuting and in the building
Advice: You trusted us to work remotely (and we did, very very well and have been so dedicated to our roles and the success of the company) for the past four months. Why are you acting like we are in the EU and forcing us to return to the office when we can work remotely? It is unsafe and we feel like guinea pigs and with no value or voice.
Pros: I am a longtime employee who loves my job and my team

Cons: R & I has a tendency to reward mediocrity and does not provide enough challenge to junior levels.  In addition there is a strong culture of negative competition, in the spirit of "if I make you look bad, I'll get promoted".  New management in the past couple of years is changing the culture but it is slow.
Advice: Reward excellence and provide more challenge, coaching and mentoring to junior levels.  Create and engaged workforce.  I believe Frederic Roze has excellent ideas that are not being implemented or supported within some areas of R&I.
Pros: L'Oreal offers some exciting research opportunities and a fast paced environment.  There are great career development courses offered to all levels.  Some managers are truly excellent and you will learn a lot from working within this company.

Cons: There are significant company culture issues that come from the very top (Paris). Sometimes I forget we aren’t saving lives at work. Every task is both urgent and critically important, meaning it becomes impossible to prioritize work and you constantly feel pulled in too many directions, at the detriment of productivity. Depending on where you work in the organization, you can have decent work life balance, in terms of leaving at a reasonable hour and having weekends free. However work stress will often enter into your personal life, even if you’re not “working.” You have to give a lot of yourself to this company. 

The issues with company culture have become more apparent with Covid and the Black Lives Matter movement. As it relates to BLM, brand communication teams were completely restricted in what the brands could say and when. When approved messaging finally came through, it was scrubbed and “corporatized” with meaningless jargon. Black employees were not welcome to advise on messaging. Internally, it took several days for the organization to acknowledge what was happening with employees, and only after a group of employees demanded action and support. L’Oréal also has a diversity issue in hiring - very few employees of color in our corporate teams. 

Regarding Covid, the organization started strong with messages of support, but those were quickly replaced with ominous and unclear messaging around returning to the office (mostly about cumbersome safety protocols such as in office temperature checks). While other companies were providing clear timelines for return, L’Oreal USA refused to provide any sense of timing for the NY offices, even as employees were asking daily (many had left the city). When the company finally announced a return to office date (June 29 - 2+ months before most corporate offices), employees received 1 WEEK’S notice that they would be expected back. The announcement also came at 6:45pm the night before Juneteenth, which the company had given employees as a PTO day of cultural observance. This felt like an effort to take advantage of the Juneteenth holiday to minimize swirl over the announcement - really distasteful. L’Oreal is rushing corporate employees back to the office simply for face time, irresponsible both to the health of employees and essential workers who are using public transportation. Employee morale is very low - employees do not feel proud to work for L’Oréal right now.
Advice: Think more critically about how your decisions impact employees. Employees expect more from the companies they work for than ever before.  Create a company that people are proud to work for.  And remember that end of the day, it’s just lipstick.
Pros: - Very smart, dedicated and kind coworkers who make coming to work enjoyable
- Portfolio of winning brands
- Caring leadership in most parts of the organization
- Opportunity to make your job what you want - job descriptions can be flexible and you can always “do more” if you look for ways to add value 
- Nice office, good perks e.g. company store and nail salon

Cons: Management is terrible at understanding why employees are not satisfied with their roles; workload is so high that most people I worked with worked on the weekends regularly (keep in mind this should be a 9-5 job), I regularly worked till midnight and on the weekends when I was really busy; pay raises were offensively low (I knew my coworkers who were doing the same job as me got paid $10-15k more than me and I brought that up and I got a paltry 2.5% raise at the end of the year, not even when I brought up the pay disparity); didn't even get an exit interview when leaving; was forced between my job and my safety in the middle of the pandemic (even though we had proven that we could do our jobs remotely for the previous six months); too worried about office politics to actually get work done
Advice: actually listen to your employees when we complain and maybe the turnover rate wouldn't be as high, and you wouldn't lose good talent
Pros: Made some good friends here, company store discount

Cons: –Too much emphasis on making friends with your manager.
–Incompetent people easily promoted. 
–Too much emphasis on doing what works in France, no emphasis on the US customer.
–Lack of care overall.
–Senior management is out of touch, the company is too big.
–Not a good place for a hard worker.
–Too many employees who have no clue about how in-house processes force missed deadlines.
–Management ruins the successful business acquired by L'Oreal because many of the management staff in charge have no clue how to run a business, nor do they care.
–"The L'Oreal way" was the worst.
–The clique environment is sickening.
–If you are one of the chosen few you will succeed, if you are not you are passed over for promotions, you get less than stellar reviews, and/or you are laid off.
Advice: –Stop buying up your competition and start properly running the US business. 
–The company is poorly run.
–What works in France does not work in the states.
–If you want to attract and keep great talent treat them well, pay them well, do not scapegoat them.
Pros: –Nice offices
–Lots of freebies
–You will really appreciate your next job outside of the L'Oreal culture.

Cons: I really can't think of major cons to working here! If you do a good job, you will be taken care of. If you always complain, you won't help yourself. Yes sometimes it's late days but not always and you need to be responsible for managing your life. Make the most of your time at work so that you can leave at a good time. This is possible here provided you have a good relationship with your management and you get stuff done. Remember people don't leave companies, they leave managers.
Advice: Supportive and attentive management makes all the difference in a job day to day. Make sure the right people are leading teams and developing talent.
Pros: - exciting industry leader
- fast paced projects
- free product
- great healthcare benefits
- flexible work environment (depends on your work role and management)
- many advancement opportunities and the ability to rotate to new functions/teams

Cons: Limited visibility in the company unless you work in the NY office. High likelihood that you will be managed by someone very young who has no management experience but is being "coached" often to the detriment of your own development. Managers will often take credit for your work and your ideas with no acknowledgement or appreciation for the contribution. Quality of work sometimes takes a back seat to meeting deadlines.
Advice: Realize that your older employees have not only professional experience but life experience that lends to better decision making. Stop coaching young inexperienced managers at the expense of those who know their jobs well. It's not worth losing entire departments several times over just to save one incompetent manager.
Pros: Exposure to marketing research and expertise that is second to none in the industry. The opportunity to work with some very talented and driven professionals. Great benefits and free product perks.

Cons: Not a company for everyone. Demanding in many regards. Not a traditional environment. There is vision and direction at the top but then it is up to you to figure out how to advance your area of responsibility. It may feel inefficient at times.
Advice: Keep doing the great work you have started to make L Oreal USA a more efficient place to work and to empower people down the organization to own their HR issues.
Pros: If you like to be a champion, to be surrounded with amazing people, to be part of an Industry that does good to the world, to work on complex and challenging business models, to be given  opportunities to have early responsibilities and to make your mark, that is the company for you. It is also a company that gives a lot. The benefits are great and didn't go away during the crisis.

Cons: -Be prepared to work very hard with little recognition and appreciation
-Long hours and expectations to constantly check-in even when off
-Lots of talk and little to no-portunity for cross brand or cross divisional moves. HR is useless.
-Competitive coworkers and TOO MANY internal corporate politics
-Other Snr Management will be threatened by young, smart, hungry go-getters and WILL throw you under the bus, keep you from spotlight or get rid of you.
Advice: -Re-evaluate VP levels. Some are really great. Others are really awful with no care for their employees career development. They causing really smart young talent to RUN!
-HR needs to help deliver on "Corporate Promises" - moving around company; explorere programs etc
-Smaller brands operate like its 1980. They are decades beyond Mass and Luxury brands.
Pros: -Great Resume Builder
-Some really intelligent Snr Management and able to learn and grow from
-Marketplace respect of Brand Marketing and Media Budget
-Great Benefits (401k, Equinox, Pension)

Cons: Highly hierarchical, your ability to get anything done depends on who you know and who can introduce you to the people high up. Sometimes chaotic and disorganized, information does not flow well, perhaps because it is perceived as power so nobody wants to give it up.
Groups work independently of each other and it is very difficult to cross boundaries and collaborate.
No technical ladder
Advice: Value technical contributors as much as managers. Offer flexible schedule, life-work balance is very hard when you have meetings in the evenings and still expected to be in the office 9-5 (flexibility is only offered to managers and above)
Pros: Interesting work, international opportunities., very nice intelligent people to work with. 
Good values and overall a very ethic company regardless of what activists groups say about the "cosmetic industry"
A company that invests in and value their people

Cons: Clear preference for white, French men to advance to true senior leadership. It's not a fast-moving company and you're probably not going to learn much that would make you more valuable to a small, agile company - I definitely felt my skills deteriorated in my few years there. SO MUCH red tape when trying to do anything outside the company's norms. They really want each brand to behave the same, have the same website, etc. Forced employees to come back WAY too early from quarantine (August) when there is no reason for desk workers to be in the office.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work-life balance on the team I worked on, though I've heard it very much depends on the team and your manager. Very solid pay, raise schedule, and bonus structure, and bonuses were paid out fairly. Clear path to getting promoted, at least up until the AVP level, where a lot of people seem to get stuck. Good benefits and maternity/paternity leave, 401k match, and pension.

Cons: This place is a classic example of a hamster wheel.  You keep working harder and harder, with nothing to show for it but bags under your eyes from working 12-14 hour days. Salaries are 30% below market rate, absolutely abysmal compensation packages. Management is completely incompetent, they like to look good to senior management, and take credit for other people's work. The turnover is ridiculous! People are quitting every few weeks.
Advice: Step up and get your hands dirty. Stop delegating all the work while you sit back in your cushy office. NEWS FLASH: your employees are job hunting in their cubicles because they hate working for L'Oreal. Show some real leadership skills, and stop throwing people under the bus. Create an actual development plan so that people can actually have an idea about what they can aspire to if they're silly enough to stick it out with this joke of a company.
Pros: Benefits package is generous
Looks good on your resume
Lots of paid company holidays
Free products and great product discounts

Cons: No job security as a temp. When your contract is over and is not extended, they show you the door. Substantially lower pay than regular employees with the same job function. And it's hourly, so if you're sick or the company has a day off you get zip. Often assigned grunt work that the regular employees don't want or don't have time to do. No paid holidays, no retirement contributions, minimal health benefits. Not really "part of the team"; you just come in in the morning and they hand you something to do. Seems to be a general feeling of temps being in a lower class than regular employees. It's little things like not getting the free flu shots, no discount at the company store, and even the lab coats for the temps have a patch with the name of the staffing company instead of the L'Oreal logo.
Advice: If you're going to have temporary labor, at least try to make them feel like they're contributing to the mission.
Pros: Great name to have on resume. Get to learn a lot. Employees generally very nice.

Cons: *We are so big and have to create ways of working and rules that don't suit everyone, but because of our size we cannot do it any other way 
*The company recruits Passionate people who go above and beyond and at times too much which leads to unhappy people but we don't know how to help these individuals find a better balance
Advice: Continue to work on leadership behavior to go further, quicker
Pros: *I work with the best teams in the business.
*I am encouraged to go above and beyond and reviewed fairly 
*We are guided by a set of Principles that encourage everyone to act within the boundaries of ethics behavior
*I get paid to do what I love everyday

Cons: very "French" culture, tests your limits in a sink or swim type of environment.  Constantly put on the spot to see how you will conduct yourself.  EXTREMELY long hours.  salary seems competitive, until you divide that by number of hours clocked in each week.  high turnover rate = very little team stability. you're constantly adapting to new team members, reporting to new bosses, etc.  You're identified early on as a rising star, a failure, or middle of the road.  If you're deemed middle of the road, you're internally dismissed.  good luck getting any love or support from the executive team or HR.
Advice: None
Pros: incredibly fast paced environment. so much to work on that you'll never be bored. you're working with some of the smartest, most ambitious, highly capable and creative people in the industry.  a lot of ownership of your launches, opportunities to present your ideas and concepts.  great place to network and establish relationships beyond l'oreal.

Cons: Horrible blame central culture where no one wants to be accountable. Horrible work life balance. No one cares that you stay 12+ hours to help get things done. No one even gives you a thank you. Hard to learn things because people so focused on getting things don’t the understanding behind it us diminished. All they care about is making more products at the expense of your livelyhood. On top of it the raise was insulting and lower that cost of living. Didn't even cover the raise in my rent. The bonus that was “guaranteed” was 3% of our salaries and a complete joke. If your a technical person and want to go somewhere you can learn this is not the place. If you want to do well for yourself in live save yourself the stress and work somewhere else.
Advice: Stop blaming people for things going wrong. People should work together to solve problems not against people. Reward good work and employees and get rid of the dead weight which there is a lot of.
Pros: Fast paced environment.  If you work in a plant you get access to a lot of discounts which can be nice but not worth the stress of this work environment.

Cons: I have been in the cosmetics industry for over 10 years and have never encountered such a toxic atmosphere. 

L'Oreal fosters a pervasive culture of disrespect. Despite most employees being friendly and helpful, there is an undercurrent of tension at all times due to impossible workloads, tight deadlines, micromanagement, and managers who snap at the slightest provocation. You will quickly dread coming in to work and feel anxious, like you're walking on eggshells, at all times. No matter how diligently and quickly you complete your work, it will never be good enough. Chronic high stress and favoritism create a needlessly charged, political environment.

I witnessed multiple employees breaking down into tears at the bench and contractors working many extra hours for which they were not paid. Otherwise friendly people turned catty and hypercompetitive under the pressure.
This is not normal company culture!

 There is a reason most employees here are recent college graduates. Anyone with experience knows this is not normal and does not tolerate the abuse, and those who are initially duped escape at the first opportunity.

Do not work here unless you enjoy feeling overworked, exhausted, and unappreciated.
Advice: The top-down pressure is unsustainable.
Pros: Brand recognition, nice to have on resume

Cons: Zero work life balance
Unreasonable expectations
Advice: I waited several months after leaving to make sure I still felt the same way. I have put in 10+ years with L’Oreal and in those times I have watched L’Oreal go for a company that use to value their employees to one who’s expectations of their employees are unobtainable. During my last couple of years at the company I would put in 60 to 80 hours per week, and was consistently told over and over again that that was insufficient. Additionally the company seems to have adopted the mindset of bullying employees under the premise of meeting KPI‘s. L’Oréal does offer a very genuine generous vacation policy however you’re expected to work during your vacation and if you don’t management will be addressing the situation when you return. I think I am one of the lucky few in that L’Oreal has an unwritten policy that wants certain employees reach a certain age, approximately 60, they tend to start weeding out the older people. If you are young and looking for something that looks good on a resume L’Oreal will be good for you, however it would be to your benefit not to make it long term.
Pros: Free goods
Decent benefits, 401 k, Health insurance

Cons: I work in the Research & Innovation (R&I) and this site is extremely politics.  Every where is politics, but this place is the worst you can ever imagine.  You don't get promoted for your contribution, but politics.  It has the highest turn-over rate compared to Manufacturing, Corporate.. and sadly management and HR just don't care.  Be careful when you do an outstanding job-  Normally it would be promotion right? WRONG, when you are too good at what you are doing, management will keep you in that position because who can perform like you if you are promoted?  Just talk to others who work in the R&I and see if what I say is wrong.  HR at the R&I site is really a joke.. They just look "pretty" with titles like directors, managers, and are completely useless.
Advice: many suggestions were given to management and nothing changed so why bother?
Pros: stable job, decent health insurance

Cons: They work you like a dog and your best will never be good enough.  You have to kiss or lick some serious a** to get a promotion even if it is well deserved.  "Don't trust HR", if you meet someone that tells you the truth about the company....this is the first thing they will tell you.  HR plays employees against each other and have spy's all over the place.  They also gossip about everything that should remain confidential.
Currently, their is  a new president that cares less about the employees.
Advice: Do your job just like the people under you do theirs!  Don't hand off your work and then take all the credit for it and just because your old and have no life doesn't mean that your employees live the same boring lifestyle.  Also, look up the meaning of confidential; it should help you to be discreet.
Pros: Perks:  Fee goods, benefits, and some of the people you get to meet

Cons: -Reactive and not strategic or forward looking 
-Unorganized and indecisive 
-Poor prioritization - everything is hot/urgent, but that defies the meaning of priorities 
-Terrible work/life balance. Expect to work many weekends and late nights every week. Expect this to be far worse during meeting prep. Recent headcount reduction has worsened this issue. There is a huge lack of resources, especially for a company of its size. 
-Lack of females on executive committee (5 of 15). Ratio is far skewed to males and french. There is a clear ceiling if you are female and American.  Not one member is American. 
-Feeback can be given many times to HR without progress.
Advice: None
Pros: -Very smart individuals 
-Rule breakers and fast paced 
-Excellent creative eye
-Decent compensation within beauty but inferior to CPGs
-Ambitous, but to the point of delusion/lack of logic

Cons: L'Oreal needs to put less emphasis on tenure. Politics are everywhere and can muddle projects and frustrate you. Sometimes important decisions about work policies or projects can come out of the blue from France and completely change the course of what you are working.
Advice: Be sure to guide your team through the challenging politics that can happen during the course of development. Be willing to grow employees that have potential.
Pros: Your experience at L'Oreal USA can vary depending on your management team. Overall, management is receptive to your ideas and can help you work through challenging issues. The projects can be interesting and challenging. Lots of pride comes from working on big brands and seeing your products in the market. The company is striving to be more green from the production factory level down to the labs and facilities.

Cons: New manager director every year, expectations are not feasible, horrible if any pay raise, very low bonus, horrendous plant manager that walks by every team member ignoring them and not saying hi, good morning etc.. Upper Management has their priorities all wrong.. Micromanage to the highest level. Most if not all supervisors are miserable there. Supervisors get trapped in the loreal Web finding excuses why they should stay even at incredibly low wages while being treated poorly. Most management very young with absolutely no people skills and experience. Unfortunately  people have a very hard time dealing with change even under these conditions. It took me years before I tore off the web.The culture is horrible and management makes it that way.
Advice: You have a very long way to go. Just look at the morale of the workforce. This all happened because of upper management. There is a reason people are dropping like flies.
Pros: Benefits, Still offer a pension, the union workforce (non-management) Experience of manufacturing and lean manufacturing

Cons: Work long hours because senior management is unable to develop a long-term strategy or focus on a few, important launches. They continue to change their minds right up to the last minute and therefore often times launches are delayed. There are also not enough headcount/resources to get projects done. Because they want to keep overhead low you get interns managing large important projects! They have instituted a 1 year non-compete to try and ebb the continuing outward flow instead of fixing the real internal issues which cause people to leave. Most time new hires will come in full of enthusiasm only to be broken down after a few months on the job.
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits - 401k, health care coverage, gym membership, company store discount

Cons: The aggressive and political culture of L'Oreal quickly took over this fun, friendly, entrepreneurial company post-acquisition.  It is now rife with politics and presents a challenging environment for both pre-acquisition employees and Seattleites who are not used to or familiar with New York-based culture.
Advice: If you plan to keep this company in Seattle, consider opening yourself up to adoption of Seattle's corporate cultural norms.  You'll have MUCH happier employers and less turnover leading to a more successful business (as it once was).
Pros: Fantastic products, great benefits, and lots of career opportunity with L'Oreal if you are open to moving.  The products have a cult following and there is significant innovation.  Provides a different spin on the beauty business than traditional skincare and cosmetics.

Cons: The politics and posturing is suffocating.  Too often that leaves people who are incompetent in positions of power and influence that are in way over their heads.  And the good ones get left behind and have to suffer in the meantime.  Creativity gets stifled.  Dubious subjectivity drives personnel decision-making.  If you're an employee, HR is not to be trusted.
Advice: Culture is pervasive and not easily changed. Be more objective in your assessment and don't just take care of "your friends."  Embrace all kinds of diversity of thought and background.
Pros: A very good learning experience especially if you are at the beginning of your career.  Will have to be prepared to deal with the downsides to get the benefits.  There are pockets of good teamwork.

Cons: There is a much higher focus on getting new, fresh-out-of-school hires than retaining current staff.  Once you pass your 90 day mark you do not hear from HR again.  Employee satisfaction did not seem to be important.  They are following the typical "more work with the same or less # of employees" model, which is frustrating.
Advice: You will save $$ in the long run by analyzing your growth and resizing departments.  Most departments need 1 or 2 more headcount to account for the recent acquisitions.
Pros: Loreal is one of the last large corporations I'm aware of that still offers pension, matched 401k, they just started offering paternity leave. There are some great people and some not so great, but my team was very solid.  Work is never difficult but there's always something to do.

Cons: Some of the branches are very strict and have no union to help employees. Would still be working there but the branch i worked for which was in Clark N.J. moved out of the country to Mexico, and I was laid off.
Advice: None
Pros: They pay very good. They hire with in the company first then outside. It is a very good company to work for, fair in their treatment of their employees. The Company gave parties and bonuses at the end of year. Always telling us of new product launches keeping us involved one way or another of the launches. Giving us free products, and other things like jackets with their name on it t-shirts to help launch new products, and things to help in our personal lives like bringing a dermatologist into the company to check out any employee that wanted it.

Cons: 1) not much of guidance from manager, basically you have to auto pilots everything
2) teamwork spirit is pretty weak here. everyone is doing their own things
3) can be quite routine after many years of working, as the organizational structure is very flat. once you got promoted , you are still doing the same old things just the title is different.
Advice: 1) need strong and visionary leaders to pull the team together
2) increase chances of  internal transfer and cross country transfer opportunity
Pros: management gives you the flexibility to work on your creativity and implementation 0f new ideas. this is very good for people who enjoys freedom of working and challenging environment. glam , glitz and fun place to work with. the company is willing to groom and send you for training .  very good foundation for freshie!

Cons: The hours can be very long, and the intensity is never-ending.  After a long time at the company, I needed a break, but I know they'd hire me back if I wanted to go back.  It's still a very male-dominated company, even though there are females in upper-management.
Advice: None
Pros: Because it's a French company, L'Oreal USA gives out better benefits than a lot of other US companies, including a few weeks of paternal leave, and 13 holidays a year, which are not part of your vacation/sick pay.  You can have frank discussions - arguing (not fighting) is acceptable because its your job to work towards the best direction for the company.  Free makeup/skincare is a great perk

Cons: -Hourly employees are just there for their shift then leave with no regard for whether the job is done, whereas salaried employees stay insane hours and never seem to leave - no work/life balance whatsoever
-I felt guilty simply putting in 45 hour weeks because I felt like I was not putting in enough time
-Bags were checked at the door for stolen products (showed lack of trust), and samples could only be obtained at the company store
Advice: -Feedback was very positive throughout the internship, only to have a rather negative final review hit me by surprise
-Management was too busy to help out when I needed any help or pointers
Pros: -Great product discounts (in company store)
-Clean manufacturing environment
-Very competitive salary for an intern
-Employees were generally very happy with their jobs, so the atmosphere was great overall

Cons: Finance operates like a boys club. Innovation and dissent are not valued. There is a complete lack of communication and planning that leads to unnecessary hectic deadlines. Analysts do the bulk of the work and some upper management - mostly those that have been there for eons- act like cogs in the machine. Because we are a marketing based company finance has little influencing power and often have to sign off on launches and promotions that we know will fail.
Advice: Make finance an equal partner in the company's decision making. Ensure that upper management is pulling their weight.
Pros: L'oreal is a well respected global company with many brands. It is great to have in your resume. If you want to learn marketing this is the company for you.

Cons: The next month will be my last days at L'Oreal. During my four years, I have been struggled, battled the culture of L'Oreal USA.  I have learned much everything in one year and after that it has been a routine. One of reasons that I stayed in the company is because of job security( at the time, i did not have any choice). Great people working together as team but poor management. Poor management has been a problem which is the cause of high turnover, many  left the company including  pe
ople in my team. ( people stay for 3-4 years).
L'Oreal culture is not for everyone and  it all depends on your Manager  and the group to be succeed.Otherwise, It can be a nightmare
Advice: None
Pros: Discount store, 401k benefits,  training, internship opportunities. Good company for entry level positions.

Cons: Toxic atmosphere in some departments -- all depends on where you work.  In my case I walked into a bad position that had a bumpy history with previous people in the job and high turnover.  Too much drama for me so I didn't stay.  But maybe that was just bad luck.  Overall if I'd known how toxic some other environments would be that I worked in afterwards I might not have thought it was so bad and hung in there.  I think it's just a crap shoot depending on your brand / department / position at the time you come on board.  It is a huge company though and can be political.  The perks make up for some of it.
Advice: None
Pros: Salary, good perks (1/2 price on products across all brands and some free every 2 months, quarterly bonus gifts, subsidized cafeteria, etc)

Creative Atmosphere

Some great brands

Cons: Always dealing with change, product launches move, new ones added, budgets cuts, etc. Sometimes hours can be long but generally there is a good work/life balance. Some "corporate" mandates don't make sense for all brands.
Advice: Continue to bring products to market in innovative and creative ways. Don't ignore "old" products and only focus on new launches. Do not make corporate decisions that effect all brands without some level of flexibility, particularly when it comes to technology and vendors.
Pros: Very employee focused, promote from within and provide great training. Some brands allow for great innovation in product development as well as marketing. The communication between senior management and general staff is strong and reassuring. The exposure to trends and the ability to leverage them is encouraged. Each employee is offered specific training in whatever area they are working. The bi-annual review process encourages development.

Cons: The company decieded  that the retail division was not something they needed.  As everyone knows in merchandising, the retail level communication between the store personel and management and customer is sooo important.
Advice: The retail level is one of the most important aspects of the company. We are the eyes and ears.
Pros: Awesome company to work for! Excellent rate of pay! Tons of free product!! Love it! Loreal has a world renowned reputation. The product is in almost every home in some way. It was a pleasure to work for the company. I would return at any time ! The hours were flexible. As long as the work was completed, I could service at any time. Division meetings in Dallas and Houston were fantastic!! Five star hotel accomodations, all meals paid!! Lots of knowledge about product!

Cons: Work/life balance can be challenging; and as I benchmarked myself against colleagues with similar education and work experience, I found I am not being paid what I'm worth. Senior management can be very tough to work with, as there are several difficult personalities that make you wonder how they were able to excel in the company.
Advice: Foster an environment where poor attitudes from senior management is discouraged. Pay employees what they are worth if you want to retain talent long term.
Pros: There are great opportunities to grow and learn within the company, it is very much dependent on networking, and having key people in senior management go to bat for you. There are many company holidays and perks, and the name alone makes you very proud to work for the company.

Cons: A hard environment to work in, very fast pace, very competitive, and very little training.  The industry is tough and during financial hardships and high pressure the stress roles downhill quickly.
Advice: Support your employees and listen to their career goals.  The industry is tough and the pressure is high but remember work should still be fun and even though it is high stress try to remember that working for the number 1 beauty company should still be fun!
Pros: The best training you will ever get, they set you up for success for the rest of your life.  You need to think quickly work hard but you will be rewarded.  MGE has career paths and management will work wit you and support you if you are good and speak up.

Cons: No work life balance, very long hours that are completely unnecessary. Unbelievable lack of organization for a company its size. Upper management try to micro manage everything and take too much direction from France. Environment is not flexible and the 'work from home days' are a myth, not good if you have children. Marketing driven company with non marketing division ignored. You need to get in with the 'popular' crowd to be noticed, rather than for your hard work.
Advice: Innovation and creativity should drive the company. Appreciate those who work hard in the lower positions and you will stop losing the good people to the competitors.
Pros: Good salary, healthcare and free products. You will gain experience quickly and there is room to move up the ladder. Great place to learn.

Cons: Covid-19 has taught me this company does not care about its employees. When New York started shutting down, we were the LAST people to be told to work from home, and originally it was only for about 4 days. Finally the shut down came and we were told to WFH but were given NO idea about what a return to work timeline would look like. My team did not miss a beat in the WFH transition, and to be honest most if not all marketing jobs in the organization can be done from home. Consistently people asked about returning to work (to which no information was given) because there was a universal feeling it would be too early which turned out to be correct. We were told to return start June 29th despite an INCREDIBLE amount of employee outcry. The reasons being (based on a ridiculous email sent by the CEO) about us "not being creative" outside the office and needing to “feel and touch and smell beauty products" in order to do our jobs. Many people are upset and scared and uncomfortable and senior management simply doesn't care, and have literally been sending out what I can only refer to as propaganda about those who have chosen to return to work saying its "the place they feel the most safe." This organization doesn’t care about the physical and mental health of their employees, or the essential workers we could possibly endanger by taking public transportation when there is NO NEED TO.
Advice: Is working from home seriously so detrimental to the organization you are willing to alienate your employees? Its 2020, your inflexibility will lead to employees leaving.
Pros: Let me start out by saying that I am thrilled that (so far) I have not heard of any layoffs as a result of Covid, that can't be overlooked. The company is fast paced, and I have learned a ton in my time here and am lucky to work on a team with some really great people.

Cons: Horrible French leadership that is not visible at lower levels - but as you rise it is horrible. Inconsiderate managers who are close to Paris run the place with no affinity to the country.  They lead by fear culture and while they have tried to bring in “people centric / strategic” leaders from outside, the collective French mafia on top don’t want to let them succeed. Not recommended for mid career or senior hires.
Advice: Modernize and truly become diverse (international, gender, race) in your management.  Publish your top 100 / top 40 / top 20 executives, and ensure that they reflect the diversity of your business footprint.  It is appalling on how non diverse this company is, even in 2020.
Pros: People who are young, digitally savvy, high energy, entrepreneurial and best in beauty. Great place to intern or start a career.

Cons: low salary for the quality & quantity of work done; very hierarchical and political; very little to no respect for work / life balance; you are expected to "get the job done" no matter what the personal sacrifice is; very long hours (even weekends) and not enough budget or headcount to get the job done so you are forced to take on very heavy workloads; too many meetings
Advice: increase division budgets and headcount and salary; reduce number of meetings; value employees more and recognize all their hard work; give comp time to those that work late & weekends
Pros: good opportunity to learn and hone marketing skills in various divisions and with various products; opportunity for promotion and movement within the company; good benefits; great diverse employee pool

Cons: Upper management never comes on the floor to observe what truly goes on the packaging floor. HR management only seems to favor friends or don't advertise openings so that certain people can get the job. New HR people don't seem to care about all shifts. It's all about dayshift. Too much favoritism when it comes to people that advance to new positions or get recognized for doing something good.
New raise evaluations are impossible to meet now. So don't expect a raise or much of one.
Advice: Team Leads, Cell Managers and up need to take classes and work on their social skills in how to talk to people and handle issues with their employees. Just because people are over other people doesn't mean they should get to do whatever they want and not hold themselves accountable for the same things they get on to the people underneath them.
Pros: Decent pay, great benefits, great co-workers

Cons: - Hours can be brutal 
- Meeting-driven atmosphere can be stifling (large-scale internal meetings 1-2 times per month with senior management) 
- Human resources can be unprofessional - they sometimes favor certain candidates based on their perceptions during recruiting rather than actual performance at the job
- Can be overly competitive (also a positive, depending on the candidate)
Advice: - Take more consideration to balance work and personal life - this is spoken about, but really no action is taken.
- Need a drastic reduction in meetings - employees simply can not get enough work done in one day and also prepare 500 page presentations.
Pros: L'Oreal provides the opportunity for Brand Manager to work... 
- On a large variety of brands in Beauty
- In multiple distribution channels 
- Both in brand and product development (sometimes simultaneously)
- On market-leading brands
- Fast career progression vs. CPGs (can also be negative, depending on person)

Cons: Lack of clear expectations communicated by management makes daily work a guessing game. Success in the program depends largely on being lucky enough to be placed with an experienced and competent manager. 

Its a huge established cog company, so processes are somewhat archaic and more innovative marketing practices are rejected. Seemed very behind on digital marketing practices and I question how this will affect the business ten years down the line. 

Not a culture that promotes intelligent self starters. Success here appeared to be largely a popularity contest, where the judges were highly bubbly ex sorority girls from bottom feeder universities. Found it to be highly cliquey, although with some good people as well.
Advice: More transparency about expectations is needed between managers and interns
Pros: Fun and engaging events for interns. Chance to meet upper management. Free beauty products and discounts at company store. Given work that is atleast somewhat tied to the business.

Cons: Your workload has a tendency to get very heavy the better you perform.
Raises prior to becoming a manger are insignificant 
While it won't be directly said, being french is definitely a plus
Marketing rules the world and you will know that pretty quickly as you better become good at CYA
Advancement is ultimately in the hands of 3 levels above you who don't interact with you day to day.  I
Advice: None
Pros: The people in their positions that have been their a while have a wealth of technical and work experience to share
You are given a workload that is difficult to manage, but gives you experience that you rarely receive elsewhere in that time period
You are given autonomy for your projects until something goes wrong
the amount of holidays and work from home days are very helpful
Benefits are very good

Cons: Management could care less about employees - especially the ones they see as "disposable".  Could care less if their Customer Service Department is happy because they can always get more CSR's (in their opinion).  I was a temp but was promised they hire on after 3 months.  That came and passed, was told there was a hiring freeze but they'd hire in another 3 months.  I was told that I was first on the list and I was still there in 3 months, I'd have the job - guaranteed.  3 months later I was told the exact same thing.  Hiring freeze for 3 months, but for sure I'd be hired in 3 months...  After more than a year and a half of promises, I left.
Advice: Stand by your promises.  Treat all your employees fairly.  No one likes a company who jerks around the "little men" on the totem pole.
Pros: Co-workers were nice - although not very proactive. Tend to do things a certain way because that's the way they always have done it.

Cons: Employee survey results are getting worse, increase in low value work, poor systems, unfair and uneven promotions, cronyism, nepotism, lack of vision of senior leadership, inability to act, culture of downward pressure, lifetime employees only know how to manage by force and will never leave. I worked more here than any job before and got less reward than anywhere before. They take complaints about the culture as an example that people aren't "cut out" for it and refuse to actually make improvements to it
Advice: Manage people and teams through goals, collaboration, and communication not through pressure, constantly shifting priorities, and false promises
Pros: It's an attractive brand where you get exposure to alot of different people and challenges. You will get the opportunity to do as much as you are capable of. Pay was competitive.

Cons: Incredibly high employee turnover, obstensibly due to the fact that the place is a madhouse. "Hurry up and wait" mentality. Nothing ever done the same way twice. Constant struggle not to drown in workload. Very superficial - like the products they make, are concerned with beauty and packaging, and that applies to employees too. You will succeed here if you are pretty, and accustomed to people changing their minds every two seconds. If you're not a favorite on the fast track to success, don't expect any attention or career development. And say goodbye to your work/life balance, at any level.
Advice: I don't think my feedback would help - company is firmly rooted in its French culture.
Pros: Compensation and benefits are pretty good. Huge focus on creativity and innovation (which is great, if you're in a "creative" or "innovative" function). Some nice perks, like free products and summer hours.

Cons: Terrible leadership. It was astonishing to me that L'Oreal allowed the leadership to exist is such a self serving manner.  It is all about making top management look good at the expense of the employees in the field that make it happen.  Each sales person was basically told "You can be replaced".
Advice: Bring in LEADERS; people who know how to inspire teams of people to achieve both the company goals and the development goals for the employee.  There is a lot of talk of development, but when people in leadership positions have no idea how to lead people, and it is ALWAYS about the manager, achievement cannot be sustained. They do not know how to sustain consistant growth through their most valuable assets; their employees.  L'Oreal needs to really look into the leadership in Skinceuticals.  On paper, they may be showing numbers, but those numbers are at the expense of much higher profit that is being lost by the inefficient leadership.
Pros: Only one is the products are very good. However, management is terrible.

Cons: Mixed messages from Senior management, lack of transparency in talent management. The squeaky wheel gets the grease - too often, the complainers and those who are willing to step on others are the ones who are rewarded.
Advice: Walk the talk. If you are truly committed to move away from old school top down management where the most minute decisions are made at the most senior levels, you must be closer to the mid level and junior levels to the organization - not just once a year. As long as it is still ok to publicly humiliate employees during meetings with the CEO, any efforts to change will be useless.
Pros: Fast pace, solid benefits, people who are passionate about what they do in all divisions and functions.

Cons: Senior management is trying too hard to control ALL aspects of business and hence taking all authority away from employees that are in positions where they should be able to make decisions. And to top it all off, Senior management is now forcing all Director and above to sign new longer term non-compete agreements. Essentially forcing people to stay at a company even long after they should have made a move for their own benefit and for the company's.
Advice: Back off, give the people you've hired and cultivated more power to influence the business they are responsible for---. Don't lead with a dictatorship-type style. This is not the same company that everyone enjoyed working for 3+ years ago.
Pros: Benefits are good. Co-workers are smart.

Cons: slow to promote (saw qualified people being passed up for promotions for no reason), ridiculously long hours (14hrs a day on the regular), micro managing bosses (VPs had to approve and review every little item), poor attitudes all around (not sure why anyone stayed there-they all seemed to hate it), complete lack of autonomy, no transparency and lots of secrets between cross functionals, lots of focus on placing blame rather than moving on and solving the issue, long nights spent updating 800 page decks (of which only 4 slides would be presented). Overall terrible experience
Advice: give your employees more autonomy-they are smart qualified individuals and should have some power to make decisions. show recognition for wins and successes-constantly overlooking these things leads to low job satisfaction. Allow your employees to use their benefits-it was awful having to make excuses to actually leave on time for summer fridays or use your work from home benefits.
Pros: free makeup, invites to cool parties

Cons: Image matters more than substance throughout the entire company.  A bunch of well-put-together airheads walking around acting catty and cliquey.  If you're not French you're at a huge disadvantage and looked down upon if you work closely with colleagues or have a reporting structure up to people who are French.  
 Capable and effective people are overlooked for promotion in lieu of people who are pretty or whose only talent is internal political brownnosing. Marketing at this company is not REAL marketing, it's taking orders from Paris and seeing how best you can plug European products into American shelves.  Marketing at L'Oreal USA = merchandising.  Managers throughout the company are horrible to their employees because the tone at the top promotes such behavior.  You're expected to constantly be working and personal time seemed to be considered sinful and lazy.
Advice: None
Pros: The perks of the job were nice (company store, expense accounts, etc)

Cons: Decision makers take far too long to make decisions, company is too big and bloated to be agile in an ever evolving industry.  You can work like a dog and no one will notice unless you're a favorite.
Advice: Make decisions and share visions, stay a course.  Value the employees who don't kiss your butt, yet put their blood sweat and tears into their projects.
Pros: Looks great on a resume.  Opportunities are there you just have to hang in there work hard and fight for it...or be a favorite butt kisser.  The health care benefits are what keep me here.

Cons: Very heavy meeting culture, very strong involvement from Paris, not a lot of empowerment at lower levels unless you work on a small brand.  Hours can be very long and culture can be unpleasant - really depends on the brand you work on and the management.  Talent and dedication not always rewarded.
Advice: Cut down on the meetings and delegate more to the teams.  Better work life balance.
Pros: Great brands.  Lots of opportunity for internal movement as they own 30 or so brands, most based in NY but also opportunities in California, overseas and elsewhere.  Passionate about beauty.  Biggest beauty company in the world.    Good company discounts so you can hook up all your female friends with product.

Cons: Mean Girls meets The Devil Wears Prada meets the most cliquey part of your Middle School lunchroom. If you're in, it is cutthroat to stay there--people say and do things you thought were only in the movies. And if you aren't in, well, its time to start looking for something else, there's a long line of folks waiting to take your place. 
Crying is part of most people's weeks--if they have time.
Advice: You can't give advice to management. What are you crazy?
Pros: Great brands. Good place to have on your resume. If you are part of the in-crowd budgets and access are incredible..

Cons: Terrible work life balance. Long hours and terrible raises for all of the projects  you are expected to manage. I have been here over 9 years and the salaries for the new employees who come and go after 2/3 years are better than what I’m making after my long hours and years of dedication   Getting tired of broken promises of more money that never seems to
Make it into my paycheck. 1.5% yearly raise just ya colutting it anymore.
Advice: Pay those employees what they deserve for the long hours and dedication they have shown LOreal through the years. Bring in
More headcount to help us who are overwhelmed.  Share the wealth.
Pros: A lot of training ops for new employees

Cons: Incompetent leadership is rampant and people are often promoted even without the skills required to perform the job.  Its very much a popularity contest.  Career development is very weak especially outside of Sales and Marketing with very little room for advancement.  The organization is very inconsistent from one Division to the next, so some people may luck up with a great manager out of a bunch of rotten apples.
Advice: Get competent and strong leaders in place to improve the morale and performance of the supply chain teams.  Address employee concerns quickly and provide feedback regarding career progression during mid year and year end reviews.
Pros: Great products, Summer hours, cafeteria, location
Supply Chain Processes well developed and great systems to get work done

Cons: Hours can be long at times. Extremely corporate-style red tape. New, innovative ideas are usually thrown at the wayside until some other brand does it. At Loreal, you react to new innovations/what other brands are doing, instead of being proactive about it...
Advice: Be open to new ideas and change, even if you can’t see the vision at first.
Pros: Depending on the team you’re in, you’ll either have an incredible time at Loreal or feel like you’re in hell. Personally I think Loreal does a great job at being extremely transparent and ethically motivated versus other large corporations in the same industry. You really need to be a “go-getter” in any team you’re in, otherwise you’ll lag behind. Culture is not for everyone but you just have to find your own way and stick with it

Cons: - Environment was very competitive and employees were not friendly at all.  It was a cutthroat workplace.
- Management was horrible.  Salaried employees stayed until late.  There was a never-ending list of things to do and stuff to finish.  Also it seemed like no one ever got promoted.
- Intern work consisted of sending products / organizing the product closet / keeping inventory / etc.  I had to ask for more work because it was so monotonous.
Advice: Treat people better.
Pros: - Name
- Perks (free things to very discounted items at the company store)
- Worked on big accounts
- Worked with vendors one on one

Cons: The pace is fast and this is a marketing driven company.  As a member of operations I was hit with a lot of do-loops going around and around each time marketing changed their mind.  This means a lot of hours and a lot of frustration.
Advice: It is easy to feel undervalued when the hours get rough.  Unilever salaries are competitive and their hours are much better.
Pros: You have lots of opportunities take on great responsibility even at very low positions like analyst.  With that responsibility comes an opinion - you're expected to have one and the important people actually listen (sometimes).

Cons: The manager I worked for was very rigid, didn't share extensive knowledge about the company with employees, and generally only gave negative feedback to employees.  Other managers were not at all like that person - it was a fun and interesting place to work.
Advice: Keep up the quarterly employee appreciation events for employees.  Continue to company store for employees - it was great to buy Lancome products at a 50% discount!
Pros: Working in Sales Support gave one the opportunity to try out new products before they became available to the public.  At the time, we were also given credits every two months to use in the company store where Maybelline's parent company's (L'Oreal USA) products were sold to employees at 50% off the retail price.

Cons: It's a "Culty" environment of behind the scenes deals and "Old timers" network. Difficult to navigate given nobody will commit to a strategy or even a pathway. The 20 year veterans do not care about employees. Jobs are over titled with overall administrative duties. There is little to no strategic work. Everything comes from one person. The senior management needs to be changed out with OUTSIDE talent to change a network of "Buddies".
Advice: Bring in some new leadership at the top, in multiple areas. Stop tolerating executives that behave unprofessionally. Actually use performance reviews, coaching and integrated systems to improve the business.
Benefits are good...Pay is VERY low.
Pros: Great Brands, Great Benefits, Free Goods,Nice NYC location near Grand Central.

Cons: As a senior sales executive, you may feel handcuffed.  Senior management give little to no latitude for you to make decisions without approval.  So you run the ball in and have no flexibility to deviate without going back to get approval.  Basically, despite your tap dancing and making suggestions, you have no authority.  If you want to be trusted for your experience and creativity to solve complex negotiations and business decisions on the spot, forget it.
Advice: Your good, you could be great if you'd let your sales team off the tight leash.  Your people are talented, but are afraid to make a decision.  Not the best way to develop customer partnerships.
Pros: The food, hey it's French.

Cons: Culture is very blame-centric: the first question asked is not "What is the root cause?" it's always "Whose fault is it?".  All positions are paid well under area and industry average.  High turnover.  People are moved based on positions needing filling, not career path nor consent.  Management does not support direct reports; it's a "classic dynamic" of management doing little, delegating everything, taking credit, and pointing blame.
Advice: None
Pros: Fast paced, always engaged, never boring, lack of prior experience does not deter from moving into a new position.  The "blame game", "if you aren't sprinting your losing", continuous firefighting culture fosters some of the best comradery and friendships amongst colleagues.

Cons: People are promoted and given direct reports based on personal, cut-throat performance rather than leadership &amp; managerial experience. Little emphasis on training to improve people development skills. This results in a web of terrible managers across the organization and miserable teams who have little opportunity to grow and excel. There's a reason so few people last more than a few years here.
Advice: Listen to your lower and mid-level employees. Train all people managers and let go the ones that can't improve. Stop protecting people based on their years at the company.  You're hurting everyone as a result.
Pros: Free products, good health benefits, sexy industry, name recognition of company

Cons: Opportunities in balancing life-work for employees, making decisions can be slow and too much politics sadly. Even with great diversity, the inclusion programs have long way to go.
Advice: Invert the pyramid ,,,on top the clients, then employees, then managment, then upper management to see the reality and no the results they want to see.  Also create more programs for inclusion of people, accepting individuality and people that think different.
Pros: Eco environmental conscious, innovation, great organization, hard working to focus in its goals, well paid after couple of years and good performance. Good diversity. And a healthy competitive environment…good diversity policies

Cons: L'Oreal's work/life balance is very large issue within the company.  It seems as though very few people last more than three years before they've ever had enough or move on to another better paying opportunity.  While the pay is extremely competitive in general, when in context of NYC--it does not go very far.
Advice: Develop practices to keep talent instead of burning them out
Pros: L'Oreal is a respected company in the industry.  Peers in beauty and brand management understand that the company is a fast-paced, high intensity, results oriented atmosphere.  In terms of one's future in a related industry, L'Oreal U.S.A. will be a beneficial experience.

Cons: Managers do not have the slightest clue how to manage.
Unprofessional attitudes
Unhelpful employee hotline. Do not expect to get any work conflict resolved
Low pay and overworked
Management never follows policies but expect everyone else too follow
Management abuses authority. Uses other employees for management faults
District managers careless about new ideas to help improve sales
Specifically in my job they were racist and would accuse the certain customers for stealing
Advice: They should start observing their management carefully. They should listen to the associates that do all of the manager's work since they are the ones gaining profit for the company. Their employee hotline needs to resolve issues on the spot and not let their employees live under stressful work situations. When you guys say you give raises do not call  it that when it is nine only. What kind of raise is that?
Pros: It gave me experience to put on my resume.

Cons: It's too French. You only get promoted if you're in the "club" and have networked perfectly if you're American. Leadership is non-existent. Nothing is good enough, and expectations set are unrealistic. You are treated as a commodity if your title is below Director.
Advice: Stop treating your people like they are expendable. Remove the terrible French management and run the Purchasing Department with real leadership. Promote those who deserve it, not just the French employees, and remember it's L'OREAL USA, not Paris.
Pros: You get free goods and have a decent level of autonomy. If you have a good manager, which is hard to come by, you can do great things and are protected from the negative attitudes of never being good enough. But that just means your manager is most likely taking the hit instead of you. The divisions are better to work for out of the corp. supply chain office.

Cons: - No structure for promotions as a result no growth
- No clarity on who makes the decision
- You will be doing work of 4 people
- Very stressful. No work life balance
- Leaders are not leaders they are managers. Speaks really nice but no action. 
- They need to be trained on workload management and people development
- Outdated systems makes you spend more time on low value manual tasks
Advice: - Focus more on employees. Recognize and motivate them
-  Invest on tools. Correct system issues first before you vision anything
Pros: - Pension plan
- 401 k match 4%
- Profit sharing
- Free products worth $80 every other month 
- Nice office
- It’s a group. Good to have on your resume

Cons: The marketing mentality takes over the research spirit and consequently hinders innovation. The leadership style within the company is very top-down and too autocratic. A significant portion of the workforce tends to coast and nothing is being done to address it. The meeting etiquette leaves a lot to be desired (late start, attendees showing up late, unclear goals).
Advice: Create a performance-base company culture, give more autonomy to local teams, balance the roles between R&D and marketing
Pros: Company has prestigious brands, marketing and manufacturing capability, shows commitment in sustainability and environmentally friendly products. R&D is one of the biggest in the industry.

Cons: - brutal work life culture. New CMO is aggressive - resulting in over 40 people leaving or getting fired over the past few years. The few that can handle the abuse get promoted instantly
- totally ok for people to yell or scream at you when they are angry
- very normal to see people crying even VP's. It's a tough culture
- International moves are a pain and almost never happen. Senior roles are dominated by French males
- they have a 12 month non-compete. so if you are interested in beauty, you can never leave
Advice: None
Pros: - You get promoted quickly . There are 30 year old SVPs and senior leaders Promotions on CMO team can happen every 6 months, so it's a great way to move up. It's not about experience or seeing something through. Movement is quick
- great brands and perks
- always doing or trying something new

Cons: Senior management does not recognize subordinates work
No balance between work and personal life-managers do not support much if you have to work from home or leave early. Feels like an hourly employee. If you come at 7am, got to leave at 4pm or later not even 15mts early
No opportunities to grow until you move to New Jersey or New York City-not much growth
Advice: Respect and help subordinates who deserve to grow
Pros: Reputed organization with they owning brands Armani, Lancome, Ralph Lauren also they give every other month $65 so we could purchase L'Oreal Products from the company store!
Good benefits-They have very good selection of 401K
Good pay scale-They pay above average

Cons: Senior management tends to be demotivating. In addition, it's hard to get projects approved since there seem to be an inordinate number of people involved in each decision. As others have noted, work-life balance essentially does not exist here, unfortunately.

People at all levels are encouraged to be headstrong and at times belligerent, which is surprisingly often considered to be a strength. The most unfortunate thing actually is that a substantial portion of the workplace feels this way and puts up with it to be within the beauty industry.
Advice: Try to look at best practices from well-run organizations. Accept the fact that the company is doing many things poorly that should be significantly retooled rather than just swept under the rug.
Pros: As others have noted, it's pretty good on the resume, particularly if you are very into the beauty industry. It will make you tougher. Advancement is indeed possible.

Cons: "Organized Chaos" is a value here. If you are accustomed to a more analytical and process driven organization this is not a great place. I often find myself wondering what could be accomplished here is we made a decision and stuck to it. Difficult to move around and be promoted depending on which part of the organization you are hired from.
Advice: Create better career tracts and advancement opportunities. We lose young future executives by pigeonholing them and not offering better opportunities.
Pros: The company is willing to give young people a high level of responsibility with limited prior experience. You interact with many talented people on a day to day basis.

Cons: Depending on for which team you work for there might be a lot of pressure and really high expectations, which I personally don't mind but for some people this might not be the right environment to work in.
Advice: Reward interns for their hard work. Communicate goals and achievement more clearly for motivation. Interact more with interns. However, in general I have to say that I was very satisfied with the Management team at L'Oréal.
Pros: Very dynamic company. Great learning experience. Interns get a lot of responsibility and autonomy, which increases learning. Besides, everyone is very friendly and helpful not just within teams but also beyond brands and sectors.

Cons: You will work (and I dont exaggerate), 70 hours a week. I often left my office at midnight only to have my crazy boss email me while I was headed home. Management doesn't care. They only fear Paris leadership. Everyone else are nobody's in their eyes. I left after a short time. Every recruiter I told my story laughed and said I must have been the only one not to know how bad the culture is there. Sad that it's accepted by everyone.
Advice: Respect your employees. Your business is being taken away by you know who... Earnings are already showing it.
Pros: The name. Outsiders love it when you send your resume out. It's all smoke and mirrors. Use it to get your next job. Then again, nothing is worth the abuse...

Cons: - Work/life balance can be a challenge
- Lots of layers to get through to get to a decision
- Not a lot of emphasis is placed on turnover by sr mgt which results in a lot of great employees leaving the company
- Below average people management skills from middle to senior managers
Advice: Place more emphasis on managers to develop strong leadership skills to drive retention. Constant turnover can and have hurt the health of the brands and business.
Pros: - Great benefits
- Fast pace culture, change is always on the horizon which keeps the work interesting
- Fun brands if into cosmetics and personal care
- Lots of promotional opportunities if located in the east coast

Cons: Very fast pace and the work load is very heavy. It is very hard to have a healthy work life balance when the expectation is to get it all done. Compensation conversations are hard to have, what has been decided is pretty much what it is.
Advice: Understand how the growth in the company affects the workload of the existing team in order to distribute the work properly - for a better balance of work/life as well as success in projects
Pros: They allow for you to make your own decisions/opportunities. Also a lot of opportunities to change roles within 2 years. Most individuals are really great to work with and help with solving issues. Many new initiatives to help with the overall company culture - just not all implemented in the manufacturing sites

Cons: Atmosphere built on disrespect
Promotions are given more on who you know than what you've accomplished (i.e., results)
Sr. Mgmt doesn't care about it's employees
Zero work/life balance (no place to work if you're married)
Be prepared to work, at minimum, until 9 PM most nights and past 11 PM a couple nights a week if not longer (a few all nighters will happen.....yup, just like you were in college)
Advice: Better planning and focus can help eliminate, or at least reduce, the number of hours spent at work.  Treat others as you would like to be treated.
Pros: Learn marketing from the best
Thinly layered so you will get exposure to Sr. Mgmt often
Great company name for the resume
Discounts at the company store are pretty good

Cons: L'Oreal likes to do more with less resources. It's a great company to work for, but you need to have a sense of urgency and time management or you will definitely feel stresses. I personally like fast paced and challenging environments, so this is a perfect fit for me.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay and benefits! L'Oreal is always looking at reinventing itself and is rolling out a new culture of Smart/Simplicity. You can feel the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit in this location. As an employee, you will be treated fairly and with respect. I couldn't ask for a better company to work for! L'Oreal North Little Rock has strong  culture and is very people oriented. It's not only about developing your technical skills, it's also about your soft skills.

Cons: Long hours. Managers give extra work for no reason and doesnt help the bottom line. Lots of extra busy work to make sure it "doesn't work" before actually working on something that DOES work. NO room for growth unless you're in marketing. Some toxic people in upper management. L'Oreal should implement a test to employees prior to becoming a people manager - some are just NOT fit to be a people manager....
Advice: Give the directors and below more autonomy to make decisions! Remove the toxic people in upper management (the ones who are NOT fit to be a people manager!!) to give their direct reports an incentive to actually grow in their role.
Pros: Lots of great benefits. There are some really intelligent people you get to work with.

Cons: -Regularly worked past 9pm or more
-Meetings for meetings for meetings....
-Described as 'organized chaos' by upper management
-unclear direction, little support 
-minimal training
-Bare minimum of employees- consultants/interns are blindly performing most of the work
Advice: A complete reevaluation of how to carry out projects and improve employee morale. For a company with as much presence as L'Oreal, it is remarkably disorganized and alot of buzywork is done without an understanding of their brand image and consumer view in the market. Employee work/life balance was non-existant. It is generally understood in the industry that L'Oreal is a difficult place to work, and most max out at 2-4 yrs before moving on to another company
Pros: -Good opportunity to work in the beauty industry
-Global market exposure
-Interns are included on all aspects of the department

Cons: Nepotism
Secrecy
Lack of information sharing
Cut throat competition
fear of upper management
Micromanagement / pettiness
lack of life/work balance
still operating with the 1950s mentality
huge disparity in compensation
dead end careers for most Americans
absence of team mentality
lack of training
Advice: what advice? unless there's all new management, nothing will change. The culture must stem from the L'Oreal France culture which considers L'Oreal USA an American sweat shop. Any initiative is done for PR purposes and not for the good of the employees or communities,  and the management clings to their positions only out of monetary compensation.
The whole corporate atmosphere is built around fear of humiliation. People are treated as juvenile delinquents and trust is a foreign concept. Most cherished are titles and not humanity.
Pros: Good benefits
Good peers
Some educational opportunities
Decent pay

Cons: Leadership can be autocratic at times and meeting intense. You will need to hone your political navigation skills to work at L'Oreal, and don't  expect work-life balance. This company has no agility when it comes to speed to market.
Advice: You have an amazing talent pool... you need to listen to them. A more collaborative leadership style is needed with the ability to trust your teams in order to make quick decisions and move forward before the competition.
Pros: L'Oreal pays competitively and rewards high potential talent. They also provide diverse opportunities for growth. L'Oreal believes in promoting from within. You will experience all facets of the beauty business and are exposed to all levels of management. L'Oreal also offers rich career and leadership training.

Cons: Pay for FTEs appears to be consistently below market for the region, even considering benefits like pension. Don't expect to be appreciated by upper management unless you are in a highly visible sales or marketing role. HR seems more interested in seeing how little they can compensate you, rather than what you are worth in the market.
Advice: Value your talent more; they are the company's lifeblood, and if you aren't willing to compensate them enough to retain them, you'll have bigger problems. Don't just pay lip service to how much you appreciate their work, then undervalue them year over year.
Pros: On the whole, some really excellent people work at Clarisonic. The engineering groups have some very talented engineers that do great work. Work/life balance is very good in some divisions, depending on your manager.

Cons: The salaries could be higher. Since it is a French company, most decisions and ideas come out of France, it would be nice if more innovation came from the US labs. There also seems to be a high turnover rate for many positions.
Advice: There should be more growth opportunities for employees that aren't French and better communication between marketing and R&D here and in France.
Pros: A great place to start a career, it is a very young environment. There are a lot of opportunities for networking and you can learn a lot about the consumer products industry. There are also nice benefits and good working hours. There are opportunities to move around within the company as well.

Cons: As someone who joined the organization externally, I wish I received many of the benefits the HR recruiter touted— education reimbursement, career development, and a strong reward system. To my dismay, none of these have proven to be true, and management has proven time and time again how much they don’t care about employee’s aspirations, and career development. For starters, management does not see the value in a graduate degree as its deemed unnecessary to perform your job. Employees that work hard are not promoted, but encouraged to move laterally within the organization. Promotions are given to employees on a system called favoritism by the management— there are many employees in positions at L’Oreal that make you question how they got into their respective positions of influence. Qualified candidates are rejected multiple times from internal roles, and given excuses that discourage them from applying/ wanting more for themselves. Instead these hard working employees are given more job responsibilities, with no title increase, or any incentive. In many ways, L’Oreal limits their employees potential, and creates a toxic work culture. There are serious organizational problems that start with a completely inept HR department that breeds mistrust and is overly political— more so than any other company. HR is completely useless at L’Oreal, no real understanding or care for the employees well-being, a poor, unresponsive resource for employee questions/ concerns, and very inauthentic. HR shares the same generic script when questioned by employees, and are poor about following up with candidates/ responding to e-mails. HR also is terrible at career planning and helping candidates make the next steps within the organization. L’Oreal does not listen to its employees, nor does it take into consideration their well-being. For example, L’Oreal offices are one of the only companies in the NY/ NJ tristate area to go back to work amidst a pandemic. This was communicated with barely any notice nor was their any transparency. L’Oreal also did not provide adequate resources for employees to work comfortably from home, and has proven throughout this pandemic how they do not put the safety / wellbeing of employees at the forefront of the business. I would strongly urge any candidate to rethink working for L’Oreal— it is truly a demoralizing environment that makes you question your worth and career.
Advice: Abandon archaic processes/ ways of thinking. Listen to employees thoughts and concerns- work on continuously improving processes. HR needs severe restructuring and improvement. Practice what you preach- show authenticity to breed trust among employees. Change reward structure to promote talented employees. Begin investing in individual success this will turn into a collective effort for company success. Organizational culture must be improved- treat all employees the same regardless of location. Be more respectful to internal candidates time and development. Invest in employee education and support aspirations- this will only make the employee more committed to the organization.
Pros: Free Goods, 401k, vacation, flexible work, product portfolio

Cons: The company and industry is gender skewed, leaning heavily towards the females and gay men, who make up the majority of the brand managers and marketing people. However, most sales people and top executives at the company are straight male. 

As mentioned in the pros, your experience comes down to the brand you choose and your "fit" and unfortunately, if you don't "fit" expect to be marginalized.... very quickly!  (After all this is a company that is majority female and gay male... bitchiness is usually the order of the day.) Also, the brand's culture will dictate your "expected" work ethic and if people (your senior managers, etc.) are staying in the office until 11:30pm because they have work to do, then they expect you to be right there with them, even if you've finished everything you've been asked to do.

Unfortunately, you can run into some really really terrible people at the company as well(I know, I know... this can happen to you anywhere you choose to work). However, these terrible people are a special breed and if they are in a leadership position it is high-school all over again as they develop cliques of sycophants. This doesn't happen often, but i've seen it happen, and it's quite sad (and kinda funny) to see and hear your co-workers constantly gush over the boss as though she were the head cheerleader... (come on people!).
Advice: Advice to leadership would be to identify the brands that have the happiest employees, and see if you can emulate the cause for the happiness in other brands.
Pros: The company is the most prestigious in the beauty industry so it's great to have on your resume. Depending on your title/function and the brand you work for it can be really rewarding. What is important is that you speak to as many people as possible about the culture of the brand (SERIOUSLY!) before signing on to a brand as the cultures vary GREATLY from division to division and (most certainly) from brand to brand. Working for Redken for example, expect to find a younger group of hip and trendy New Yorkers who are allowed to come to work everyday in jeans, and can expect to go to sales meetings in Hawaii and Las Vegas. This differs from L'Oreal's CPD division, where employees get a lot of hands on experience working with major money-making brands, do a lot more quant based work (scanning their Nielsen numbers every 2 minutes) and have to be dressed "for business" everyday. 

The pay is alright (among the best in the industry - but it's not banker or consultant money) and if you do well and negotiate well you will be able to advance in your career and make a solid living.

Cons: Work life balance can be hard if you are not used to a challenging atmosphere, and it is challenging. Sometimes you don't have the resources, sometimes you don't have the buy in from people you need, but you always push through and deliver. Achieving excellence is core to how we work and it is expected out of everyone in every level and function.
Advice: Continue to promote managers that encourage feedback and collaboration.
Pros: Lots of freedom in work, and innovative ideas are always welcome, tons of product & awesome benefits ($25 a month gyms), great people, CSR commitments (look up Share & Care). 
If you are a high performer and are motivated to switch functions, brands, or locations you can make that happen. There are lots of opportunities to go beyond your role.

Cons: High turnover rate, management has little technical background, no sense of team, all major formulation comes from France and are riddled with problems. Projects get dumped on your desk with no support from original formulating lab. The plant consistently makes processing mistakes and blames the formula. Zero focus on formula quality. Removed from the rest of the industry and does not really promote joining organizations like the SCC. Restricts checklists meeting with venders and using new materials.
Advice: Bring people into management with a technical background. Most managers don’t understand formulation.
Pros: Opportunities to move around, great work/life balance, nice people, great salary and benefits. Flexible work hours. Some WFH days offered to even lab workers

Cons: Work life balance is horrible.  The culture itself is where the true problems begin.  The employees have either worked for L’Oreal their whole career or do not even last a year.  To say turnover is problem is an understatement.  HR allows people to be bullied and treated poorly and everyone uses the excuse of “that’s just the L’Oreal way”.

My advice would be if you even slightly care about spending time with your family or you care about your mental health, do not work here.
Advice: Just do better.
Pros: Great pay and benefits, as well as brand recognition.

Cons: Inefficient in a lot of aspects - still lots of room to make things work faster and smoother
IT is nowhere close to cutting edge
More work than there are people
Advice: People development needs to be part of the culture...saying we are doing it and doing it are two different things; better work-life balance could really help retain great talent...there's nothing wrong with working remotely or from home if the work force is working,
Pros: Fantastic people & products
Really can rotate functionally which is very rare in corporate America
Best benefits anywhere
Highly compensated - especially upper levels
Sense of purpose, belief in the company, pride when telling people it's L'Oreal

Cons: POLITICS
Promote based on favorites vs. merit
high turnover- no stability or regard for process; every few months its like ground-hogs day working with a new cross-functional team from the ground-up
no worklife balance- weekend and midnight emails are normal
Advice: Learn how to do the execution work of the people below you before you sit in meetings and overcommit or backstab your own team. Company needs to focus on training, mentoring and recognizing success in new hires to improve retention.  Across the organization teams are held back from progress due to constant turnover and employees starting in a role without knowing how to do their jobs or how to navigate the company culture.
Pros: Autonomy
Fast Paced
Dynamic
easy to move between functional departments (it's even expected)

Cons: God forbid you challenge someone from upper management your job automatically goes on the hot seat. A lot of turnover seems like once you hit 40 it time to start watching over your back seen some really smart people let go for know real reason other than they were older than most of the rest of the team
Advice: Show more respect to your older management. We are all going to get older someday
Pros: Good benefits stable job weekends off hours are not bad except when there's a deadline  for something which should be expected they tend to panic

Cons: It's an American outpost of a very French company so you need to join the company with a desire to navigate the subtle and sometimes overt cultural differences and language barriers that can pop up.
Advice: Continue to modernize and Americanize the company.
Pros: L'Oreal USA is full of passionate and creative people working at the top of their game. It's a place where you can quickly make your mark. If you have a good idea, you are given authority to run with it. Opportunities to work on a global stage are a big attraction. L'Oreal is a company that invests in and empowers individuals. It is always striving to innovate at every level of the company.,

Cons: A lot of stress 
Very little "caring" between employees
Work comes before collegues always
Stressful atmosphere due to the competition between everybody
Heavy workload and few people to do it in the communications and public relations team
Communications team should be more integrated with marketing teams
Management is not always supportive
They work you to the ground and not great work life balance.
Advice: Make it more about the people than about the money.
Of course, money is important in a business, but if you focus on the people and make sure that they work very hard but in a sweet atmosphere, they will give even better results.
Pros: Very well organized teams with a very firm schedule every day
Clear vision of what should be done for the day
Great discounts regarding L'Oreal products
A lot of responsibilities during the day
Very few "i don't know what to do" moment
You will be rewarded if you perform outstanding results
Great atmosphere and collaborative team.
Amazing products to work with
High energy
Great education programs developed internally

Cons: Work-life-Balance does not favor the 'family' person. $ Compensation is generally not commesurate with responsibility.  Management exremely slow to adopt change, particularly in information systems.  Very political atmosphere.  French business culture is embedded everywhere at the senior ranks, difficult to function if you are not used to it.
Advice: Break the traditional mold of what brand equity is supposed to be.  Give the consumers what they want, seize opportunities in this 'new' economy.
Pros: Better than average benefits and great maternity package.  Good experience and exposure for young professionals, particularly in Marketing.  If you can conceive of an idea, prove it's financial sustainabilty and champion it's cause...your career can take off here.  New CEO is a different thinker than previous 2.

Cons: MicroManaging: Serious issue( I called" MM") and very common at Loreal.  constant mentally abuse from upper management until their employees leave voluntary or in bad terms. No one since to care including HR and put a stop this nonsense .
Burn Outs: Regretfully, very common  and happen short or Long period of time depends of Individual healthy physiology. 
Working/life balance: Adjust your personal life and work can be manageable  but  without family even better  and less stressful.
Culture:  aggresive fast pace environment(in a negative way) ,the most of time unfeasible deadlines, very robotic, chaotic, disorganized( 2nd biggest issue). The meetings tend to be long and repetitive: quantity and no quality.  Communication among Workers-Upper Management- Marketing, is defining  an   painful  cycle , most of time with intangible  solutions. Generally, friendly environment with few backstabbers. Frequently, handle disputes and disagreement,  Any of these disputes, if not resolved, could cause lost productivity at best; at worst, it could lead to employee resignations or bad performance review. 
Revolving Door:  Leaving  totally normal,  an universal needs such as eating, breathing, sleeping etc. Every 1 or 2 month someone leaves behind  the door : come in with happy, excited and motivated attitude & come out  delusion, hopeless and emotional daunting/haunting experience
Career mobility in a political  hierarchy;   Upper management acceptance+ fast learner+ Charisma+ hard worker+ adaptability=Promotion, high responsibilities  and international training. Lack of these attributes or inability to perform could cause  a reversible failing career reaction.
Advice: Advice to Newlywed (interns):  Great company to gain experience in the field of cosmetics for a short period of time. The company treats very well all interns,   working with important projects and giving a lot accountabilities, being integrated  with all departments. You get paid.
Advice to Experience level workers( acquaintance) : I would not recommend you to work in here. You will/ might have to change your modus operandi  and live up to  the standards.. Sense of Logic is not a strong forte at Loreal.
Pros: Free goodies every 2 months, a lot holidays, good benefits, modern and high technology, paid training classes,  leader company in cosmetics and good name for your resume. On the other hand, career advancement only depending on your manager and fitting  on this type of culture.

Cons: Severely lacking retention policy.  The benefits package is good upfront, but the raises and salary adjustments are far from competitive compared to other companies in the industry.  Most chemists used their position at L'Oreal as a slot on their resume, and after 1 or 2 years would leave for something significantly higher in pay.  Additionally, while there is some mobility where you can change roles or departments, it's a double edged sword in many cases.  A manager can change from one technical department to an entirely different one, without any background knowledge or expertise in that area.  As a result, the people under the manager greatly suffer from a technical development standpoint.  Additionally, with the research area at the mercy of marketing, many projects are cancelled or funneled into continuously recirculated products from different brands that only have small changes made that have no real effect on perceived performance.  Unless you're on one of the transient groups that are in the front of the line in terms of company visibility (in today's case, the global technology incubator group), you're either stuck in complacency at your current position and barely moving, or you're swimming on the wrong side of a work life balance... just to get a skin lotion or shampoo out onto the market that's hardly innovative (even though the company loves using the word innovation to describe adding things like adding protein or honey at tiny percentages of less than 1% to already existing frame formulas and calling it new, or deconstructing competitor formulas and trying to replicate it for their own).
Advice: Address the cons above, and actually try to do something about employee dissatisfaction instead of just doing a bunch of surveys and having kumbaya meetings where people just vent their problems without any solutions being proposed or implemented.
Pros: Good benefits package overall upfront

Cons: I work in a support group for R &amp; I.  The Building in Clark is depressing.  Dark, no windows unless you're an AVP and I don't mean you don't sit near a window I mean you have to go for a walk through the building to go see if it's night or day.  The building five feet over underwent a multi million dollar renovation but don't feel like you're allowed to step foot there to sit in a nice cafeteria and look at sunlight, you're not. And they've been saying the building we are in is going to be renovated too (for the past ten years.)  Most of the people in my area sit in their cars during lunch just to have access to sunlight for an hour.  Walk through the parking lot between 12-2 and you'll see people sitting in their cars, that's how depressing sitting in this building is.
 You can work from home 2times a month but in comparison to places like Coty, Estee, Revlon (once a week), or smaller boutique brands (extremely flexible), or Pharma it's not much.  L'oreal still runs like it did in 1970 (and looks like it too).  I assumed and always heard the benefits would be great but I ended up having to pay $80 for the same bloodwork I had gotten done for free at an annual every year, I rarely go to the doctor so i can only imagine what it is like for someone who goes often.  
L'Oreal claims flexibility and advertises how many women work there but their maternity leave is just about the minimum required by law..I think you get 2 extra weeks but compared to newer companies (and the Paris office) this is nothing. 
Most holidays are normal, unlike Pharma you have to work the day after Christmas, even though no one is in the office, it's a strategy to make you waste your vacation days to spend time with your family during the holidays.
Support groups are blamed for everything.  We're basically the whipping post of L'Oreal, it gets tiring but stay long enough to put it on your resume, gain experience but don't hold your breath for a decent raise.  Everyone's raise was &lt;2% in my department, this is the norm. We were also told the company had a great year but our profit sharing was the same as when loreal has had negative years. So try to negotiate in a minimum raise as well.  If your review is all positive how can a company justify such low raises? Do your time, fill your resume, leave in 3 years for at 15-20% jump.
Advice: The workforce isn't the same as it used to be.  If you want younger people to stay you need a nicer workplace and more flexibility.
Pros: L'Oreal as a whole on the highest level is a good company. Although, if you're in Paris it's  GREAT company.  They have way more vacation, more flexibility and work from home options, and maternity leave is significantly longer.  It's a solid company where you can learn a lot and insist on work life balance. They do surveys to get feedback and try to implement changes but with such a large organization, it really depends on which department you're in for how happy you are or how long you'll stay.  
If you come in below a manager expect to be doing everything, it's a great learning experience but can be frustrating at times because as a "non working manager" you can put all your work on the people beneath you and essentially sit in meetings talking about other peoples work and you also get a performance bonus if your'e a manager.  I would stay at L'Oreal if I could switch departments (and buildings) which L'Oreal encourages, I haven't done it and I don't know anyone who has but I have heard it's not too difficult.

Cons: Promoting managers with lack of experience who harass the personal staff till someone resigns from their duties. Must never report any confrontational Manager- issues to Human Resources;HR won't convey a healthy solution  and the most of time they will ignore  your petition. salaries Increase  1-2 %. and average  promotions are between 3-5 years. Aggressive fast pace environment with a non sense of logic;very chaotic.
The most employees ended up going to competitors, suppliers or changing their career.
Advice: n/a
Pros: Some perks including discount store and free goods every 2 months,volunteer time, great health benefits, good retirement plan (401 K).

Cons: Bad work-life balance. A lot of operational constraints which hinders efficiency. If you are not a management trainee entry-level employee, well, chances are you would hardly get career advancement no matter how long you stay with the company.
Advice: Please try harder to understand entry-level employees' thoughts about the company and their anticipation for their career. Entry-level employees contribute a lot more than you think they did. And please please please include BA into L'Oreal headcount.
Pros: You get to contribute a lot in a very short period of time. The fast-paced environment accelerates the learning curve. If you are a management trainee, then congratulations, you have a bright future lying ahead of you.

Cons: Exhausting- will burn you out 
People start at 8:30am and leave no earlier than 7:00pm
SInk or swim culture- you need to learn fast or sink and training is very limited
Culture- senior management will barely speak a word to entry level employees 
Everything is urgent and everyone is in a panic
Everyone is disposable- extremely high turnover rate
Advice: Invest much more in your entry level employees because they "carry" the  heaviest burdens of the organization
Pros: the brand name will positively resonate on resume

Cons: Operations HR is very unhelpful with movement and promotions
Pay is generally below industry average
Silos exist between departments and divisions
Minimum vacation days and restrictive work from home policy
Advice: HR claims they want to help yet insist employees do everything themselves to be "proactive" with regards to  moving across functions. The current system for promotions is an embarrassment to the company.

Change how you treat employees. Greater focus should be put on those who have made it clear they want to grow within  the company. Efforts should be made to retain talent. More flexible vacation and work from home policies.
Pros: Large company
Potential for travel
Potential for various roles

Cons: Glass ceiling for US employees (global HQ is located in France and the vast majority of upper management is constructed of French or International employees)

Often disorganized in ways of working

Lags behind in terms of company culture--&gt; Outwardly expresses a very hands off 'entrepreneurial' environment but is much more rigid, strict, and routine in ways of working.

Lags behind in use of technology to enhance day to day operations
Advice: Learn to change and adapt to new ways of working.
Pros: Good Retirement plan and benefits
Inclusive culture 
Great salary + Benefits
Management does well to assist career development
HR does well to present new opportunities for career changes within the company

Cons: Good for starting or ending your career, not so much if you are in the middle.  Little room to be creative, very political, very France-dependent. Project goals are shifted often, thus project managers scramble, research is haphazardly done.
Advice: Managers should have more technical knowledge in domains where they manage tech experts.
Pros: Decent salary and benefits, bonus and profit sharing, pension, good 401K match, free store goods, WFH opportunities even before COVID. Managed very well the pandemic by staggered scheduling people at workplace vs home, kept workplace sparkly clean. Meetings improved during COVID. Strong brands, superior products.

Cons: It is not difficult to spend more hours here than you intended to.
Advice: None
Pros: L'Oreal USA is a great place to work. The company cares about the community, promoting a national volunteer day, eco-friendly resources, and allowing employees to volunteer on company time. L'Oreal also affords its employees amazing health and wellness benefits. Additionally, I work on a team in which every member is always willing to lend a helping hand, and I have heard this truth resonate throughout the company. Additionally, the amount of career growth and mobility at L'Oreal USA is amazing! In my short time here, I have seen employees move across functions, brand, and even countries!

Cons: Long hours due to multiple changes in direction or simply iterations and many many meetings.  There are meetings to prepare for the meeting that is preparing for the meeting.
Advice: Do not allow a culture where it is ok to treat team members badly.  Many managers are only focused on their own growth and not that of their team members.  And actually most managers are not properly prepared to manage a team.
Pros: Large organization with many brands so a wider opportunity for growth.  Opportunity to move up fast in organization if skill set warrants to progression.

Cons: Long hours (regularly working 80-100 hrs a week). Our team experienced an extraordinarily high rate of turnover, I watched people who had worked at the company for over 5 years walk out the door and never return. There are minimal discussions about personal growth and transitioning roles.
Advice: Respect the talent that you have. There is a seemingly endless supply of potential new employees, but the gaps during transitions and constant loss of knowledge hurts smooth management of the business.
Pros: As a global brand manager, it is a truly cross functional role. You will get to work with other international marketing managers, packaging teams, research & development, creative teams and 3rd party agencies. It is an all encompassing marketing / brand management role, with ownership and responsibilities management of multiple products from start to finish.

Cons: While career mobility both vertically and horizontally is great within the organization, this translates into some unintended consequences. Due to high rates of churn, many team members may prove to not be skilled in their respective functions, thereby leading to frustration, inefficiencies, and reinventing the wheel. While people in the mid-to-lower levels are typically personable and highly collaborative, senior management is not so depending on which department and/or division you work. There are some department heads that will point blame on others and cause undue pressure for virtually no reason. In addition, politics play a big role here. HR is unsupportive when it comes to promotions so individuals are really left to themselves to create the right connections and market themselves to climb the ladder. The highest performing &amp; technically skilled employees are frequently denied career escalation to remain cogs in the machine to hold departments together.  Work is typically very manual with convoluted systems and processes that make data mining and analysis more difficult than it needs to be. To get many roles down to a standard 9-5, lots of automation would be required. For this reason, it really helps to learn macros/VBA if you wish to lower the amount of hours you work in corporate roles here. Otherwise, it is normal to work 10-11 hour a day or more on a pretty regular basis.
Advice: Do not take your top performers for granted. There is no reason for high-performers to stay with a company that underpays them for their skill-sets vs. the market rate, and denies them career movement.  Length of experience with the company also should not be considered as a factor for retaining senior management. There are plenty of senior managers in the organization that do not deserve the roles they are in either due to poor people management skills, technical ability, or lack of functional expertise. L'Oreal currently wastes a lot of time, money, and energy defending these types of managers and promoting internally, when the high-performing talent has been proven to arise from external companies. In fact, most of the folks I've seen rise quickly within the company have been experienced professionals that joined the company after 5-8 years of experience at other companies.
Pros: People-oriented culture. Colleagues tend to be very helpful, collaborative, and solution-oriented. Since this is not a process-oriented company, you have plenty of opportunities to create your own new processes and/or tools for the betterment of the organization. Given the right connections, political savvy, and good self-promotion, moving up within the organization can happen at a very rapid pace, much greater than at many other companies. For example, it is not unheard of to find VPs and AVPs in their early 30s within the organization.

Cons: Too many career decisions are made by people that barely know who you are or what you are capable of doing.
People rarely look for your opinion regarding future roles or listen when you provide the information.
Too many layers of decision making to get from point A to point B.
Advice: Create levels of advancement in Purchasing.  There's little room for advancing in the department and when you try to leave the department for other opportunities within the company there is very little if any support if the decision to move did not come from management.
Pros: Benefits are good and most of the people are extremely good at what they do.

Cons: Promotions are hard to come by if you are a field employee who is not willing to more. Work life balance can be difficult as everything is urgent and important and it never stops!!
Advice: None
Pros: The company is filled with talented people. You will work really hard, but you will grow and learn a lot. The pace is very quick, so if you are not organized, don't have a strong work ethic or don't want to long hours you will not be happy here. That being said, the company allows you to bring ideas to the table and run with them to see if they will work. Great company. I love working here.

Cons: The hours can be long and demanding with no let up.  While there is no official policy that says you have to spend so much time working, the environment makes it difficult to shut down for the day (any day).  Work/life balance suffers as a result in spite of all the attempts by the company to change things.  It is a cultural thing where you just feel obligated to put in the long hours despite official policy.  The company has also evolved from a small company atmosphere where decisions happened quickly to a large corporate one where there are layers of approval that are needed for anything to happen.  As a result, we are slow to market for any new trends.   Reporting lines can be complicated too, one example being that the major division heads (Professional Products, Consumer Products, LUXE, etc) report to the head of US and also to an international head of division.  So if the US needs extra sales to hit a target, they might want Professional Products to deliver extra sales, but that might not be what the head of Professional Products Worldwide wants.  Lots of that going on makes for some interesting situations.
Advice: Consolidation is not necessarily the best thing to do.  While it makes for easier lines of management, it makes innovation hard when you have so many layers of management (brand, signature, division, etc)
Pros: The people that work there are fantastic, some of the best and brightest that I've had the pleasure to work with.  I never had a boss that wasn't great and was given plenty of opportunities to grow (and fail) during my 20+ years there.  The benefits are great and the offices in NY are state of the art.  There is a lot of collaberation that goes on and if you have new ideas, you are encouraged to develop them.

Cons: The Union is trash. They are scared of HR They only take your money. Raises are disrespectful. No PTO for 2 years. No sick time off. Medical insurance is robbery. You pay insurance after tax. Senior workers always worrying about how many Hours of OT you work. Silly points rule they have in place. You have to beg for your certified Rate which is only $0.58.
Advice: Take care of your manufacturing employees with better benefits, sick time,  and PTO. Tell Supervisors don’t get mad when working a lot of OT. Stop being greedy and cheap with your employees. Give better raises. And tell HR stop with the dirty attitude.  Tell supervisors to treat everyone equally.  Too much favoritism and lastly stop thinking like that’s the only place of employment
Pros: Half price at the company store

Cons: Being that the senior management is almost entirely French, there is a slight lack of understanding of the US market. Nothing that cannot be overcome, however.
Advice: Invest more in technology. Laptops for all employees, better technology services, wifi on site, etc, would make a huge difference for all.
Pros: L'Oreal is one of the leading brands in the world, and it is an honor to work here. There is a diversity of brands within L'Oreal USA to work on, covering everything from cosmetics to ethnic hair care. Not only is there something for everything, generally the people are good to work with.

Cons: Salaries can be lower than average for the industry. Annual raises are low (around 1-2%), promotion raises are very small (around 5%, with very few getting higher). There are no strict rules when it comes to employee reviews. Every manager does them differently and many will rate you based on their own opinions rather than following guidelines from HR. 
Lots of politics and BS. The French rule everything and make all the decisions. If you are not French then there is little room for you at the top (most top management is sent over from France). Employee turnover rate is high.
Advice: Train your mid-level managers before putting them in that role. Don't just give a new manager a team of employees and let them figure it out - you are hurting people's careers. There should be more oversight on the annual review process and discussion before reviews are submitted. Managers should be taught how to give helpful feedback and not give BS explanations for poor ratings.

Maybe if you give higher salaries and raises your employees won't keep leaving for competitors. Show your employees that you value them and don't treat them like they are easily replaceable.
Pros: Your experience in R&D is very dependent on what department you are in and who your manager is. Some departments are doing great things with lots of innovation. Others are dead-ends where you might never get to do anything new. Quality of managers varies, some that help you learn and give you good opportunities. Others can be a nightmare with unrealistic expectations and company politics. Lots of inexperienced managers that can hurt your growth and make your days miserable. Growth can be very limited, but you can learn a lot about the industry. There are opportunities to move within the company but it doesn't happen quickly.

Company store is a nice perk, good company benefits and more holidays than most. Lots of free products. Company does other nice things like an annual volunteer day and year-end event in NYC. The culture in R&D is usually fun. Jobs are stable as very few people are ever fired.

Cons: Many areas of work are rather siloed. The high turnover at L'Oreal means working with new, untrained people all the time. The hours can be very long, and brands vary widely on how much top-down support and consideration is given. Overall it tends to be a poor work/life balance.
Advice: Management thinks they do a better job at listening from above than they do, and it is eroding the culture.
Pros: L'Oreal generally provides good salaries and benefits. There are options for growth and advancement if you are a corporate go-getter. Quick time-to-market on most projects let's you see you hard work on the shelf quite often.

Cons: -Poor work-life balance
-As with any large company, politics plays a predominant role at L’Oreal.
-A very strong ‘protect yourself,’ or “CYA” mentality.
-Limited interaction with senior management at most levels within the company.
-Usually only the most pushy or aggressive personalities are promoted to higher level positions.
-Many departments seem to work against each other rather than working with each other.
-Promotions are often based on company need and not the interests of the individual employee.
-Raises are typically low (1-2%), and the only way to get a sizeable pay increase is through changing job titles.
-Very few people in senior management that you would want to emulate. 
-Very few individuals in senior management could be described as nurturing or empathetic.
Advice: Many of the individuals in upper management can be described as having aggressive personalities and very demanding expectations. These expectations may be achievable in the short term, but in the long term will prove to be toxic and unsustainable. Further, it creates a culture in which individuals will copy this behavior because they perceive that as being necessary to be successful. Very few people in management can be described as nurturing individuals or adept to training and caring for new employees.

Management, you should create an environment where individuals will want to work with each other and not against each other. Spending one week in Arkansas working on teambuilding exercises is not a valid solution to counteract the time spent in the office where you are taught to protect yourself and your department.

Additionally, the Mid-Year Review and Year End Review processes should be reevaluated. It is not uncommon for managers to e-mail their midyear comments to their employees only to not discuss them further. Furthermore, L’Oreal should implement a Manager’s Review as well. To my knowledge, nothing is being done to rate the performance of the manager as seen by the employee. 

Raises are another issue that should be looked into. I have seen many occasions where an employee exceeded expectations on their Year End Review and received a 2% raise. I have also seen many occasions where an employee met expectations and received a 1% raise. The amount of effort required to exceed expectations cannot be justified by a 1% relative increase in salary. I believe this to be a fundamental reason that so many employees are disengaged and/or uninterested.

I see a great deal of potential in L’Oreal. It’s unfortunate that an industry leader with over $5 Billion in sales has such a difficult time retaining employees.
Pros: -Excellent health and wellness benefits.
-Good training courses are available if you know who to ask.
-Summer hours are a nice perk, although your workload will determine just how early you can leave on a Friday
-L’Oreal is a good company to have on your resume.
-Networking opportunities.
-L’Oreal has more Company Holidays than most other companies (2 days off for July 4, 2 days off for Christmas, etc.)

Cons: There is a huge division between management and the floor workers.  They have core values that they preach at monthly team meetings and when you try use them with management you will find yourself wrote up at best and fired at worst.  The plant manager is an EGO Maniac.  They move a lot of people around in the company and you can find yourself working on something with no experience or training yet they expect results.  Comany culture morale is at an all time low.
Advice: Stop being ego driven.Stop hiring simple "yes men" as your floor managers and check any documentation the yes men give you.  I know for a fact that they are changing informants before you see them.  I did my own tracking and discovered things were omitted or flat out changed.
Pros: Good Base salary. Free Product

Cons: Low compensation for long hours worked. Expectations in a field position to use your own personal resources and space (storing collateral and supplies to use and deliver on call cycles in your personal space) Low travel and expense compensation causes you to have to basically pay out of pocket to show up for work. Went from a $550 travel and expense disbursement to less than $50 in one month, with no notice. I was left to cover expenses for parking, maintenance, gas etc. that I would have never incurred otherwise, had I not been working for the company.
Advice: Compensate employees for added expenses, especially in markets where the cost of living is very high. Don't hire talent under one travel and expense policy and change it 60 days later.
Pros: Excellent benefits. Health insurance, 401k, employee concierge services, discounts on health clubs and life necessities.

Cons: Sink or swim mentally, marketing driven with no regard to creative departments contribution - an idea is only as good as its execution which is done by creative, creative is regarded as a service department working for marketing versus team mentality, high turn-over rate, marketing departments promote regularly and easily giving junior employees too much responsibility, HR protects upper management and sabotages everyone below, senior positions held by life-long antiquated employees who are not up to speed or current in thinking, lacks overall communication from top down creating last minute re-work and unnecessary long hours
Advice: Need leadership teams that are aligned with strong communication skills as groups work in silos creating unnecessary work and long hours
Pros: Good benefits, two bonus - corporate and divisional, 401k, vacation, half Friday's during summer months, free goods from corporate store that carries products from majority of divisions

Cons: Not as nimble since so large
Newly acquired companies may not be used to such a large global organization
L'Oréal may not understand fully some of the companies they acquire before they acquire them and this makes transitions/change tough at times.
Advice: Listen, listen, listen
Some of the best ideas can come from frontline employees especially ones who have been working on the frontlines of companies L'Oréal may have just acquired. It's OK to show interest in what the lower level employees have to say. In fact, it is vital for change and there is a lot of that at any company especially one as global as L'Oréal.
Pros: Big Company
Lots of opportunity
Very Competitive Wage
Excellent Benefits
Brand Recognition

Cons: They do not do retention well or seem to value their loyal employees.  Those from the outside are given better treatment and titles than those who are trying to come up within the company.  The environment is hyper political and they play favorites.
Advice: Show your loyal employees you value them by promoting and giving opportunities to people who have been in the company over hiring from the outside.  Make sure the levels on teams make sense and are clearly defined.  Lots of teams have people doing the same work but have very different titles.
Pros: The brands are great, there are a lot of resources since it is a large company.

Cons: Time off is average - every 5 years or so another 5 days are added.
Work life balance can be a struggle (but if you are non-exempt and can get overtime, they make sure you are paid for that)
Advice: None
Pros: It is a great company to grow at - they encourage their employees to push themselves to move to higher roles after about 2 years in a position.
The compensation is very competitive and the company store is a great perk.
Health benefits are great and they match a 401k up to a certain %

Cons: A culture of organized chaos is sometimes frustrating.  Few people in the company are true decision makers and some things take a while to be approved despite deadlines and urgency.  Prepping for meetings is a job in and of itself.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits (health insurance, free and discounted products) and high levels of responsibility for projects no matter what level of employment.  True business goals and objectives are set and employees are always challenged to harnass their creativity to deliver more.  Plus top management has really declared that sustainability and responsible growth are key priorities.

Very nice opportunities for mobility among the portfolio of brands as well as internationally.

Cons: Poor management, no upward mobility, poor work recognition, no support from management. High rate of turnover and FMLA due to high-stress work environment and micromanaging. Some managers are disrespectful and will call you out in front of everybody instead of using a private room. Lately, the environment became toxic.
Advice: Take the time to know your employees and treat everyone equally. Publicly reward and recognize hard work. Show your employees they matter and they’ll do their best work for you.
Pros: Health benefits, holidays, diverse culture and backgrounds, some great employees

Cons: Dysfunctional management - inconsistent (some members of management are very good and some are very BAD) This created a lot of frustration
Lack of professional behavior during meetings (screaming, yelling, crying...)
Many people have 'catty' attitudes
Not for everybody
Advice: If you actually followed your performance evaluation process (the one that HR has on paper) for promotions you might actually have relatively competitive people managing the NYO office. But, since promotions are very political there are many inept members of management that makes every body else's life miserable and create a lot of inefficiencies in the process.
Pros: Free product perks
Fabulous location in 5th Ave.
Looks good on resume
Interesting industry
Amazing advertising

Cons: Long hours, several projects at once with unrealistic timelines, marketing changes minds all the time and management does not care. Raises are 2% when you exceed! 1.5% when you meet expectations. Why work so hard then?
Advice: Push back on marketing for feasible timelines. True salary increases based on tru performance
Pros: 401k, benefits, profit sharing, company store, and community service opportunities

Cons: Work/Life balance does not exist.  Low salary which is why many young (and older) individuals leave.  Also, promises of promotions rarely come true unless you work for the RIGHT person!
Advice: Raise the pay scale, offer one day minimum per week to work at home (instead of twice a MONTH).
Pros: Lots of knowledge acquired while working here but I have seen many young people walk once they have the experience under their belt and the L'Oreal name on their resume.

Cons: Some very lazy and apathetic employees with no motivation. Quick changes with marketing, lack of database for records and procedures
Advice: Continue to empower the employee and hire good engineers. Let innovation projects drive the company forward because it the competitive field, new products have to make a splash.
Pros: Large international company with diverse products, brands, and technologies, creams, emulsions, hair color, skin care, moisturizes, sun blocks, fragrances, mascara, foundation, nail polish, hair gels. Forward moving company embracing technology, mobile it, and new trends. Very friendly and hard working people.

Cons: Constant changes of direction, decision making is only top-down. Not nearly as glamorous as you would think, even brand managers do a lot of grunt work. Endless hours spent on ppt presentations that amount to nothing.
Advice: Have more confidence in the employees, and start getting on the ball with interactive marketing!!
Pros: Household name, excellent benefits, and free products. Working with some of the best marketers around and products that will be seen and used by millions.

Cons: Work life balance. Part time job without penalty of losing benefits a huge point of dissatisfaction. Work from home policy and flexible options in the stone age. Lack of clarity re: future progression and movement into next roles a big negative.
Advice: Improve flexibility options for working remotely. Work life balance still a huge opportunity for L'Oreal. Need for greater clarity on promotions, leadership opportunities and promotions!
Pros: People, people, people. Creative company with great passion. Room to be who you are. Room to fail and you are still valued.

Cons: Long work hour, unorganized, missing breaks, ackward laboratory enviroemt, favoritism, Manager is very partial, I would recommend stay away If you are looking for better opportunity, work life balance is worst.
Advice: They should focus on quality laboratory how chemist work, Too much work pressure and not able to take any breaks except 30 min lunch breaks, no appreciations, they don't have proper training programs for new comers. It is totally mess. I would seriously request ma agent to look in this.
Pros: pay may be , employee certificate gift.

Cons: The workload at the end of each month was rediiclous. work short hours all month. then the end of the month comes WE GOTTA MEAT ARE  QUOTA for the month. why not just plan ahead and work a few 9 or 10 hour days once a week instead of mandatory 12 hours all week.
Advice: None
Pros: enjoyed the people that I worked with on a daily basis. I also enjoyed working on my on  projects a as well as in a group setting. The management team was nice to work for.

Cons: Not very embracing of diversity. Not quite Meritocratic - You have to fit a "certain" mold and make it into the "favorites" class or unfortunately you have little to no career growth opportunity.
Advice: Standardize your people/career management system to mitigate the negative impact of unconscious and conscious bias. This will help to make L'Oreal a great place to work for ALL truly talented people.
Pros: Offers great opportunities for career growth with promotions possible even as quickly as 8months in. 
Great products and benefits.

Cons: *Management seems indecisive, changing their minds often
*Dynamic, fast-paced industry = higher levels of stress & more challenging assignments
*Longer hours
Advice: Think longer term, and set the strategy.  Revisions to the strategy should be made carefully, and not in a seemingly knee-jerk fashion.
Pros: *Opportunities to work on everything from tactics to overall brand strategy
*Wide variety of projects
*Exciting industry and amazing brands
*Lower level employees are asked for input
*Passionate workplace
*Located in the heart of Manhattan

Cons: A racist, sexist, misogynistic environment that breeds hostility, fear and terror. Reporting of the above mentioned to HR makes you feel like it’s you that had the issue. In their immersion into the company, I’d like to call it brainwashing, they tell you that Americans are peaches, on the outside and hard on the inside; the French are like coconuts, hard on the outside and soft on the inside. Why I didn’t run away from this company sooner I don’t know. Oh wait they make you sign a non-compete where no one can hire you.
Advice: Fire them all or I hope the entire company goes under.
Pros: Nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing

Cons: Not everyone fits. You have to be adventurous to succeed here....nothing is ever set in stone...the network is more important than the processes. There are very little guidelines and few directions are given.
Very fast pace. Hard working required but it comes with the satisfaction of being part of a winning team.
Advice: Come live the life of employees one day per quarter
Pros: Incredible career opportunities
Early exposure to management and Business challenges
A lot of room for personal impact...a place where you can make your mark
A place to grow professionally AND personally
The people are Amazing

Cons: Pay is very low for the work/effort displayed by office employees 
Yearly pay raise structure is very, very minimal and at times can be very frustrating.
Advice: Work on a better compensation strategy
I love, love my job & working for Loreal but the pay & raise structure makes getting a second job a strong possibility. I may not be able to afford the job that I love & that's disappointing.
Pros: Excellent corporate values
Strong benefits package
Great atmosphere 
Great managers

Cons: Countless late breaking changes, seemingly weeks before products are supposed to launch. Unrealistic expectations for sales, SKU, space goals.  Many, many layers of management giving contradictory direction...execution, as a result, is quite difficult.
Advice: Eliminate a layer of management.  We don't need VPs reporting to VPs reporting to SVPs reporting to two layers of presidents.  

Stick with timelines on product development. 

Keep the expectations once these changes are made, but not before.
Pros: Lots of innovation, huge marketing spend behind new product launches...lots of ammo for sell-in.

Cons: There is a perfectionist culture so you can’t make mistakes or you will be bullied and blamed. There is fear of making mistakes so you do all your best to try to avoid them or otherwise management will blame you and have zero tolerance. Too many emails late at night from your bosses and toxic environment. I would not recommend this place to anyone that wants a work life balance or just period enjoy coming to working. People are very competitive and not helpful. There is no training and it’s either sink or swim mentality.
Advice: Please re-invent the culture. It starts from above!
Pros: Health benefits, free goods, summer Fridays

Cons: You have people in leader ship positions that don't know how to lead or manage. The mid-level management is worse. They hire people that don't have any management experience or any coaching experience.
Advice: Do real check-in's with your employees and follow through on career development.  Hold your senior management leader team accountable for what they say and do.
Pros: They have an excellent benefit package and offer a great vacation and personal time

Cons: I probably would not want to work there past interning. There is little work/life balance and it seems like it takes years to advance within the company.
Advice: 
Pros: L'Oreal is a great place to intern because you really get a taste of the industry as opposed to being a coffee runner. Having L'Oreal on my  resume has impressed other companies I have interviewed with. If you are willing to put in long hours and hard work you will get a lot out of an internship here.

Cons: If you are want to retire with the company: make sure that you have a masters, continue your education, and continue to move around through brands within the company.  Stay inside in the NY office.  You will live your job, but if you can manage to survive the benefits when you retire are amazing.
Advice: Talent, dedication and commitment should be rewarded. The french culture is very unique, but only Sr. Management is exposed, however the negativity tends to filter to the field.
Pros: L'Oreal is an amazing company.

Cons: Expect to work long hours. The working environment is very stressful. They preach core values but do not live what they preach. Upper management is the worst for culture and morale.
Advice: This goes for plant management in Florence, KY. Practice what you preach. You are the biggest problem with the organization. You paint a false picture of the plant and culture to those above and below you.
Pros: Good benefits, opportunity to learn and perform different job positions. Opportunity to transfer to many locations around the world to fill open positions.

Cons: L'Oreal tends to not hire contractors for permeate hire positions. Contractors don't have access to internal job board and aren't invited to the company picnic (but co-ops and interns are).  Just seems like upper management doesn't care about their contractors.
Advice: Treat your contractors better. They are working hard to insure that the labs are working efficiently and to the best of their abilities and we can't even get invited to the company picnic.
Pros: Great first job for someone looking to break into the personal care industry.

Cons: Some people get unmerited advancements.  A lot of people riding on the coat tails of others.  Some management trainees are incompetent and not given right opportunities to improve.
Advice: Stop focusing on playing the number games so much.  Don't just focus on top players.  Keep supporting people in their ideas.
Pros: Great growth opportunities, even when not merited.  Pleasant place to work.  Management that cares.  Relatively low pay for engineers.  Management trainee program gives quick career advancement.

Cons: Forget about any work/life balance in certain departments.  You will work day and night and many weekends, especially every month end.
Advice: Create realistic expectations to facilitate a reasonable work/life balance for all employees.
Pros: Great people to work with.  Great benefits, including a pension which is almost extinct these days, and generous holidays and vacation time (when you can use them).  Decent salary and bonus, depending on who's your manager.  If you're always willing and able to relocate, and work day and night, you'll have more job security and can probably climb the corporate ladder too.

Cons: Horrible culture. My manager would almost always use inappropriate language during meetings, was rude and had impossible expectations. Would usually take out frustrations on me. 

Culture was very French, and not knowing French/having an understanding of how the culture/its hierarchies work was a disadvantage.
Advice: Hire more people and spend more money on resources....too much work and too little time. And stop caring so much about appearance.
Pros: Challenging, Fast-paced, Great exposure to management, and you are Entrusted with lots of Responsibilities

Cons: Very long hours, overly competitive culture, way too many formal meetings that take up time from doing the project work
Advice: Give people more flexibility in their path upwards.  Don't assume that someone staying until 11pm is doing better or more work than the person leaving at 6pm.  It's about efficiency-judge people on the work not how long they are sitting at their desk.
Pros: Smart people, lots of opportunity, good brands, challenged to work above your level

Cons: Because I am the go to person and work with various groups to find root causes to the complaints, I am pulled into various other projects. To me, it is very important to prioritize my work and make sure nothing is neglected. However, I love helping out my co-workers in coming to conclusions or meeting set goals.
Advice: None
Pros: In my position, there is high visibility and I interact with various groups (both internal and external) in tackling complaints. I am involved with both packaging and bulk related complaints, which makes my skill set very unique at the company.

Cons: Marketing has too much influence in the scientific testing process which affects the quality of testing results.  So many meetings that it can be hard to get work done. Not much room for growth as an objective scientist. Measuring parameters that are almost completely subjective, like 'beauty', 'radiance' etc is an impossible task, which leaves no way to objectively determine how good the product is. Plenty of brown nosing.
Advice: Reduce the amount of meetings you hold with your core group.
Pros: Good benefits. Good job security.

Cons: Global IT department in France is only concerned about controlling all IT services and not the quality of service that is provided the employees.  When you run into issues there is no means to resolve directly and you must wait until the Global team wakes up.
Advice: US management needs to take a close look what is happen inside IT
Pros: People below VP Level in IT a nice to work with, pay is okay,  big corporation, location, nice office, good bonus, international partners, travel opportunities. CIO changed recently.

Cons: Management overly focused on education level rather than proven experience.
Management can block transfer requests and occurs frequently to protect resources within team.
Salaries are not competitive with other Research & Development shops.
Infighting and political battles between US R&D & French R&D teams, leads to toxic (at times) environment.
Advice: Look to employees first, then open reqs to the general population.
Create better JD & Career path
Look at compensation to make more competitive.
Pros: Good benefits, 401k, pension, health.
Co-workers were intelligent and fun to work with.
Large company could provide opportunities for growth (depending on manager).

Cons: It can be a difficult culture to initially acclimate to and you have to be comfortable with a lot of ambiguity, but once you get it, it's great.
Advice: None
Pros: L'Oreal really has the best of a small company coupled with the stability of a large company. You are an active player in your career development, you have the ability to customize your job scope to fit your interests, and you are encouraged to explore opportunities within other parts of the company, other brands, other specialties, etc.

Cons: Very political and rigid. Catty and rude behavior is rewarded, which can be disheartening. It takes a certain type of person to truly thrive at this company. If you don't fit the right L'Oreal image, you will have a tough time. You definitely have to have an incredibly thick skin to work here.
Advice: None
Pros: Great brands that are interesting and well known. The salary is good and the benefits are great. You learn a lot about the business side of beauty at  L'Oreal, which is invaluable experience you can take anywhere.

Cons: Salary has been my biggest difficulty , I feel that the hourly rate should be higher . A lot of responsibility. I take great pride in my work and would love for my salary to reflect my passion for the company.
Advice: None
Pros: Loved growing my business with the partnerships I've been so fortunate to have gained. YSL has  given me the opportunity to build relationships that greatly impacted my revenue and productivity .YSL is a brand I'm proud to represent.

Cons: Very French-centric, expatriates have a high proportion of senior leadership positions in U.S., with very few senior leadership opportunities for Americans in Europe, which is really illogical considering the relative populations you can draw talent from.    American slaves work for French masters.  Highly negative work environment, more focus on competing internally vs. externally; lack of teamwork and cooperation.
Advice: Become a mutinational company vs. a French company.  Modernize work atmosphere.
Pros: Great people and products, good place to begin a career.

Cons: - Work-life balance is extremely difficult
- Internal politics dissuade transparency
- Not many diversity networks to tap into
Advice: - Management recognizes that work-life balance is a challenge and they are actively trying to manage it. Advice would be to continue your efforts and hold managers accountable for prioritizing work-life balance.
Pros: - Iconic brands
- Original thinking is valued
- Surprisingly low level of bureaucracy
- Culture of merit-based career advancement
- Opportunity to work anywhere in the world and lots of cross-functional opportunities

Cons: If you are planning on taking up a job as a data scientist or a chemical scientist in L'oreal USA in R&amp;D, do your due diligence.L'oreal USA is a far cry from its HQ based in France. All the exciting work happens in the HQ and there is a huge disparity in the opportunities you will get to contribute and learn. The company may claim to be innovative, but that is not always true and not for many teams. Innovation means acquiring new brands and technologies, not necessarily innovating internally. Digitally and in terms of infrastructure, L'oreal is a lagging way behind.
This is probably a good company for people wanting to have careers in marketing and sales.
Advice: None
Pros: Good company benefits for full time employees

Cons: bad managers who do not care about your career development, poor leadership, very poor work/life balance, high drama (devil wears prada attitudes), crazy personalities, poor marketing training, sink or swim mentality, does not coach/mentor people, lack of respect toward personal life, high burn out rates
Advice: You must learn to retain talent - by coaching ans developing people's careers, by getting rid of bad managers who do not respect their teams, by showing that you care about the people, by letting people make decisions and be the true brand champions - or else you will continue to bleed talents like you are now
Pros: #1 beauty company in the world, great resume builder, great location, diverse workforce, fashionable people, high energy, free products

Cons: Excessively Long Hours to try to meet upper managements un-reasonable expectations.  
It is the Ivory Tower - Out of Touch Management that makes it a bad place to work and their expectations cause them to loose good people left and right.
Advice: Do not be afraid to adjust goals.  It is better to adjust goals than to loose great workers because they are over-worked by trying to complete un-realistic goals.
Pros: Good for Resume
Get to work with some great and smart people in middle management

Cons: A) Drama Heavy, a little too Devil wears Prada at times
B) Too many diva executives who don't own the consequences of the risks they take
C) Some managers who get away with treating people in an inappropriate way
Advice: Be more fact based and less accepting of emotional management.  Stay flexible and fabulous, reward passion without bullies and immapropriate managers being allowed to run rampant.
Pros: A) Lots of great people
B) Cool products
C) Lots of exciting things to work on
D) Creative people all over to work with

Cons: Very strict with rules and regulations. Supervisors are pushed on enforcing these rules so don't make a mistake. They rather let you go then to understand mistakes are human and stuff happens.
Advice: Remember people are there to support themselves and their families so keep that in mind when your talking to them. Learn to promote growth and not just the bye see you later attitude.
Pros: Good pay and benefits. Work is steady lots of overtime for those who want. Many good benefits and perks. Pleasant work environment.

Cons: No CRM made it hard to communicate client notes with my inside sales teammate.
Advice: Remember to have fun and what it took to make the company successful in the first place.
Pros: A fun team of employees always willing to go the extra mile to help customers and the company succeed. Field management and leadership seemed to appreciate the hard work we put forth all year especially during the heavy client event seasons. Trade shows were a lot of fun getting to reconnect with colleagues from across the country and meeting new and existing customers.

Cons: political, you need to constantly be advocating and networking for yourself as HR and most managers will NOT help find new opportunities or provide roadmap or guidance for your career. They are archaic with no systems so everything is in excel and pretty manual.
Advice: So top heavy, how about supporting high performers and giving them chance to advance and grow rather than just hiring more people above them. Everyone has too much manual and administrative work. Invest in some systems!
Pros: big company with good benefits

Cons: Fast paced, hectic, lack of transparency between departments, work/life balance is poor (even though hr likes to say the company loves to support all your passions).

Depending on the position, hours can be long, and learning takes place on the job. If you have other interests or need more one on one time to learn, this place nay ne difficult.
Advice: An actual training period, more staff in departments to lighten load, better work/life balance
Pros: Learn a lot about the industry, you sometimes get the chance to see upper management at work.

Benefits and compensation are very good for entey level

Cons: There is no work life balance. Expect to work a minimum of 10 hours a day ( with really no time for lunch).
The work load is often times unrealistic, especially with the short deadlines.
Due to the high stress environment you can expect snappy and often moody attitudes from upper management.
Advice: None
Pros: As an intern you are given real responsibilities and are very much an important member of the team.
You will learn so much and have a hands on exposure to many aspects of the business.

Cons: The company's culture can be challenging depending on one's personality.
Advice: None
Pros: A very competitive company on the cutting edge of innovation providing a steep learning curve in any position. The people are exceptionally smart and ambitious so one can benefit a great deal from building a strong, influential network. Needless to say L'Oreal USA is a leader in the beauty and marketing industry so work experience in this company is a great resume builder and develops skills which are easily transferable in any marketing / sales org,

Cons: Constantly changing and inconsistent policies. Its a blame culture. More important to blame someone then fix the problem. Stressful and not supportive or nurturing. Older experience people have been forced out and replaced with 20 somethings.
Advice: Not worthwhile advising, management doesn't want to hear it. Direction comes from Paris.
Pros: The L'Oreal name is well known. Work for the largest cosmetic company in the world

Cons: Office is in remote location in mid jersey
Traffic to office is sometimes heavy
Train station is not close to office
Departments tend to socialize within
Advice: Management works very well with employees, since there are not too many levels of delegation witching the company. Employee's are trusted to succeed in projects and are not micro-managed.
Pros: Friendly atmosphere in the office
Berkeley heights office is pretty new and very spacious
Great perks for full time employees, especially in the corporate store
Shuttle provided to NY office
Summer hours and casual fridays

Cons: I would give this review a 0 if I could. Unfortunately this is a very unorganized company with little to be optimistic about. There is a serious lack of strategy, professionalism, trust and strong leadership. This is a blame heavy organization that is staggered by indecision at top levels.  

Interns work endlessly but the lack of focus at decision maker levels has resulted in very few transitions to full-time work.
Advice: Focus more on development and less on favoritism.  I hope that things will improve for the people who are still here.
Pros: The company is located next to a park. There are a lot of smarts managers in the organization and the intern talent that has come through has been wonderful.

Cons: Leadership is aimless, frequently changing direction late in the game and causing unnecessary scrambling. Leaders encourage employees to falsify data in order to put a positive spin on failures, when sharing with L'Oreal leaders.  Lack of transparency to the point of lying to employees. Transplants from other L'Oreal brands are just biding their time in order to transfer to another brand. Very toxic culture. Little growth opportunity within Clarisonic.
Advice: Be transparent. Don't encourage coverups. Do not make promises to your teams that you cannot keep. Balance benefits and perks between US and International teams.
Pros: L'Oreal benefits, decent pay, parking is free, some ability to move to other L'Oreal brands if willing to leave Washington (to NY, NJ, CA, France)

Cons: By far the worst company I've worked for in my career.  Morale is horrible and has only gotten worse.  Senior management is a revolving door and has no vision for the company.  Those that came from other L'Oreal brands only did it to get promoted-just doing their 18 month tour of duty.  HR is non existent.  Long commute from Seattle with traffic.
Advice: Get a vision before this place implodes.  Be committed, don't just give lip service.  Stop the lies.  Try to actually care about your employees before we all quit.
Pros: Free products, opportunity to move within L'Oreal, vacation/PTO is fair.  Summer hours are a welcome surprise to take advantage of.

Cons: No work/life balance. Mandatory overtime and you can literally be asked to work 13days straight, the cap is 68hours weekly, yes 68hours a week. Very strict policies and sometimes unnecessary, you get points for everything. Doesn’t really feel like a family, everyone just comes to work , gets used and takes a decent paycheck.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay for the type of work you do. Very clean working environment and good for someone that wants a lot of money and wants to work a lot of hours.

Cons: Equipment is only patched, not properly fixed. Management is only concerned about production, which is hard to do because you run all shift fixing equipment. MTBF is 1.5 mins.  Only want temporary help, they do not want to hire within, know of several people walked out for wanting to be hired within.
Advice: Fix your machines, Treat people with respect, not down them for not being able to keep rate on faulty equipment.
Pros: Usually plenty of hours. Safety is a priority.

Cons: Pay is not competitive.   Team are run lean to the point of gross inefficiency and undue stress to employees.  Work life balance is non-existent without impacting your work or causing workload to shift onto others.  Political to the point of highly irresponsible decision making.   Promotions are arbitrary and based on favoritism and very rarely merit based
Advice: Decrease the politics and stick to basic principles.  Staff the teams effectively and improve profitably on the product instead of cost and head count chopping and putting the burden of your poor decision making on the backs of your hardest working employees
Pros: Benefits aside from direct compensation (health, retirement, misc fringe benefits) are good

Cons: Very caddy work envrionment and often times politics are rampant
Very little work/life balance. They expect you to work long hours, even though the pay isn't great
Not a good training program
Advice: Offer better training to new hires and provide them with the neccessary tools to succeed.

Cons: US- mgmt lacked industry competence/knowledge, much fear/jealousy/politics, mgmt used leadership soundbites but impotent, talented people frustrated,  360 surveys not entirely anonymous and retaliation was ominous.
Advice: Doing the same thing over and over in the hopes of generating a different result is the definition of insanity.  You still have many in upper management that have no desire to change, making it a futile task for those that can get the job done.
Pros: US- Good benefits/pay, relatively good work/life balance,

Cons: No work-life balance and a lot of energy goes into low value work. If sales aren’t hitting goals, life is hellish. Way too many tyrannical leaders at VP and above. Sexism still very prevalent, despite majority of female employees.
Advice: None
Pros: I had the best co-workers, the corporate office is nice and the employee store offers 50% off MSRP on all L’Oreal brands.

Advice: None
Pros: Being a part of something so iconic, globally, it is an amazing place to learn if you're hungry for it. And working across the brand portfolio provides exposure to various business types. I loved everything I was exposed to and the opportunities I was able to take on.

Cons: At L’Oreal USA, trust no one. Watch your back. It’s a sink or swim culture with no sense of trust or comradeship within teams.

Bias towards white males. 
If you are not a white French male, you will not be promoted or given attractive job opportunities as often.

HR is useless.

Leadership is racist, white and male.
Please audit why all your diverse talent is leaving the company.
Pros: There are product discounts.
Nice NYC office.

Cons: So grand, you can easily get lost in the crowd.

Cons: Absolutely no career pathing or peer reviews. Incredibly inefficient processes and slow to innovate. Almost no visibility to senior management. Late nights building decks that never get presented.  At my new job I still get incredibly anxious before performance reviews because I have flashbacks to my time at LUSA. Honestly sometimes I think I'm over my experience and I still have nightmares. Only good day at work was my last one! To those that are there know it gets better on the other side -- to those that are considering I'd recommend looking elsewhere
Advice: None
Pros: Free goods, 401K, Nice views in Hudson Yards

Cons: Lots of programs and platforms to have to learn, however everyone is willing to help get you caught up to speed.
Advice: Continue to listen and trust your employees, and communication is key.
Pros: Great environment, supportive team, wonderful benefits package. During the pandemic, the company has created a taskforce to constantly follow world news and updates with CDC protocols, so that employees can be as safe as possible. L'Oreal has shown that our health and families are important to them.

Cons: However, their retail structure felt in-progress thorughout my years there, no matter the brand. Some ideas brought to leadership were given a "I don't know how to go about that," with no follow up or with instructions to drop it.
Advice: None
Pros: Throughout their retail fronts, L'Oreal is flexible with appearance, personality, and methods as long as you drive their desired numbers. Leadership was open to new ideas, and encouraged you to own the business almost as your own. Above average pay for retail.

Cons: bad management harassment ,bullying and no human resources to resort too! inexperienced people in positions they are not qualified for. where they look to blame rather then find  solutions to the total chaos they had developed. wasting  money on a normal basis is part of the culture and replacing good people with friends from previous companies they had worked. managers they had previously LET GO were more competent then they are now!
Advice: get Streetsboro under control
Pros: L'Oreal as a whole, excellent  company to work for. good benefits great hours real pleasure to go to work for 5 yrs. until NEW management came in and botched everything up!

More focus on recruitment than retention
Advice: None
Pros: Many brands and opportunities to move around every 1.5 years 
Business is growing

Cons: The expectation at Loreal is that you are always prepared and ready to "fight" for your opinion. This is something to learn from and emulate, but at times, the work can feel combative as ideas are often laced with emotion given the nature of the work.
Advice: None
Pros: The company invests heavily in personal career development and growth within. The diversity of talent, creativity, and experience makes L'Oreal an always interesting and engaging place to create and develop.

Advice: Consider more modern management practices.
Pros: L'Oreal is a true resume builder. You work on the some of the biggest beauty brands in the world with highly visible products and campaigns. It is a great place to learn and grow. The pay is also good.

Cons: I was a contractor, therefore during holidays, parties and other common gatherings wasn't allowed to participate in any events. Although, it's understandable that since a contractor is not an employee and doesn't get any benefits, management can create something not to separate workers during sociable events
Advice: None
Pros: Was my first job after college. Managers and colleagues will train and teach you despite the fact that you are not really a L'Oreal employee. Company store has plenty of nice discounted stuff.

Cons: I don't have any cons to share. This is a company that surveys the entire workforce to improve the workplace annually. It is a privilege to work for L'Oreal.
Advice: Keep up the amazing environment and positive culture.  L'Oreal is an amazing place to thrive, where diverse talent works together in a symbiotic, wholesome organic way.
Pros: L'Oréal is a wonderful company to work for. Allow people to take initiative and make a difference every day. Incredible culture to thrive in.

Cons: Promotions are based on who likes you the most- not actual competency and talent.  There is a go to list of Favorites  and it’s very toxic. LPD and PPD are the most humbling divisions to work for. Stay away from CPD!
Advice: Stop the selective sponsoring it’s borderline racist and sexist.
Pros: You will have the opportunity to work with some great people, depending on the division you will be given respect and autonomy.  Very creative and inspiring place to work.

Cons: Bad Management practices ( favoritism, laziness, hyper competitiveness, insecure decision), dysfunctional HR , uneven workload for non management ( non management takes all the workload), bad communication practices, lack of incentive for good practices and behaviors.
Advice: Cut Management staff to necessary levels. Why do you need 2-3 managers, directors and AVP for the same department and site? This leads to complacency and bad Management practices.
Pros: Good health benefits and decent salary.

Cons: - Low pay in comparison to other companies
- Management poorly communicate with staff
- Corporate culture is toxic, with a lot of negativity

- Improve corporate culture
- Have surveys to gauge employee's insight periodically
Pros: - Great benefits
- Excellent training programs
- Looks great on a resume
- Ability to build your network with different brands

Cons: Everything about this place is a challenge. You are encouraged to speak up about making improvements to the company, but when you do you are either dismissed or harshly rejected for suggesting the idea. If you have any type of science degree outside of engineering you are considered worthless and treated as if you had no college degree. Promotion is driven by favoritism, not by qualification. Instrumentation and technology are out of date. Opportunities to get involved with the company are only available to office staff. Training is obsolete; you walk in and are pretty much told to work right away. There is no formal training or shadowing and no real SOP’s. No chance for advancement or growth in your department and any type of learning is highly discouraged. The main focus of your management is to ensure that all deadlines are met and they will push you very hard to meet those deadlines. Management will then toast their success and complain that you were not working hard enough. Your management will not work with you to guide you towards your professional goals. They will never move you if you are good at what you do because they are too lazy to find other qualified employees to take your place. The company is a revolving door especially for those with great experience and qualifications. They are fickle about time off, with rules changing with each new manager that is appointed. Management always changes policies when they are changed around.  So expect to be constantly guessing what your policies are. If you temp with the company, expect them to treat you horribly and then string you along with the promise of a permanent position.  This is a terrible place to work especially if you have a background in the sciences.  Just skip over it if you can, you will gain nothing of value to your resume other than the addition of a “big” company name.
Advice: I have no advice for management, they won’t listen anyway.
Pros: This place has no perks. All the perks they had at one time have been either taken away or made obsolete. Corporate perks are there but they don’t inform you about them at all. The overall culture would be great if they actually practiced their supposed “compass.”  The compass is a list of moral guidelines for every employee to follow. It would be great, if EVERYONE followed it, but management is exempt for some reason from this applied moral code. They have a great development plan system that is all formality. Nothing is followed through and they expect you to remain in your position forever without any opportunity for advancement unless you are a favorite. Even then, they dictate what you should be promoted too, not what you want to pursue. You get steel toed shoes from a shoe-mobile paid for every year and free goods are given every 2 months from the company store. No real interview process is in place, they will hire anyone, even if you are not qualified. Only looks good on your resume, no real valuable experience will be obtained from your experience here.

Cons: Work-life balance can be better. Can offer better commuting options to employees.
Advice: Help drive your employees career path. Support their wishes and give them the exposure to grow.
Pros: This company gives you the opportunity to take an idea and run with it. You can take on projects that interest you and really make them yours while growing them to benefit the business. Being vocal about your interests will help you know who to reach out to and learn from.

Cons: Working there really had no cons. Except breaks are short and sometimes you had to go on break alone. That kind of sucks if you like to socialize.
Advice: Try to keep a friendly and fun work environment and you will get much more from your employees. You get more bees with honey than vinegar.
Pros: Nice people and pretty good pay. very Easy to move up the ladder if your hardworking and enthusiastic. Good vacation packages and company store benefits.

Cons: Meeting-heavy culture, still very slow to innovate in many areas, too many meetings and preparation for visits for bigwigs coming from France
Advice: Encourage people to have a life more, take time off, celebrate successes, recognize teams publicly, seek diversity, convert consultant workforce to permanent
Pros: Competitive pay and benefits, moderately
Young workforce (for the most part) modern office, looks good on resume, exciting portfolio of brands, many locations around the world,

Cons: The cons are literally endless. Much of it boils down to culture. Read the reviews saying "stay away" and trust them. 

The amount of decks that go no where are endless. The data sources are questionable. Demands for decks from leadership pop up out of no where. employees are scared to leave their desks for lunch in the event management has a demand from them. 

when I was hired, HR told me i would be on fast path to senior level leadership and dangled it in front of me like a carrot in front of a horse.  however, they provided ZERO opportunities for growth, development, and leadership. in fact, any time i attended a training or event for my development, they forced me to leave to do some "urgent" work that could've been done by many others. they made me feel guilty for the competitive salary i effectively negotiated. 

leadership is flat out rude and disrespectful. i had to take a personal day to be with my father for a serious surgery he was getting. i was nagged, called, and emailed constantly, expecting me to work at his bedside. work is obviously important however that is a line that is too far to cross. management would call me at 6am demanding i send them items. management was insulting, crass, and down right unprofessional. employees are manipulative with no benefit. 

employees are voluntarily leaving in packs and management does not seem to care one bit. it is a revolving door. 

i developed serious anxiety and ptsd and saw my health deteriorate while working here. it is TOXIC.
Advice: i really don't have any. you are set in your ways and have built a culture of toxicity and enjoying the misery of your employees. someone from HR will probably write some BS note about how they are changing. you are not changing. you are hell.
Pros: Company store

You get to work with very legitimate, industry leading brands

Cons: So far I have seen none.
Advice: Keep up the great work!
Pros: I have been working at L'Oreal full-time for about 2.5 years.  The culture of the company is inclusive and very professional. The company leadership is very visionary, inspiring and supportive of diversity. Positive/energetic co-workers, flexible work schedules as per individual needs. Plenty of professional growth opportunities and a great rewards/recognition program. L'Oreal offers competitive salary and great benefits.

Cons: Poor communication, Political and it all where you are French or French Canadian, No leader ship, Everyone is scare of getting fried at all level of management other then the French connected people.  New leadership training does not work and people are afraid to make a decisions  in fear of getting fried...All decisions are make made by many meetings and political. It is like living in Communism...
Advice: Upper management should be fired and management should trust people to do their jobs.
Pros: Ability for movement in organization but not necessary upward.  Good to gain experiences

Cons: long hours, high-stress environment; can be difficult to move up if you are not French or have not worked in France

Advice: None
Pros: Driven, passionate employees. There is lots of room for professional growth, which makes it a great place to start your career because you will be given a lot of responsibility quickly. It is a place where you can be creative in any position.

Cons: Loads of work to be done, since it is a very entrepreneurial environment, it is possible that lines are blurred within different positions
Advice: find better and smarter ways to promote from within, look at the talent that they currently have and their potential, this would keep current employees more satisfied and motivated
Pros: entrepreneurial environment
oriented to the people working in the company
friendly environment
company enables you to create your own path to growth which include international opportunities

Cons: long hours
not so great pay
caddy environment
extremely small staffed teams -people are overworked and burnt out
HR is not very responsive
completely unorganized firm, good luck finding things

provide incentives for meritocracy periodically, your most talented individuals are losing incentive to stay
Pros: brand known for strong "training" program
ability to work with different brands
great location
fast-paced
corporate discount in company store

Cons: Not very much upward mobility for my position.  Communication  between departments was lacking and there was a lot of the blame game going.
Advice: Better communication policies  would have been great.  Alot more problem solving instead of wasting energy on trying to place blame.  Needed more team building.
Pros: Was a great company to work for. Excellent  benifits.  Great training seminars across all skills.  Also very safety orientated with good safety training

Cons: Everything else unfortunately. Brand changes direction without thinking about consequences. Management is a revolving door including SR leaders and those in my position. Sales goals are unattainable since there is no customer support. Lack of resources, training and exclusivity.  Lots of scrambling and hardly any execution fixes the internal issues.
Advice: Complete overhaul of internal practices, new HR that is focused on employee moral, new leaders that fulfill a vision to see it through and not be fired or quit within a year.
Pros: Good Discounts with L'Oreal brands, somewhat flexible schedule, benefits. That's about it, though L'Oreal buying out Clarisonic would provide more support but it's even more messed up.

Cons: There is a heavy Workload that could affect worklife balance
Some market initiatives such a flexible hours are being currently analized and implemented in some countries, but we are not there yet 100%
Management could be improved
Advice: None
Pros: You are free to create
In this company you can really make things happen
There are tons of ways to grow professionally. The opportunities are there to be taken
L'Oreal cares about their Talents

Cons: No cons to add.
Advice: None
Pros: L’Oreal has over 35 brands and many corporate functions to drive the world’s leading beauty company.   From these many sources comes an incredible amount of IT demand.  Sometimes it can be daunting, but it also extremely exciting and diverse.  The opportunity to learn and grow is outstanding.  The company can be aggressive with Ita IT aspirations, creating an environment where you will always be challenged.

Cons: -TOUGH culture - lots of throwing people under the bus, playing the blame game etc. to make yourself look good 
-Nepotism drives promotion/mobility

Advice: None

-Best “street cred” beauty experience, well established brands 
-More entrepreneurial than you’d think

Cons: Promotions and raises are not communicated very well prior to receiving them and can come as a surprise when you hear about others getting promoted.
Advice: The French culture is very much throughout the business and is good in terms of corporate identity. However, the pressures from the French labs is sometimes questionable.
Pros: Benefits package is great including half-day Fridays during the summer and health insurance. The average employee age is young at R&D so good for entry-level employees.

Cons: Communication from corporate to field executive need better systems in place to insure employees are able to take their vacation time,
Advice: Appreciate your field account executives who work tirelessly to achieve your objectives and sales goals.  Product testers received by the thousands should not be sent to AE!  It takes too much valuable time.
Pros: Car benefits competitive salary, free products, great sales meetings, profit sharing all the necessary tools needed to do function at the job.

Cons: Management works on this transformation project but it’s not translating to lower levels; disfunctional in many aspects where R&amp;R are defined but not inforced; hire from outside and encourage changes but the speech ‘in L’Oreal is like this’ is everywhere
Advice: Embrace the change you talk about or just assume who you trully are; Be honest about the true values of the company
Pros: Nice benefits package, nice offices, multi-brand and big footprint/locations

Cons: Everything else - a catty work environment, dysfunctional management, advancement based on brown-nosing and not merit, was like working in a sweatshop.  It was a very hierarchical and elitist environment.  All the good people - people that had dignity and worked hard - left including myself.  I would never recommend this company to anyone.  I worked there for five years.
Advice: Get over yourself and start appreciating good people that work hard not just those that will kiss your behinds!
Pros: Getting discounted product was the only pro here.

Cons: No work-life balance. Jumping through many hoops to get your ideas pushed through. A lack of integrity and proper management from AVP levels (on Garnier)
Advice: There are some horrible leaders who have been in the same positions for years that bully and take advantage of growing talent with verbal abuse and discriminatory comments. HR is only there to protect the company and not the employees.
Pros: 50 % off Loreal Products. Beautiful office space

Cons: No new ideas. Only white men from Europe approving white models and old fashioned ads. Condescending coworkers, understaffed and overworked. Very boring, procedural tasks with no creativity behind it. Forced us into the office during a pandemic and bribed us with snacks to "make it better". Actively told someone not to tell anyone they had to wfh because they had covid.
Advice: Why are you hiring people with good ideas only to sell, sell, sell and never actually innovate? Stop being a follower and create something new. Treat your employees right and stop hiding covid cases
Pros: Free and discounted beauty supplies. Big name company

Cons: They over work you, back to back 14+ hour days, make you work through the entire weekends, including holidays, zero work life balance, when upper management preaches about it constantly and then dumps more on your lap
Advice: Compensate your employees better, upper management should understand the work that their direct reports are responsible for, have an an actually succession plan in place(for chain of command)
Pros: Discounts at the company store company store

Cons: Terrible hours
Ridiculous turnover -  so many people come and go, resulting in constant training of new marketers who would ultimately leave for a competitor.
Advice: Stop copying competitors and calling it your own innovation.  Stop presenting to yourselves and start creating demand for your products.
Pros: Project management and time management skills.

Cons: Work life balance is an ongoing issue. Sometimes directions are so top-down, you wonder if management really listens to its constituents. The programs are there to support your personal life, but then you wonder if the culture reflects the same disposition.
Advice: Have more agile ways of listening to your employees.
Pros: You can take control of your career, especially if you network with the right people.

Cons: Constant change in upper corporate management. Lots of interns working positions.that should be done by a trained individual. Changes made at store level as well, but for the good. It's retail you do work nights and weekends .. so this may be a con for some people. No real room to grow unless you take a position with retail brand
Advice: Upper management keep hearing you store managers voice.
Pros: Great benefits, Lots of perks, Able to have some sort of work life balance, competent upper management, Love working with makeup and skin care everyday . You drive your own business very little micro managing.

Cons: Everyone under a VP is basically the same level.  Everyone cranks out mindless decks ALL DAY LONG.  It's bizzare.  Truly.  I mean think decks with over 1,000 slides where only 10-15 slides are actually shown.  Worst company I have ever worked for hands down.  It's mostly former bankers who enjoy the punishment of mindless decks since they get to go home at 10pm as opposed to 3 am.  Just don't.  Skip this one.
Advice: Get a grip.
Pros: None I can thing of or maybe it's the measly free product you get each month.

Cons: Work life balance is crazy little downtime for yourself
Too many products that can be confusing to sell to end user

Pros: Scientifically based skincare products
Perks such as a 401k, 3 weeks vacation time, vested after 5 years
Highly skilled and intelligent sales team

Cons: Clinical management is not handled appropriately. Not everyone is management material, anda degree does not equal a good or great manager, great problem solver, etc. Managers are either a wall or a resource to their team. Unofficial (official) managers, or allowing peers to manage is an unacceptable behavior.
Advice: Companies large or small can no longer to afford to lose sight of what is important to employees and how to retain the best. The playing field must be level and companies that continue to wear blinders, for some staff, that act outside of the policies and behaviorial standards (if you have them) will suffer from turnover.
Pros: Love of the product(s)

Cons: Terrible middle management, place is a circus.  No upward movement, culture is operations versus marketing.  Best advice is to get out after a few years.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, nice people, I made lots of friends.  Operations culture stresses good work life balance.  WAAAAAY to many meetings, to review and discuss same topics.   Advancement is not by intelligence, rather your ability to get others to like you.

- Company strongly favors the brand management team, which sometimes makes other teams feel like they aren't as important
- Lots of turnover and burnout
Advice: Find a way to keep your employees! You burn out alot of great talent!
Pros: - Ability to have alot of ownership over your products and projects
- Free Goods ($80 worth) every month to spend in the company store

Advice: None
Pros: There are so many places to feel involved at L’Oreal, whether in their think tanks or community events you will certainly feel like part of something bigger than yourself. Great benefits packages. The company is all about developing and growing talent, and strongly encourages all employees to create goals to stretch and challenge themselves

Cons: ZERO WORK LIFE BALANCE
With current restructures, there's not enough people to do the job
While there may seem to be many opportunities for growth, it's not as easy to move. It's all about who you know
Advice: None
Pros: good healthcare benefits
good salary (better if you come from external company) you have to fight for it if you've been in the company too long.
good friendships get developed since you spend allot of time with them

Cons: Workload
You can get a terrible terrible manager
Lots of BS work done here because upper management sent an email about it
Worklife balance is out of order here. 
If you're not climbing the corporate ladder and super ambitious, you won't fit in here and may struggle.
Advice: Look into the turnover rate and closely review the direct managers of employees that are leaving. Usually there's a correlation there ;-)
Pros: Experience
Pay is Good
Looks good on a resume

Cons: Things change all of the time! Also, depending on the brand it can be very difficult to get decisions made so you are usually working on many scenarios simultaneously waiting for management to make a decision.
Advice: None
Pros: Marketing is the core of L'Oreal.  It is fast pace, high energy, always changing and moving, you will not get bored, but you need to be flexible, adaptable and very quick.

Cons: Excessively long hours at this site, due to the nature of the business overall, often happens.  Preparing for corporate frequent visits takes away too much production time.
Advice: Continue to work with employees to make the workplace a place they want to succeed and prosper.
Pros: Clean environment with comfortable working conditions as much as possible. Good pay with great benefits for the present and future. Lots of worker teamwork. Safety of workers is a high priority.

Cons: No recognition for hard work.  Favoritism over merit.  No work life balance.  Profit driven - regardless if it creates inefficiencies in process.
Advice: Take care of your team - they make you look good.  Develop your team so they can grow and contribute.
Pros: Experience at L'Oreal looks good on a resume.  You can succeed any other employer after working at L'Oreal.  Good Benefits.

Cons: Doesn't pay well, doesn't give you enough discount on products so as employee could afford and to try and at least let customers know how they feel. Thier always changing district managers and they need repair the store .
Advice: Listen to the employees we are the ones working in the store take our opinions . Give us more knowledge in products like online class and more pay please
Pros: Love my team that I work with and products

Cons: health benefits not as good as they were, very political especially when it comes to moving up and growing in the company, lots of empty promises in development, communication can improve
Advice: none
Pros: the company cares about its employees, makes a huge effort in terms of the environment and sustainability, safety is way better than you'll find elsewhere

Cons: I've been working here for about a year and already, I've had my manager accuse me of falsifying hours worked (I had to have other employees verify that I was present), my manager place the blame for a project's failure on me when I received no training regarding this project even though I repeatedly asked my manager for training, and quite simply a lack of communication between myself and management.

I have tried to speak to my manager, but my manager is hardly in the office. Yet the second that I take my allotted 15 minute break (once per every 4 hours), my manager accuses me of slacking off on the job. I have done my best to communicate my needs via email, which strangely take days to be answered, but when I receive an email from my manager, it is an issue if I don't reply within a few hours.

One day, I went to meet another colleague for the first time and I was abruptly told that my manager had spoken ill of me to other people whom I had not even met.
Advice: After having spoken to other employees about my situation, I realize my situation is probably more extreme than most others. However, others are still experiencing elements of my situation that lead me to believe that the problem is universal. There is a discord between how management views its employees (as simply workers) and how employees view their managers (as part time bosses and part time friends). Ultimately, the culture needs to change to reflect that employees are more than friends and that the company looks out for its employees. Change starts from the top. I now realize that working at a company with such poor culture makes it incredibly hard to gain anyone's attention to climb the corporate ladder. This is why there is so much turnover here and why the culture is poisonous.
Pros: The company has a great cafeteria with cheap prices and discounts on its products for employees.

Cons: Stress levels are HIGH! 
No work/life balance.
Working  weekend days equates to 1 complimentary day;  2 days worked on a wknd (aka personal time) should = 2 days off
Paycheck is monthly.
Advice: Raises are apreciated and help motivate.
Make sure all team members pull their weight.
Mandate interns for every division/brand & dept.
Stop reductions in force
Pros: Discount in Company Store.
The idea of summer fridays (workload often doesnt permit you to participate)

Cons: No mobility 
No talent development
Raises were low
Diversion is killing the professional products division 
No training on internal changes- for instance they rolled out SAP and didn't want the sales operation team to tell the sales reps.
Advice: Develop the bench it could only help you.
Pros: Good benefits and perks
Good sense of work life balance in most cases
Good products - which are apart of company benefits
Remote position
Vehicle 
Laptop
Generous T&E

Pros: Decent pay
Company discount
A lot of manufacturing exposure

Cons: Unappreciative of dedication and work
Hard to move up without knowing the right person or sucking up
Underpaid compared to other companies in the same industry

Pros: Benefits
Experience
Training
Fast paced and technical advanced
Great competitor

Cons: "You're never bored" is at the price of an increasing level of complexity 
So many Changes can be overwhelming and affect work/Life balance
Advice: Focus on people, people, people
They are the best asset of L'Oreal
Pros: Very dynamic environment 
Great benefit package
Deep and real corporate Sustainability strategy 
High level of empowerment, you can definitively put new ideas on the table and activate L'Oreal network to make it happen

Cons: Process. The processes are antiquated and inconsistent. You're often challenged to "think outside of the box" however when making decisions and suggestions, you're told that you just don't understand the process, or that you're not a culture fit.

Humiliation. I was once sitting in a meeting where a higher-up displayed work of mine on a slideshow and began to laugh telling everyone "this is what not to do" and everyone began laughing.  She then began to insult my intelligence and explain why she felt that  my work was wrong; all while laughing at my expense.

People. I  found out that a close family member died while I was at work, I'll never forget collapsing in the hallway and seeing my manager and a colleague look me in the eyes and turn their heads and continue walking. Additionally, my manager asked if my family member died of a drug overdose or a gun shot (assumed due to my ethnicity). I brought this comment to HR and nothing was said or done about it; the comments continued.

Management. In addition to  rude comments, I would be yelled at almost everyday for no apparent reason. I was told that people were talking about me and making fun of me and that I should be appreciative of her for sticking up for me but also that I seemed stupid. Not all managers at L'Oreal are like this, however many are. Meanwhile, my work was done and done very well.

If you are NOT concerned with your mental health then this is a great place to work. the people here are awful, the work is unnecessarily stressful.
Advice: Throw the entire management away.
Pros: I was very proud to work here when I first started... but that pride dissipated at one month in.

Cons: Lack of company investment, L’Oréal always looks for the cheapest least quality way of investment into there supply chain, lack of systems, lack of IT support, lack of knowledgeable leadership, bias promotions and favoritism.

Pros: good start pay, free product, flexible hours, summer hours, vacation buy, 401k, profit sharing, none. None. None. None. None. None.

Cons: Long hours including mandatory overtime standing almost the entire shift.  Lots of management changes bringing their own sets of rules and ideas to adapt to.
Advice: When a there is a change in policy or idea, stick to it permanently and not just for a few weeks.
Pros: Good pay and benefits usually with ample amounts of overtime.  All PPE and uniforms including safety shoes and prescription safety glasses provided.

Cons: Hierarchical culture means slow moving and indecisiveness; L'Oreal kids (who have only worked their) have a very warped sense of the outside world sometimes
Advice: None
Pros: The entrepreneurial spirit; constant collaboration; allows for creativity and innovation; you can make your role as big as you want it to be which can be very empowering and motivating

Cons: Company moves very slow and struggles with making a decision. Often projects are reworked over and over again, causing intense pressure on the organization to meet deadlines. Also, but most importantly, the company is very siloed with functions. Everyone thinks they control something and very hard to understand who's the clear leader.
Advice: None
Pros: Great brands with exceptional equity. This company has mastered the art of telling a compelling story within the beauty industry

Cons: Operating at that level of intensity on a daily basis leads to a fast burnout. Late nights are not more common than not and there isn't much thanks for your hard work.
Advice: None
Pros: You are working with the big boys. You are learning how to think big and think fast.
If you can succeed here you will succeed everywhere.

Cons: - Office politics can get in the way of actual work
- Large focus placed on rank within the organization. Management can often be cold to someone that just wants to talk.
Advice: Being more open and upfront about expectations. Recognize people by work quality rather than rank.
Pros: - Demanding, hands-on environment with an emphasis on results. 
- An always busy environment with a lot going on at once

Cons: L'Oreal requires you to "drink to Koolaid." This is not a company for a person with independent though. If you are a drone this will be a perfect fit for you.
Advice: Keep you skilled sales talent. The constant turn over hurts your customer base and the perception that L'Oreal is a good company to partner with.
Pros: Large organization with potential to move up through different divisions.

Cons: Bad pay, no benefits, not included in all company-wide events, like full-time salaried employees, no paid vacation, personal time, or sick leave; no established system in place for contract employees to seek permanent employment.
Advice: Include contract L'Oreal staff members in ALL events; pay some vacation, sick & personal time; create systems and opportunities for contract employees to become permanent.
Pros: Great team atmosphere (but I've heard it's not indicative of all departments in the company)

Cons: 60 hour work weeks - you spend your days in meetings and are expected to work late nights, weekends, holidays, and vacations to get everything done.
Advice: I was told this year that one of my projects was one of the most strategically important initiatives of the company but yet I only received a 2% increase?
Pros: Faced paced, energetic, learning environment

Cons: top talent on a team is straight up worked into the ground . dont let them know how ambitious you are if you are top talent because they'll hang it over your head in every review / feedback session to get more out of you
Advice: None
Pros: really bright teammates that really care about what they do. inspiring, motivating.

Cons: easy job, easy to turn into an idiot.  low paying relative to competitors.
Advice: enforce training, improve communications at higher level to reduce interference with international partners.  and stop lying about innovation, you don't give your employees enough time to do it.
Pros: benefits, easy job to do if you don't care.

Cons: Hires and promotes unqualified people and definitely discriminates silently against age clearly visible in hiring and re org outcomes..
Advice: Stop over promoting leaders that use expense accounts to build relationships with clients but then struggle with engagement because they do not have the skill set to deliver sales and growth.
Pros: Status and resume building with so many companies there are many opportunities that all come with great gratis and free product options.

Cons: very little work/life balance
if you are not a favorite- don't bother showing up for work!
very little middle management- so company is run by entry level and senior management- don't expect anyone to help you make decisions.
very competitive
Advice: take the MAP/TAP process seriously
listen to employees and customers
provide targeted on the job training
know target operating model (TOM) and communicate it to the staff - so everyone is on the same page
invest in better technology -  to streamline processes and keep up with the competition
Pros: great product- who doesn't love make-up
great discount at company stores & outlets
fun co-workers when on the right team

Cons: You might think a multi-billionaire dollar company has all the perks, but looks can be deceiving. Horrible work and family life balance. Sometimes i didn't get home to my kids till late in the evening. There's a demand for work to be done but no recognition and you are expected to work late without overtime (managers get bonuses...not the rest of us and managers barely do anything) There's a huge turnover rate because there are much better opportunities out there and the employees know this too - they just get too comfortable and deal with it and are too lazy to look elsewhere, especially the women who are obsessed with free makeup goods. People try to kiss you know what to work their way up the ladder, its disgusting. There are some people who are workaholics and others who don't do work at all and just chitchat away in their offices for half a day while others work their brains off. There's definite favoritism in the office amongst managers, temps get treated lower than interns and are barely recognized for their work. I can't tell you how many of my coworkers (temps) got treated badly, they don't receive any benefits remotely and are forced to do a lot of the work even though they are paid significantly less and do the same work as regular employees. Treat your people equally and fairly if they are doing the work you requested of them. Those in managerial and senior positions are lazy and try to shove work in our direction. If only corporate knew about half the stuff that went on here, there would be definite investigations
Advice: Try to observe what goes on in the office and demote/fire people who don't add any value - there are people who are there for the sake of play and not work, and you are wasting money on them. You also wouldn't have a huge turnover rate if you listened to the needs of your employees. when i was in the office last year, i was astounded at how many people were unhappy and were actively looking elsewhere for a job. When people left, and replacements were hired, within a few weeks the replacements were looking elsewhere. You promise gold but when people realize you got nothing to offer but bronze, well, you're the ones looking bad.
Pros: -Awesome products at a discount at the company store
-diverse staff
-knowledgeable people
-Good benefits

Cons: Work-life balance is always challenged, they'll take as much as you give. Pay isn't competitive. Meeting-centric work style. High turnover.
Advice: None
Pros: The people are some of the best you can work with. Something new every day, never a dull moment. Young environment, lots of new hires

Cons: Constant cost cutting and view of people as resources, replaceable cogs.  This comes down from upper Management which is incredibly hierarchal and represents all the worst elements of french culture..
Advice: You demand a lot.  You pay for little.  You get people to go above and beyond for years.  Then you get a new crop of people when the old ones are burned out.  This is not a healthy strategy
Pros: You can take on a lot roles and responsibilities outside your official job.  Offices are modern and beautiful.  Pay for some employee levels are exceptional.

Cons: Stressful work environment.  There is always a high workload.  Does not matter your level, you will be in the weeds. I find this exciting, but it may not be for everyone
Advice: Keep up the momentum!
Pros: Flexible work environment. Focus on results not where/when work is being done. Leader in the industry. Aggressive acquisition strategy. If you can’t beat them, buy them!

Cons: - No work life balance whatsoever. Expected to stay late every day and to work on weekends.
- Lied to on role and work responsibility.
- Heavily understaffed. Employees take on the burden to not only take on 1-2 roles, but anywhere between 6-8. Impossible.
- No flexibility whatsoever.
- Archaic methods of working. There is no adaptation to current times and you are forced to not work digitally. Laptops are not allowed to be used unless you are at your desk.
- Extremely and unnecessarily tactful. Rules on top of rules on top of rules.
- Polarizing cultural differences within organization. There is no real connection to the company whatsoever because of what unqualified managers implement and forced in their teams.
- Complete lack of structure. Only endless amount of processes creating overabundance of responsibilities or no clear delineation on work load.
- No guidance from manager whatsoever. No direction or set goals. You are to be like a robot who is to pump work out on a daily basis. Managers who avoid investment into employees and 1 on 1s. No development programs established by manager.
- No clarity ever causing a sense of panic and confusion every day.
- No onboarding or training at all. You are thrown into the fire and expected to learn everything on your own. 
- No team building events or activities. Ultimately, unrewarding, un-motivating, and completely draining.
- Manager who lacks any solutions to growing endless problems.
- Managers who do not respect others time.
- Negative employees causing a toxic work environment for others. Specifically those who have been with the organization for a number of years. It's their way or the highway.
- Cannot be yourself. Excruciating. 
- Tendency of others to inflict and unload personal emotional burdens onto others.
- Extremely rigid and restrictive.
- Foul mouthed employees who then explain they are only passionate about the work.
- Extreme need to manage manager.
- Absolutely no resource or capacity management.
- Deep mental, emotional, physicaly fatigue.
- Enormous amount of stress, not only due to work but because of others.
- Completely un-empowering. Your voice is white noise and will not be heard. "This is the way it is so adjust to it". Forced assimilation.
- Hypocrisy
Advice: Adapt and change. The organization needs to be flexible and not suffocating those who come in as new employees. Do not lie to potential employees on the job itself and what is to be done once joined. They will eventually leave, why go through the nonsense. Treat employees like human beings. You have families yourselves, would you like a stranger treating your child or family member the way you do to others? Everyone has a different working style and every person is different. Let people feel comfortable and be themselves. The toxic environment needs to stop immediately. The older generation and the tribalistic employees who have stayed for over 10-20 years have created a cult like atmosphere. All talk and can't walk the walk. Please listen to your employees and stop creating unnecessary hardships and forcing people to be someone they are not. This is embarassing how a global organization still works like a mom and pop shop in 2018. There is a desperate need for a PMO and structure within the departments. People look miserable coming in day in and day out. Need diversity and inclusion. Over 70% of the organization are women. This is not being addressed enough.
Pros: - Pay
- Benefits - Pension
- Some good employees if you can find them

Cons: I am so happy to be working for such a reputable company with a strong culture, so none.
Advice: None
Pros: I have been working at L'Oréal for a little over a month now. As a recent college grad, I couldn't be happier with my role and the environment I get to work in. Management and directors want you to learn, encourage creativity, and acknowledge a job well done.

Cons: The plant itself runs very slow and the operating system can be a drag.  As a intern, the work place can be a bit boring.
Advice: Leadership at L'Oreal USA was tremendous. All the managers and other engineers were very helpful and beneficial to others. Thanks to you all.
Pros: Relationship with workers and engineers is very satisfying. Learned a lot from mangers and other workers who mostly do the hands-on activities.

Cons: Forget work/life balance in any form.   Also, extremely political and bureaucratic
Advice: Invest in your people - give them the level of human resources to get the job done and be able to think strategically as well.   You've cut HR way too much over the last 3 years
Pros: You'll meet extremely smart people and build an extensive network

Cons: - Internship is a much much different experience than working there full-time
- Work/life balance (expect to stay until at least 9/10 pm and work on weekends)
- Office politics/culture (L'Oreal has its reputation for a reason..insanely cutthroat and catty)
- Inefficient workflow process 
- Terrible upper management and talent development
- Notoriously horrible turnover

Samples to try new products 
everyone is very passionate about the products

Cons: - Sexist environment, where women are objectified for a living
- Culture of duplicity and lying
- Everyone is afraid, and the "walls have ears"
Advice: - Do the housework - get rid of some of the top managers, who are repeat offenders; you know who they are. Stop facilitating them. Have some courage. Walk the talk!
Pros: - Pay is good
- Headquarters is beautiful, even if in a terrible neighborhood

Cons: Typical bureaucracy found in all large companies; facility furnishings need to be updated
Advice: Keep doing what you're doing...as it seems to be working well.
Pros: Great community, knowledgeable team members, dedicated employees, and management who care not only about your work, but also your career development.  I'd recommend anyone wanting to work in cosmetics to try to work for the Hair Color team in Clark.
Great benefits.

Cons: I had an interview with L’Oréal Paris at 24-7 Intouch Call Center in August 2018 and I was interviewed by four managers. To be quite honest, I was a bit intimidated especially when I wasn’t given any time to look into the company because I was asked to come in for the interview the same day from the center. They asked me questions about brands I’ve never even heard of. So I didn’t do so well in the interview so they decided not to go forward. I was called back for another interview at 24-7 Intouch while I had already moved back to New York in January and came back to give it one more try and was asked to come in for an interview for Urban Decay. I explained to them my experience and they said they decided to give it another try. I was called again for an assessment and passed, and was scheduled a second interview with URban Decay for February 28th. I arrived 15 minutes before my interview and they called me right when I was outside the building. When I came inside they told me that had to have a discussion with me and I was told I can no longer proceed with the next steps due to the failed interview I had in August, which was 6 months ago. I invested so much time traveling from New York and back and forth to the center to just get denied from an interview of 6 months ago!! I believe this is really unfair to me and my time and didn’t even have the decency to apologize or even thank me for my time! I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work at a place where they don’t value you as a person or your time in general. Who wouldn’t get nervous when they’re being interview by 4 managers?!! It seems to me once you fail an interview one time you can never apply again.
Advice: I believe the company  should consider each individual, and look closely to who’s doing the hiring and how the interviews are being held. Just because an interview went bad 6 months ago does not mean the person isn’t a qualified candidate.
Pros: Didn’t work there to know anything good about the company.

Cons: micro management, non-competitive salary and salary increases
Advice: Brands can only take you so far.  Internal politics and micromanaging is debilitating for the organization.   Proof:  Willingness to Recommend Scores Historically Low
Pros: benefits, brand reputation, products and community service

Cons: Potential to be great. Bad choices for management of the Shared Services location creating a terrible environment. Sadly, a lot of the good people have moved on and the toxic members are still around.
Advice: They won't take advice.  The ones I worked with thought everyone else was stupid except for themselves.
Pros: Overshadowed by toxic environment created by management.

Cons: Owned by L'Oréal.   Very low pay.  Bad management that doesn't  follows the rules they invented.  HR doesn't do anything a kiosk couldn't do. Upper management bonus for having a bad attitude and lack of a personality . Sexual harassment is ok at L'Oréal, even if you complain about it.
Advice: Quit
Pros: Most parts come from China but assembled in Washington. The people are friendly until you meet the upper working class that came in from L'OREAL.  If you like the .25 cents a year wage increase L'Oreal is the place for you.

Cons: i don't have any cons for the company t this point maybe that it is so structured it can maybe be sometimes difficult to shift things within but haven't yet experienced it
Advice: None
Pros: amazing mentors facilities and mentoring programs and managers investing in your career and want you to grow; super professional; nurturing environment; global oriented - i love the company

Advice: None
Pros: Benefits, best I've seen. Time off. Competitive pay
Your hard will show when they look at how many scans you did within your shift.

Cons: Packaging management does not have engineering experience this makes decisions a long drawn out process. They were promoted for political reasons
Advice: Far too many French expats. There should be a time limit two years maximum. The french management looks down on American employees
Pros: Loreal has great systems a young engineer will learn much. Loreal cannot retain good engineers, they leave for better opportunities

Cons: It can be chaotic, and not a process driven as other companies
Advice: None
Pros: I like that I am given autonomy and trusted to handle my business. The company will let you explore an idea, so you get the opportunity to prove yourself. Most of the people I work with are high performers, so keeping up with them has helped me improve myself.

Cons: too much stress, too demanding, no appreciation for staff, no organization, very poorly run, have a huge turn over rate, run by men, very few females in upper management in all of LOreal, not just Canada, gets environmental awards & yet fills landfills with discarded, unused signage by the ton, should spend more on operational side rather than marketing, cut back on the millions for celebrity endorsements, profitable & yet cuts staff, so concerned with beating P&G that they have lost sight of their own business, in a sad state & declining rapidly
Advice: None
Pros: new products, ever changing, sponsors events

Cons: If you don't like to social and want to use logics, facts, science, that's not the place you will enjoy.
Advice: Make a better effort to understand how works are actually get done.  You will be surprised how your resources are wasted.
Pros: A great place for young and self promoted people.

Cons: Nepotism
Politics
Brands don't live up to their reputation because leadership does not know how to run a business or manage people

Good company store
Try to find MBA talent but very hit or miss on how they are treated

Cons: too much manual work because of lack of systems.  Supply Chain is more of an analysis to MKTG and always given busy work to help their cause instead of working on biggier picture.
Advice: work life balance and promotions are small comapred to other companies.
Pros: great exposure to upper managment. You can work next to the VP and GM's everyday helping shape exectutive decisions.

Cons: Work/life balance, your career mobility depends on a lot on your manager's opinion, French management politics.
Advice: Work toward becoming less top-heavy.  People spend too much time preparing for internal meetings and less time focusing on making the world more beautiful.
Pros: Entrepreneurial, innovative, fast-paced, challenging environment, but not competitive...people only compete with themselves.

Cons: Maybe getting more feedback would be helpful at some points during work, but normally when you ask for it you get it.
Advice: None
Pros: Colleagues are friendly, the work style is very professional, and there is a true culture of excellence. I also appreciate the talent diversity.
There's a strong culture of entrepreneurship. Individuals can really shape their own job to a certain degree.

Cons: You don't get to sit in many of larger meetings
There is definitely a culture clash at L'Oréal - between French and American culture. 
There is also a big fear culture and as a result not that much flexible hierarchy and a lack of communication.
Advice: None
Pros: Dynamic work environment
A lot of hands on work and you really get to understand both marketing and product development
It is challenging and very interesting

Cons: The timelines are usually tight, especially considering the time to get the testing done.  More and more regulations and it is hard to introduce any technologies in a timely fashion.
Advice: None
Pros: The people in L'Oreal are generally nice and would like to help.  Benefits are good with retirement plan.  There are many opportunities in the company.  HR is amazingly efficient.

Advice: Keep doing what you are doing
Pros: Good people, interesting company.  This company has a very bright future and a great product.  There is tremendous career potential due to being part of L'Oreal.

Cons: The company expects endless work and never is satisfied. You can work yourself until you burn out.
Advice: Too many meetings- need to institute a no-meeting day!
Pros: The people around you are all equally dedicated to the success of the brand- it's motivating to work amongst people who are as driven as you.

Cons: Very poor training, its certainly sink or swim. The french culture wants you to define your own boundaries, thus, don't expect a job description, by design they don't exist.
Advice: None
Pros: European benefits (good vacation, medical, pension, car, etc)
Autonomy in role
Free products galore
A non PC environment
I will mention that my experience is based on being in a small sales office, the HQ climate may vary?

Advice: None
Pros: #1 beauty company 
Fast paced, there are opportunities to move and grow
Great benefits package
Great employee perks
Mobility exposure

Cons: Unethical - upper mgt gets away with a lot. Cliquey environment. Work life balance is non existent. They indoctrinate you early on (post collage). If you join mid-career level then you definitely feel like an outsider.  You either drink the cool air or you don’t.

Cons: As the headline states, this only applies to the Little Rock site. Where do I even begin?

In addition to frequent management restructuring, site has a high employee turnover rate for reasons mentioned below. 

Management believes that by virtue of being in positions of power that they are correct about anything 100% of the time. It's precisely this kind of hubris that drives away employees who attempt to engage in a culture of continuous improvement. Ironically, the same arrogance from management contributes to a lack of self awareness, which further perpetuates the high turnover rate of the site and leaves management flummoxed about the turnover rate . While the parent company adopts a culture of continuous improvement, the Little Rock site is all about the status quo. "Make it work" and "no need for fixing if it ain't broken" are accurate phrases that capture this sentiment. In short, the arrogance and deflection is congruent with the people in this part of the country. There is a reason why this part of the country always lags behind the west and northeast.

Completely disorganized departments run by managers/directors who are either incompetent or simply don't have the knowledge and background to effectively run their respective departments. Consequently, managers heavily rely on subordinates to take care of managerial tasks in addition to daily responsibilities. 

The Little Rock site has a brilliant training program for aspiring managers, which involves placing them in a department that has no compatibility with their skill set. This is analogous to having a lawyer play doctor and vice versa, further contributing to the disorganization and incompetency. 

Some coworkers can be toxic.

Good learning and development team/ really good trainings

Cons: From what I heard, other divisions are okay but luxury department is really the worst, please rethink if you want to join. The work is all over the place and more often not aligned with your scope, they promise it will get better but only becomes worse because there’s people quitting almost every other month. Managers do not know how to lead and not communicate any changes in direction, until the very last minute which makes it very hard to carry out tasks, and only blame you because you’re not “agile enough”. The higher ups only have their own selfish agendas to push, take credit and provides no visibility. 

They say to encourage you to report anything unethical but after you do, you’re not shielded and higher ups/HR will make your life even more difficult or even target you on professional setting. Be warned to always protect yourself even to your own manager or HR, in any form of communication because it will be used against you.
Advice: Stop favouring people just because they have been in the company for so long. If so many employees are quitting under the same manager, look into it seriously because there’s so much lost talent because of this.

Cons: All the horror stories you have heard about working for Loreal are true. Very poor onboarding and training with little to no support. Workloads are insanely high with poor work life balance leading to burnout with lots of people suffering with negative mental health issues but are scared to speak out due to fear of dictatorial leaders. Very hierarchical with chaotic and unorganised structures and processes. There is a facade of wellbeing with no actions put in place to protect staff. The company culture is dense, unwelcoming and highly confusing for anyone entering externally. I would not recommend working for Loreal you are a gluton for punishment, humiliation and stress.

Cons: Where do I begin? Unless you're a straight white Eton boy, don't bother. You will only get places at loreal if you have done the grad scheme and to get onto to grad scheme you need to have completed an essentially unpaid internship - which in London is only possible if your family have money and therefore rules out a whole bunch of demographics.
On top of this, you will not go far if you don't kiss bums of those higher up and shovel flour up your nose with them at the Christmas party.
Basically if you're working class or a person of colour, don't do it to yourself, it is NOT 'worth it'

Advice: Make sure to make an effort with interns and form a bond, helping them keep track of all their progress especially from the start of placement  as working in a big company can be overwhelming and guidance would beneficial especially within the first few weeks.

Pros: The team depends on the division and function you get to. Nevertheless, all the divisions that I had to work in were friendly, understanding and encouraging. The company has a great employer-oriented policy.

At the moment

Pros: Nice environment and culture to work

Cons: Toxic culture coming from above. Senior managers in constant fear passing this down to their direct reports. Beware the under pressure General Manager who needs to divert attention from their numbers being down and diverting attention on junior members of staff in online for not doing more to bridge their finance gaps. L'Oreal's growth is driven by acquiring brands which they don't integrate, so as an Account Manager you're dealing with numerous ops, finance and marketing teams. 
Product launch dates mostly missed, so best laid plans to agree client marketing with no stock = nightmare.
This is a truly nasty place to work, unless of course you're a highly ambitious, cut-throat sociopath, then you'll probably be ok.
Advice: Review staff daily workflow to witness increased workload created by inefficiencies. Also, someone should look into how much money this company loses due to poor management of promotional pricing and ambitious/greedy staff lining their own pockets/getting promoted on the back of high sales with tiny gross profit.

My manager don't even help me move across function even other senior manager offer me a position  but verbally and using interpersonal languages to pushing me out by throwing me in the bus in front of my employee for times before I could explain the situation. Very little coaching on the job.

Political everywhere 4. Unethic workplace &amp; employees treatment: A. Some of former employees who were contractors - didn't get their contract renew however company still ask them to go to work, and promise will renew the contract. Then when the employees got sick and must take leave for illness treatment in hospital, company took that reason not to renew the contract with them because "you're already on leave anyway, we will hire you back when you're healthy if your position is still "in need". Hence, the former employee got no health insurance to cover their hospital fees. B. Former employees report ethics od their line manager on company's system - which is anonymous. And HR took that review and told the line manager this is what your team wrote about you. 5. Bad &amp; old office building. There is no space for newcomers, and no one took care of them (laptop, email, workspace,...). My N-1 had no where to sit and we asked for support but it took 2 weeks just to find a proper place to sit.

Teams from different countries are happy to collaborate and with each other and work together to achieve good outcomes. Customers have good relationships with their account managers and are proud stockists and distributors of the L'Oréal branded products. L'Oréal follows processes that work for the business and their customers. Consumers, aside from myself, are my family, friends and many across the world. People I interact with, all know L'Oréal, its a long standing company name, and they enjoy the products. L'Oréal impresses me personally with their research on consumer needs and invest in creating products to suit all skin types, all hair types, all cosmetic and beauty preferences based on their research. I am extremely proud to work for this company and see myself retiring here, because outside of my comfort home-sweet-home space, L'Oréal my work-sweet-work space

Elitism
Advice: None
Pros: Free products
Learning new technology

Cons: No cons from present experience
Advice: N/A
Pros: Amazing company to work for

Cons: Micromanagement, very operational position, work load too heavy, you are not well formed or not formed at all by anyone but it is expected that you work as if you has years of experience in the company, company culture of gossip, people don't treat other with respect, people leaving because of a burn out is very common and normalized, the majority of people I met had the impostor syndrome developed when they started in the company and not before.... You leave no earlier than 19h30 because of the work load.
Advice: Is a whole thing of savoir-être that will be improved if the work load was less, as stress levels could decrease. Teams need more people to make it less stressful so hire more people. Also the culture of radical autonomy without teaching is a cause of this bad savoir-être and environment, if people where formed in their position they would be less alone, stressed, confident and so many errors would be avoided, people would be more motivated and not feeling this impostor syndrome.
Pros: International experience, prime d'activité, CSE, dynamic, access to the division products.

Cons: The pay is relatively low for our ability and the amount of work.
Advice: None
Pros: Super supportive team and enabling managers. Unique culture that seems to have a positive impact on me.

Cons: - Fixed and rigid programme (rotation positions are based off company needs, often times to support the high turnover)
- Salary is fixed even after graduation, regardless of background and skillsets, everyone will get the same pay and progression
- Career progression is slow, was told by HR that career progression places more emphasis and value on years of experience compared to skillset. (i.e. can only receive a promotion after 3-6 years, otherwise it will be a 'pseudo promotion where one is 'promoted' to a 'senior role' with more workload and same pay grade) 
- Year on year increment is around 1-4% (some years with 0% increment)
- Ironically, for a company that claims to be 'people centric', HR system is poor and have pushed many Management Trainees to resign
- Work-wise: extremely high legacy systems plague the operations
Advice: - Value staff more, not just management trainees but also interns, and full time staff by giving the recognition and reward when due. 
- Progression (while yes a portion of it is tagged to experience), should not be so heavily based off that, once career progression is 'fixed' to a certain number of years and don't consider skillsets, it deters people away. 
- Management Trainee Programmes is not an avenue to make everyone (regardless of skillsets and experience) to level the salary expectations, one should still be compensated based off market rates upon graduation
Pros: - Quarterly free products but only for items where there is exceeding stock, items may take more than a month to arrive
- Team culture generally supportive with some really inspirational and wise mentors that guide

Cons: one has to independently take charge
Advice: None

Cons: No free coffee in a French company
Advice: None
Pros: Cheap canteen food, nice people

Cons: High pressure for success 
Heavy workload and long hours
Advice: None
Pros: Fast paced environment with potential for advancement
Stimulating and challenging work

Cons: Social committees are division based, so the amount of staff perks can vary per department depending on how enthusiastic the committee is. Can be busy, workload can lead you to working overtime. Sometimes department headcount’s are stretched thin and rehiring takes so long that there’s always a gap between a person leaving and a new starter. New starter on-boarding from external can be slow and frustrating (IT equipment not available straight away, not having access to files or email groups, no knowledge of where things are saved…etc)
Advice: Mandatory training for staff becoming people managers for the first time.
Pros: Lots of creative freedom &amp; autonomy (specifically in CPD division) Extremely talented, supportive, passionate and fun team to work with. Fun work events (social committee organising various activities for staff). Lots of free or discounted product sales.

Cons: No cons from me at all
Advice: None
Pros: Nice company, treat staff well

Cons: Faulty internal business processes which create some challenges Poor on-boarding plans and need to add more structure Can and should improve/ be more competitive on salaries and packages If you allow it, you can spend long hours working. You must be organised to enjoy a good work-life balance. Unfortunately, some individuals grow too quickly and are not suitable or competent enough to occupy certain senior roles High employee Turnover : great at securing &amp; recruiting talent ,unfortunately , not as good as retaining it.
Advice: Review HR involvement in key career development plans and give them more flexibility and power to support and ensure they are taking the right steps in securing and retaining talent. Ensure proper working business processes by assigning proper team members to over look the process and measure with the right KPIs. Review packages and salaries to adjust to industry norm by adding a competitive edge. Increase due-diligence on competency to join senior level roles
Pros: Enterprise-wide Exposure: Ability to liaise, present and work alongside key decision makers and top management. Stretch-Assignments &amp; Entrepreneurial Mindset Flexible Work Environment: Ability to work in an office or virtually as needed. Development &amp; Growth Opportunities: Ability to contribute to new processes, ideas, business strategies, and lead/execute as relevant. Health and Wellness Benefits Fast-paced, hands-on experience and talented dynamic collaborators. Incredible networking opportunities and building strong ties

Advice: None
Pros: Giving project ownership to junior staff

Cons: Gossiping behind the backs of friends does not feed each other in a constructive way.
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay, great company benefits

Cons: Male dominated leadership team with old school, bullish approach to achieving their goals. On paper, it would seem to advocate strong ethics but this is more for the soundbite/ticking the box than genuine commitment to social values.
Advice: If there is an opportunity for real change then fully commit instead of reverting to type when challenged. Be more open to criticism and accept the need for change rather than automatically defending your position. Learn the lessons that are gifted to you
Pros: In some sense one of the best/worst companies I've worked for. Very good employee benefits and in terms of ambitions to provide a great place to work it could be a market leader if it wasn't for the cons

Cons: - Toxic environment: Terrible middle-level management (great upper level C-Suites) - No work-life balance (would recommend starting your career here for sure, great learning, but then get out before it kills you) - Not merit-based, promotions are based on how well you know people and how you manage relationships
Advice: Invest in your people, culture and work life balance, it'll help the 50% turnover rate year on year
Pros: - Huge budgets to work with - Thrown in at the deep end (no guides, training or onboarding) - Cutthroat culture (again, great learning, but if you don't perform or are not good in politics, this is not your place) - Lots of perks and great for your CV

Cons: On the human resources/people management side, I found that L'Oreal doesn't care much for their people. When I encountered a personal issue, they promised their support, since they understood that my circumstances were out of my control. They could have helped, and they certainly had the resources to do so, but they ended up doing nothing, even when my abrupt leave of absence left my team stranded with projects. Honestly, great place to work, nice people, and the job was quite fulfilling. But I didn't feel valued as an employee, so even when I finally managed to sort things out and was able to resume work, I chose to leave.
Advice: Do better about caring for your employees' wellbeing. Especially since it's a commitment you claim to have made.

Pros: This year many of my colleagues have been outcasted from going to annual conferences. annual conference is like a loreal trademark way of celebrating success and aspiration. employees always look forward to it. It was not like this before. celebration was inclusive and everyone was included whether you were a junior resource or a cxo. now its only for select people which makes others feel unworthy. it is like saying to those outcasted that u don't matter to us and are not part of the elite group. many people have already excluded themselves from this demonstration of exclusivism and discrimination. if their friends are not part of any such outbound then they also don't want to be.

Salary is v.low in comparison to the work load, a very 'not my job' mentality

Cutting head count and piling people with extra work is not a sustainable way to make profit
Spend money on decent systems or improving/automating processes
Understand the importance of people/roles who execute work, its great looking at strategy but you need people to actually put these into action
Listen to your employees and be pro-active: if you notice unhappiness or stress act on it, or if you see the value of someone pro-actively try to keep them happy in the business. Don't wait until the person is almost out the door.

It’s scary to a point that one could feel L’Oreal itself doesn’t believe in its upskilling program…  directors don’t work on training their  managers but rather higher from outside with prior experiences so new hire tells them what to do… Very Low interest to put in to retaining talent vs recruiting new talent..
Advice: You need a very strong Human Resources team! Most are still working to make people around them kept happy often losing the bigger picture they just leave an upper hand to the business managers and take a back seat.. HR needs to take pride in their function, use data ( this part is non existent) and talks with facts, digital transformation = is also people transformation so please drive this …you all have really really great technical skills but the soft skills are weak.. eg every meeting is started with KPI’s and target achievement why not introduce KPI’s to people management .. and pulse is often used as a tool to bully your boss than giving actual feedback..
Pros: Continuous thrive to do better tomorrow than you did yesterday. Technically capable leaders you have a lot to learn from. You will no be allowed to be complacent everyone has to do something new to show their uniqueness … which is great for one to discover their own potentials .. at director level a lot of job rotations which is good for the team ti bring new energy and new bosses..

Cons: Overpromising the programme of being filled with exciting challenges and exposure for a fast track career. However business needs are put first - landing role and project involvement is subjected to availability.  Learning tends to revolve around company specific processes. 

Office politics and use of power play. Routine tasks with high workload due to lean structure.  Lack of responsibility to take ownership from senior managers when issues arise , instead blame and pinpoint individuals.

In HR 'eyes' this is considered as a training and your real job experience starts from the day you receive a full-time position after the 1 year programme - so if you know what you truly want, get that role instead, otherwise you might 'waste' time rotating and not getting a role in a place which best fits your interests and strengths. For some functions, after the programme, you start off as an executive.
Advice: Walk the talk about grooming young talents, HR spends effort on initiatives however the managers have to change the mindset of MTs and interns being a means to an end.
Pros: Good brand on your resume, okay salary for a fresh grad. HR inductions and integrations help to ease one into the company in the first month but the follow up end to end during the year is poor. Few capable individuals to learn from.

For any work left incomplete weather bcoz of managers work they cut DA. Even a manager can't describe that how tasks are justified for a sales person in a single day. In a single line they want a fish who can swim ,fly, run, without asking food, time . Emotionless organisation.

2. There are a lot of L'Oreal babies (people who have worked in the company for 15-30 years, usually from their first job), who are favoured for promotion
3. However these L'Oreal babies do not know what's out there and may potentially always think they are 'right'
4. Listening skills and empathy are severely lacking in this company
5. There are double standards and people are treated differently i.e. if you are not on the favoured list for promotion or if you have resigned you are treated like a 2nd class employee (not able to go on company trips for example)

Company always talks about feedback culture and how it's a "people-first" company, that's ridiculous.

Cons: Where L'Oréal falls short is on its toxic culture that it has tried for years and years to change, with little to no success. Its reputation is notorious both inside and outside the organisastion. I joined as a grad, with around 30 other grads (many of them were my good friends) and I would say now only around 10% are still working there for this exact reason. Working extremely long days, with unrealistic deadlines and timeframes is not only commonplace, it is expected and demanded. I would sometimes get to my desk at 7am and not leave until 11pm. Having breakfast, lunch and dinner at your desk is something you just have to learn to get used to. Although it is worth noting that it is very much a 'work hard play hard' culture, so long hard work is sometimes offset by socials and work events (although I hear this is few and far between these days due to budget cuts).

The long hours and demanding work is not the worst aspect of the culture, however. Having only spent my professional career at L'Oréal I thought a culture of bitchiness, bullying, humiliation and disrespect was normal of every big corporation. I had no idea how wrong I was until I eventually left to go and work for another large conglomerate, which couldn't be further from this. General managers will humiliate you in large team meetings by challenging and criticising your decisions in a demeaning and derogatory way, and colleagues will throw each other under the bus to get ahead in their own career. General managers will pitch you up against your counterparts in a way that is so obvious and uncomfortable, it makes you permanently anxious and afraid that you are not living up to expectation. Despite the division being made up of majority females, CPD has a toxic masculine culture where males within the division will roast other colleagues in things like team quizzes, large email threads etc in the name of 'workplace banter'. Often this can be uncomfortable to witness, as its clearly borderline bullying, but everyone is complicit and says nothing in the name of not 'rocking the boat.' HR are fully aware and do nothing about it. At a more junior level interns and grads are given inexperienced managers who are trying to flex their new managerial muscles and make their interns miserable with harsh words, unrealistic expectations and passive aggressive emails. Personally, as an intern I would walk home nearly every day in tears, but again just thought this was part and parcel of 'normal' corporate life. 

Of course its not all bad, and I worked with some lovely colleague and managers. But for the most part I would strongly recommend you do NOT work at L'Oreal unless you have an outrageously thick skin, and if you're happy to give up your entire life to the job.

Cons: Poor medical policy, specially maternity policy for women. For a company which advertises to be equal opportunity provider, they do not believe in bearing and sharing the expense of you being promoted in your personal life. Culture is a bit skewed to favor certain chosen persons in the lot.
Advice: Equal opportunities for women cannot end at advertising the slogan. It needs to include  actions to support and bring up women in each stage of their lives.  When competitors build morale by covering all costs of medical / maternity expense, as L'Oreal we cannot back away by casually offering loans to cover the gap. It is not the same and quite de-moralizing to work for a company who does not believe in supporting employees tough times which has a huge financial implications on said employees.

There are a lot of advantages such as people culture, ethics, great offices, good salaries (however they are not competitive compared to the similar companies), additional health insurance, fresh fruit, great people and like I already mentioned, a big space for learning

Cons: Slow compensation growth, heavy workload
Advice: None
Pros: Good people and starting compensation , but slow growth

Cons: People at L'Oréal need to fit a certain mold :show-off, tell the boss he is great even if you think the opposite, laugh to jokes that are not funny and use the same expressions as everyone just like sheep, try to look just like every other employee in the company. If you do not fit that mold and if you express critical thinking towards that mold, beware : you will be pointed out as... weird.
You are told during your internship that if you have an excellent evaluation in the end, you will get hired. That is a big fat lie to squeeze the juice out of you at a low price (interns are paid much less than employees of course). The people who get hired at L'Oréal are not the best but the ones who perfectly fit the mold described in the 1st paragraph. And they say they are all about diversity...
Instead of hiring, L'Oréal relies on (cheap) interns. They are asked to take important responsabilities and commit fully to their job, but are not informed of major decisions (that they need to know to do their job correctly).
Advice: You won't get anything good out of your employees if they don't have the power to criticize.
Be honest with your interns from the start : they choose to come to L'Oréal because you promise to hire them if they deliver excellent work. If you can't keep that promise (and know you won't), I don't know what to say about your ethics.
Pros: Good salary, products for free
Leadership and responsabilites on projects
Overall, you learn a lot and companies will value you when you will look for a job if you have L'Oréal on your resume.

Cons: -Extremely stressful work environment. Everything is done last minute, no one knows who is responsible for what, and everyone is over-worked. Everything is thrown together and assigned to you at the very last minute, despite management knowing about projects months ahead of time. Pure chaos.
 
 -High turnover rate means that people are shoved into roles and there is a lack of continuity. New tasks outside of your responsibility will be assigned to you without even asking. It's hard to keep up with who is in charge of what because it changes so often.
 
 -Insufficient, disorganized, and informal training of new hires. You must constantly hunt people down to try get trained on programs and processes that are essential for you to do your job effectively. It is hard to find people willing to show you things. Management tells you to just figure it out because that's what they had to do.
 
 -Management is not open to constructive comments about process improvement. When you question the processes in place, they will tell you that "that's just how things are" and gaslight you for questioning them.
 
 -The work culture is very fictitious. They will talk about inclusion and diversity. They will send e-mails about mental health. But in reality, they promote only a certain type of people, and the high-stress work environment and lack of any structure make it difficult to maintain your mental health.
 
 -There is very little teamwork. It's every man for themselves. 
 
 -Unreasonable workload. You will be expected to juggle upwards of 20 projects at a time. Management loses track of what you are working on, so they will just assign more and more. They will not ask you if you can take on new projects, they will just forward them to you. You will receive so many big complicated projects with extremely tight deadlines that you will have a panic attack each time you get a new e-mail from certain people.
 
 -Lack of job security: the company is infamous for hiring people on contract. They want to test you out. They will string you along with the vague idea that you will eventually be hired on permanently. You will receive no health benefits and you will be excluded from additional perks such as public transit allowances. You will feel like you are not a true employee, but instead, a lower class within the workplace.
 
 -Zero transparency with staff. Management makes many "strategic" choices behind closed doors. There is always a lot of whispering and secret conversations. Everything always felt very sneaky.
Advice: -Provide formal and standardized training, tools, and resources to your employees upon hire.
 
 -Senior managers need to closely monitor middle management to ensure that their staff is happy and well-equipped with proper resources and knowledge.
 
 -Be transparent with your employees.
 
 -Recognize the hard work of your employees and thank them regularly.
 
 -Truly listen to your employee's concerns and work with them to find a solution. Do not just tell them to "figure it out" or that "that's just the way things are here".
 
 -Ensure that workloads are reasonable.

Cons: Bad Management that covers each other when they do wrong things. What you see, is not what it is. Never judge the book by its cover. Management are can able to take leave without applying on the system and drown the employee at work. Worksmart suppose to be once a week but was violated to take several times without people knowing. Management are able to watch drama and throw all the works to employee and credit themselves. Best is you can actually get your position if you have connection or ‘bribery’. Efforts will be credited to those who are not working. Is a good place for management level but bad place for employees. The turnover rate is super high that there is overlapping things not done or follow up by the previous employees. Guess how unhappy that the ex employee is. Most of all flavourism take place and drown the work to the unflavored ones which cost unstable feeling. Only good feedback are allow to show and hides the bad ones. If you could accept bad feedback there will be many who will willing to write over here. No one wants to leave for a good company but they leave because of bad managements. If you need to survive in L’Oreal you need to learn to be fake and be a ‘Yes’ man.

Cons: If you want to learn the art of politics this is the place.
It’s full of people with big egos especially management at the top. If you’re not French or French speaking/understanding at least, your chances of climbing up is pretty much zero.
During meetings French management Are incredibly rude. We had a big meeting once and junior staff were explaining things and the bosses suddenly talked to each other in french and then laughed and said we made a decision and it’s bla bla. I mean how rude and condisending?

Who you know in the company and if you’re likeable also matters hugely. When you start out in the company your pretty much are expected to schmooze and build fake relationships. If you’re good enough at playing the game, you’ll go up.

Decisions can change in an instant and all your hard work is wasted without an explanation.

They also force you to come back to office even during the COVID outbreak saying it’s the culture of L’Oréal and you can build connections better bla bla. But the reality was that work was going on perfectly fine and things were getting done.
HR is pretty useless in this company and I feel a lack of humanity and empathy.

You’ll also encounter many incompetent individuals at the managerial roles and despite all the negative comments to HR, nothing changes.

2. Salary is not good

Cons: A lot of work and meeting at the same time
Advice: None
Pros: Known worldwide, have an interesting working environment, high salary

Cons: 1. Hard to sell comparing other competitor Make-up Brand in industry.
2. Their Sales Manager of Shu Uemura is VERY RUDE and NON-CARING at all for the staffs! She only concerned about the sales target and can simply ignore your Annual Leave request (For example, "If you didn't hit your sales target this month/overhit your sales target, I won't approve your annual leave" - Even the Counter Manager approved it.
3. Too expensive! Other brands like M.A.C, Bobbi Brown are cheaper than Shu Uemura but with stunning result too.
4. The style and creativity side is not there, since is the Japanese Make-up Brand why all staff must wear an uniform but not do their own style to attract customer? (For example, M.A.C or Bobbi Brown dress whatever they like as long as is black, with stylish hair too - it makes you look professional and look like Stylist/Make-up Artist, comparing Shu Uemura it looks so far boring.)
Advice: 1. Change your attitude and be caring to your staff! Sales is a must but that doesn't mean you can use that to blackmail your staff by not giving them annual leave.
2. Bring your brand high profile! Shu Uemura is lack of promotion and PR.
3. Change the style! Let people see and get attract by your brand or your Stylist/Make-up Artist.
4. Negotiate your price! Everyone can found a similiar product with better value.
Pros: 1. One of the recognized Make-up Brand in the industry.

3. Good products.

Cons: Too many HR layers yet everything is contracted to different companies

Wellness benefits--hard to participate, too many caveats
Expectations to be in early/stay late 
Over 40 yrs old,  no room for advancement
Horrible IT systems because of our business processes 
Any challenge to an idea is regarded as 'actively disengaged' so employees must just smile and agree to the company line.
Advice: Come and see how complicated and exception laden process is.  See what it takes to create, receive and close a purchase order,  track information or just try to get a printer at closer to your desk! 

If you wonder why it takes so long to (fill in the blank to what you want), start looking at the details on why it takes so long.  Remember, 
*you lack standardized business processes
*if you do have standardized business process, pretty much every situation is an exception to the    process
*each division does things differently and everyone has good reasons why we can't
*we have to always meet with everyone 3x's and publish meeting notes before we can officially formulate a plan to expedite your request
*we have to have some more mandatory team training so we all can learn to get along

I don't know what has happened to L'Oreal in the last 4 or 5 years. This is not the same company I remember.
Pros: Company Store benefits
Medical benefits superior and relatively low cost
At local level, mgt does try to create a positive culture and show appreciation

Cons: The higher up you go, the more politics. Some teams (especially in the headquarters) are not country-centric and too much of the same profile - almost 80% of a function's committee can be all French, who have not been outside of Europe for their careers.  Harder for Asians it seems to have the same career track until a certain point in their career, then it becomes all Europeans in the post. Ethics is a campaign, but I am not sure it is embodied by everyone - especially by some leaders. Average compensation and benefits, nothing exciting.
Advice: Diversity in leadership - please commit to this and not just give the answer "we are still developing leaders in these zones." In bigger countries, the notion of being seen as an individual who can make an impact is lost - I felt this more when I worked in smaller teams.
Pros: Responsibility at a young age, and it's true that there's a lot of possibilities - you just have to remain focused on how you want to grow. Good international career in selected fields (in other functions, there may be lots of competition hence the notion that it's harder to go international). Able to handle projects that have an impact - it's true what they say, it's sometimes all up to you how you want to shape your job role and what kind of projects you want to have as your legacy. Work life balance has improved. Very strong L'Oreal culture passed on from older generations.

Cons: While you know you have Job security, if you're black that's all you have.
I work in their retail sector at one of the malls in South Africa, growth is limited, there are extreme limitations for a black/African to get a promotion if one has aspirations to work at the head offices. In the years I've spent working for them, I have observed that non-black individuals such as Indians and Whites no matter how less qualified they may be get opportunities compared to blacks, Black people are usually kept in the same position for years with no growth, like every other corporate you have to train the unqualified seniors that join the team. During this pandemic policies that apply to staff at HQ do not seem to apply at the retail level, HR is run by managers. safety precautions such as masks are not provided while HQ staff work from home and the go to the extent of pregnant retail staff keep going to work in high-risk zones. They would rather delegate responsibilities of a role that needs to be filled to existing staff than to hire or promote someone. Working hours are sometimes unrealistic especially in a pandemic when they don't consider the curfew. The management style is "Fear and intimidation" and they can go to the extent of making working conditions so difficult that they eventually resign. It's extremely toxic

As you read this you might think this is another rant about race but this is the truth. When you ignore all the other factors stated, I enjoy my job but the moment Interact with HQ management it takes the fun and drains everyone in the team.
Advice: Be fair, change your management style

Cons: very poor cross team collaboration
Advice: None
Pros: good product, leading marketing capability

Cons: Not a con per se, but it is fast-paced (as with all FMCGs).
Also, in such a big company with more than 20 brands, there is still a tendency for some to operate in silo.
Advice: Keep doing what you're doing, as long as the company keeps its vision and its heart for consumers and employees, the results will definitely show
Pros: As someone passionate in the role and the industry, I love that the work is challenging and fulfilling - you will learn new things, drive projects, develop your skills in the ever-changing landscape, and have a chance to make an impact. 

Beyond that, the company is genuine in its desire to constantly provide good environment and care for employees. 
I had heard negative things before joining the company, but after being here for some time, I think that is a thing of the past. 
The management has changed, the culture has evolved, there is a real effort to drive employee engagement, and the benefits such as flexibility to work-from-home sweeten the experience. 
I also greatly appreciate that the company is socially and environmentally conscious.

Cons: L'Oréal Canada (Montreal) is by far the worst company I've ever worked for, Here are just some reasons why:

- An infantile working environment: You'll often hear employees mocking their colleague's clothes and hair behind their back, gossiping, and acting like cliquey teenagers. In general, you don't feel like you're working with adults; you'll feel like you're back in high school.

- A lack of diversity: The majority of employees all have the same educational background, career path and personality, which often leads to groupthink.

- Red tape: Even completing the simplest tasks requires so much time and effort because of all the red tape. If you try to make things more efficient, you'll be met with "this is how it's always been done, why change it?"

- Long hours: Due to all the red tape, expect to work way over 40 hours per week, even if you're at a very junior level. When you calculate your hourly wage, you'll realize your salary is just okay. Also, you'll be paying for tea/coffee/snacks out of your own pocket, so keep that in mind while you're working all those long hours. 

- Overall obnoxious attitude: A lot of employees think they know it all because they're working at L'Oréal. But, most of them are living in a bubble and out of touch with reality and their customers. 

- Lack of collaboration: Do not expect colleagues to help you for free. You'll have to show them what's in it for them and how this can help with their career aspirations. Colleagues see others as competitors, not allies, which creates a very toxic work environment.
Advice: None
Pros: 50% off L'Oréal's many products

Cons: Too operational, manuals are not created
Advice: None
Pros: We get free products sometimes

Cons: too much politics due to the hierachy

Advice: None
Pros: Autonomy, network, professionalism and work-life balance.

Cons: Full of mean people who thinks they’re better than anyone else
Advice: None
Pros: Fashion industry and that’s it

Cons: Lack of human resources and management
Advice: None
Pros: Medical insurance and free goods policy

Cons: I did not find any
Advice: None
Pros: Nice office
Great benefits (parental leave, salary etc)

Cons: Nothing anything to say cons
Advice: No one
Pros: Vary Good Company for work

Cons: None I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Great, Excellent, Outstanding, Phenominal ,

Cons: As opposed to what I thought before coming into the company L'Oréal is run separately for their four business units (Luxury, Professional, Active Cosmetics & Consumer). They have a strange culture that doesn't allow them to fully leverage on the company's name. They like having things run the L'Oréal way and are not open to any new ideas or changes that threatens this.

Teamwork doesn't exist if you are a newcomer to the company. You will find yourself dealing with people that have many years in the company and who don't like "strangers" with weird ideas. 

No open culture to talk about problems within teams. If you say something is wrong in a meeting you'll get buried. The culture of the company is to cover your back first and then point towards someone else to blame.

REALLY , REALLY, REALLY DISORGANIZED company. This is one thing Loreal is very proud of because they love to say they are a cellular company as opossed to a process driven company such as the American ones. They hate being told that it urges to have a process and basically everything comes down to just telling the ones you like on your team what you are going to do and the rest of the people doesn´t matter. 

GOSSIP EVERYWHERE

Really bad HR team

COUNTLESS HOURS OF WORK, FORGET ABOUT WORKLIFE BALANCE. 

CONSTANTLY REDOING THINGS. ENDLESS LOOP OF NOT GETTING THING DONE AND REPLANING AGAIN, AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH NO TIME TO EXECUTE.
Advice: Be open to change and have a more welcoming environment. If you want to succeed in this era, you can no longer behave like a dinosaur.
Pros: Employee discount to buy products.

Cons: - High workload
- Not competitive salary
Advice: None
Pros: - Discount
- Office Location
- People - everyone is super friendly

Cons: L'Oréal Denmark is by far the worst employer I  ever faced. I would not recommend this company to anybody.

- Absurdly long working hours. I routinely worked 9-20. On peak times it was even worse (late night & weekend work).

- No recognition for your hard work: managers rotate country/department frequently, and their only concern is to as much performance as possible during their assignment, with complete disregard of employees job satisfaction

- Strong blame culture: managers are put under very high pressure from HQ, and instead of trying to collaborate in order to solve issues, they look for somebody to blame so that they don't get in trouble

- Salary is relatively low, especially in consideration of the high workload

- HR is utterly useless and unprofessional: many co-workers of mine were feeling miserable because of the poor working conditions. HR and Managers provided no support whatsoever, leading them to feel even more hopeless

- Total lack of structure and process thinking: lots of non-value adding and boring tasks that have to be done only to please HQ in Paris

- The high turnover rate is indicative of the level of dissatisfaction that many employees exhibit
Advice: Treat your employees like human beings and not like robots that are sitting there just to produce. Having people who feel valued and considered would benefit the company in the long term.

Working hours are too high. People burn out soon and leave the company, taking away their experience and know-how. I believe it is in the interest of the firm to prevent this.
Pros: Young and international work environment. 
This is primarily due to the fact that locals (danish speakers) can find better jobs in other firms

Cons: Workload can be heavy at some periods

Advice: improve work ethics
Pros: very good for small term growth

Advice: None
Pros: average working expereince, nothing speical. depends on your counter and floor manager

Cons: Not so week paid, not meritocratic
Advice: None
Pros: Good people good culture and good products

Cons: Not a place to work if you are looking to develop a career... 
Takes forever for a promotion (general speaking)
Many "Senior" level positions have been eliminated - leaves nothing to work towards
Management less than competent and very old school - afraid to think outside the box
Communication is sub par for a company this size and age
Raise is pretty much non existent and bonus is "profit sharing" and not based o performance
Top down corporate culture
Culture not conducive to someone that is forward thinking, risk taker, innovator (outside of R&D and product development) 
Education Assistance is dependent on what manager thinks of you - if they don't like you forget about getting assistance
Narrow minded - have been told by many people on many levels that marketing is hard to get into and they only take Ivy league or top 25 business school graduates
Diversity they rave about is not apparent - 
and the list goes on... if you want a career - don't work here...
Advice: Take a survey of your employees and find out who is truly happy and how effective management really is... Work on developing loyalty to employee - recognize and develop talent when you have it - implement continuous training and education for management -
Pros: Benefits are great - company store option, free goods, good bags on holidays and events, philanthropy and humanitarian work - some of the people are really nice- holiday schedule and summer hours that run from mid May to mid September 
Women in positions of management

Cons: I was hired at the the outcome of my interviews

Cons: It's just a pity you can't rate zero stars...

They develop L'Oreal interns and grads that ultimately move up very quickly resulting in people in high profile roles that don't have any experience of working elsewhere, and know no better than the norm which is an awful, toxic culture and rubbish short term turnover strategy. 

Development within the company is based on who you know and networking, and not at all on your skills or accomplishments. 

Hours are 9-5 but comments will be made multiple times if you don't work above these, it's all about working hard at L'Oreall, and not smart. People stay until 8pm watching Match of the Day on their screens to be seen to be staying late, and being promoted as a result. Who has time to compete with that? It's 2020 God damn.

"Feedback" is massively encouraged through trainings but I've never met a worse bunch in giving it, and receiving it. HR are absolutely nowhere to be seen, apart from with management, which is a red flag in itself.
Advice: Focus on sell out strategies and rework targets to drive this, which will ultimately drive the sell in; short term pain for long term gain etc.

Last but not least, stop plugging important issues like work life balance, ethics etc until the company makes a change, it is massively disingenuous and a lot has to change before celebrating /plugging these issues is remotely acceptable.
Pros: Free products, occasional charity and staff sales. Nice canteen and the company that run it make an exceptional effort to provide variety which doesnt go unnoticed.

Cons: Things get unstructured in Loreal due to very people oriented company
Advice: Better SOP at important processes
Pros: 1. Collaborative colleagues
2. Great benefit 
3. Exiting projects

Cons: Very hierarchical 

Low- Paid, number one complaint from all the colleagues in my team of 8 people - versus other FMCG

Bad working / life balance despite all the good efforts from HR

Heavier workload in supply chain than other departments - you ll finish at 8 pm very often and later on days of monthly transmission or KPIs reporting 

No time for analysis as operational workload is so high, many SKUs to manage, reports and inefficient processes (but it gets better)

Under- staffed

Stressful working environment 

You need to be determined, persistent and fight for your rights or you will be eaten alive

Networking counts - other divisions, departments  or other subsidiaries: you need to find time to socialize and tie lies 

Change of management every 3 years as per L'oreal policy which disrupts the flow
Advice: More staff and people's rotation in order to decrease such high turnover
Pros: People are passionate about the brands, talented and friendly 

Staff sales every 2 months on all the products (about 4000 SKUs) 

Annual Incentive trip to amazing destinations 

Very good school:  processes, reporting but you need to catch fast and learn to work on stress management and priorities 

Friendly corporate culture: launch events, annual results, citizen's day, farewell etc...

Incentive to take time on working hours for social responsible activities in the community organized by the company 

Possibilities to move to another department, division or subsidiary if good ties and recommendation from your manager

Pros: great people and an awesome brand

Cons: - Most reviews on Glassdoor have been forced to be written by the HR. I was asked to write one personally earlier too. 

- Half our campus didn’t apply because they were turned off by the attitude and sarcastic and mean nature of the HR 

- If you approach the HR for any issue while working there, the blame will be put on you and you’ll be reprimanded

- Interview was filled with sarcastic jibes and personal remarks 

- Small office 

- Very different work timings, work and ‘chill’ atmosphere from what HR claimed on campus
Advice: Be what you claim to be or don’t claim to be something else. Please don’t be so rude and sarcastic to students publicly for no reason. Your HR represents your company outside your office, please choose one who doesn’t ruin your company’s image. Our entire college has a very low opinion of your company simply because of how the HR behaved with the students. 

Your company is great. Your campus HR is not. And that ruins everything.
Pros: Well the people are pretty like minded. So if you are a certain type of person, you won’t get a more like minded bunch anywhere else. 

Very open minded people with few restrictions on clothing etc. it’s very freeing.

Cons: extremely catty work environment, no work-life balanace.

Great team competency in IT and Business

Cons: Old fashioned processes, French culture
Advice: None
Pros: Interesting brands, fast paced culture

Cons: Same objectives with a good vibe at work
Advice: None
Pros: Good school and a big family

Cons: Caliber of talent is not so high specially across Mid Levels & Juniors however a lot of work is being put to elevate the talent level across the organisation.
Advice: None
Pros: I joined L'Oreal in Beirut 2 month back in a Mid Level Managerial Position. I had worked previously in 2 other multinational FMCG companies for more than 8 years.

Prior and during my joining period, the L'Oreal HR team have made my recruitment and on-boarding very smooth, pleasant and fast. My On-Boarding plan was prepared for me prior to joining, as of my first week I had completed most of my inductions and met/ interacted with all supporting functions . 
The HR department also shared with me a clear overview on the company and welcomed me with a gift bag as a welcoming gesture. 

I quickly felt part of the team and part of the mission to turnaround my division.

My Manager, who was newly assigned to her role, was supportive and made sure to enable me when I needed and empowered me along the way.

Overall, the culture is nice, a lot of young people. I mostly interacted with my division, in which I believe the culture is quite great.

Benefits and salaries are adequate compared to multinationals in Lebanon, however in reward and recognition they are quiet generous.

A lot of support on Learning and Development from the L&D team , HR and leadership team.

Cons: The culture is really bad. People scream and curse to each other on meetings and one have no autonomy, even in higher roles such as directors, as you need to do as you're told so. People work from 8h to 23h and that seems normal and expected. If you are a fresh undergrad and really competitive, it can be a great fit. However, if you have family, especially kids, it can be really tough. I suffered psychological harassment from direct management and when searched for help, HR said this person had already made it several times before, but when confronted last time, she said she was going to change. HR confessed having no authority to do anything. So I left and even so, had to hear that "I was going to lose the job of my dreams and I would regret for the rest of my life, and they wouldn't accept me back when I come running asking for my job again". I didn't.
Advice: None
Pros: Besides the great brands and lovely products, the people there is trying their best to thrive on a fast paced company with no guidelines, no clear processes and mostly top-down policy. There is a lot of benefits, such as extra paid time off, free courses and free products (although in my country there's no way to buy what you want with discount. Forget about it!).

Cons: Pay starts ok and becomes increasingly uncompetitive
Advice: None
Pros: Learnings are amazing, stability with budgets through big brand marketing.

Cons: Can’t think of any.. :)

Cons: incentives are low need to improve
Advice: offer good incentive please
Pros: Offer good salary and expenses

Cons: Workload is heavy, and working over the weekend is quite common. 
Rapid career advancement becomes a double edged sword, as once mid level management role is reached, the organisation generally lacks role models for senior management role models to learn after. 
Processes are manual and time consuming, alot of time is wasted on paperwork
Limited structure in place, a newcomer need to make alot of effort to learn the ropes
As everyone is much occupied, on the job mentoring by senior colleagues are uncommon
Expatriation is uncommon, and even if there is, opportunities are usually given to Marketing personnel first
Advice: Seriously consider how to keep your talents that worked in the company for more than 3 years.
Pros: Possible rapid career advancement, very good for young executives who want to climb the coporate ladder fast. 
Adequate training given to individual, about 72 hours per year on average? And the quality of training is usually satisfactory
Fair company benefits, especially transport allowance for sales staff, and medical claim coverage
The organisation treasures instinct & creativity. Autonomy at your job is usually a given
Company gives real responsibilites to new comers quickly, all staff will "get into the action" within 1st month on the job
Communication from top down is usually transparent 
As the environment is tough, bonding between colleagues are usually good and last for a long time

Cons: Very fast paced around product launches. Office politics a must to work your way around issues. Guidance is vague many times, must be able to 'figure it out'. A tough culture for newbies, takes a while getting used to, getting the means to do your job, knowing who does what. Standards of execution are not set straight to entire teams, it's a company that allows each employee to fill objectives in the way they see fit - this has it's pros and cons. High employee rotation. Recognition is achieved by not only doing excellent work, but also by being able to show it off in the right way.
Advice: Clearer guidance and more proximity to all levels of the organization. Stronger compensation.
Pros: L'Oreal is the big entrance to the cosmetics industry. Gives knowledge and insight, allows you to work as the market leader with the retailers. Informal and fun corporate culture. Provides opportunity of responsabilty and execution to anyone - there is much to be done and job descriptions are vague. Extending one's influence is up to you. A great start to a career, after a few years at L'Oreal you are an asset to many companies. A passionate industry to work in, innovative. Allows exposure to top management and to influencing directly the results of a product launch very soon in one's career.

Cons: - Malaysia HR managers in long tenure are too political and can sometimes seem unethical in behaviour and remarks. 
- A lot of people agenda needs to be driven by business leaders on their own will poor support from HR. No clear intent on people agenda. Which results in turnover of people. 
- Work scope can overlap at times which creates unnecessary complications. 
- Long hours but it is individual choice due to flexible working style and not forced by company
Advice: - Look into stronger HR leaders as many other markets in region have advanced
- Continue driving transparency in managing situations. 
- Ensure right and proper roll out of new culture project
Pros: - Dynamic business - beauty is ever growing and fuelled by innovation and advancement of digital space - which the company is leveraging well on. 
- Open culture - matrix structure which means individuals don't need to push for visibility. 
- Stable industry and business. Constantly growing ahead of industry pace for the past few years. Lots of potential in Malaysia market. 
- Great Brands and vision - very clear ambition by group and local in terms of business. 
- Great career progression if performance and potential. Inspiring to see peers exported to other markets as well as exposure received. 
- Lots of room to drive and bring changes. Senior management on business side always open to new ideas.

Advice: None
Pros: Good compensation. Good salary. Time

Cons: Kinda sucks one word two words
Advice: None
Pros: I get paid with money

Cons: 1.) I wouldn't call it a con but you must be willing to work hard - it is not an einvorment that is friendly to people who aren't willing to put in their fair share.
Advice: None
Pros: 1.) Responsibiliy - whether it be doing analysis for crucial meetings, or managing my own projects, the level of discretion given to even junior levels is impressive. I have found myself creating assets for pivotal internal/external meetings, and also managing several of my own projects.

2.) Work-environment - as long as you are willing to work hard, it is a very rewarding environment to work. It is very much work hard / play hard and this has helped anchor my lifestyle to being energetic. The people are extremely friendly and welcoming. An environement that really is design to make new employees thrive.

3.) Career progression - The fast moving environment transcends to career movement, which means that your career can be boosted very quickly. It also provides many opportunities to begin your career abroad or in a development role. 

4.) Variety - There are so many different roles/jobs/people/benefits that it isn't possible to get bored. I have been working for over half a year, and I haven't looked at the clock once!

Advice: None
Pros: The remuneration and atmosphere is really good

Cons: Rotation shifts, long hours commuting
Advice: None

All woman
Advice: None
Pros: Hard working people, Fun, fashionable, leading company

Cons: - They work you like a slave, work life balance is terrible and the management always asks for more than you but never acknowledges your efforts (for them it's normal that you work so late), no gratification for your work
- No support from management
- HR are useless and not helpful
- Not international at all (Switzerland is a very small market with very limited budget, can be quite frustrating during international meetings when you see what other markets can do)
- Burnouts are very common (at least once a month)
- Extremely high turnover
- 0 benefits or perks (apart from free products)
- Very low salary for swiss standards
- Low career opportunities: you will change brands very quickly and they will change your title but come a certain point you won't be able to have such a high position as they are limited in number
Advice: Hire more staff as all teams are understaffed, care more about the team's well being, don't put so much pressure (it's just a jar of cream at the end of the day), if you want to overwork your teams then you should reward them with a higher salary or perks
Pros: Everybody is young (25-30ish), good atmosphere, colleagues get along, free products, you get to make strategic decisions

Cons: - VERY organic, no structure whatsoever they like to call it "Organizational Chaos" and pretty proud of it. This company is for you if you are resilient, and can adapt to changes. This might be too much after a couple of years. 
- Highly competitive and it's hard to find work/life balance.
- Toxic work culture. Work culture is oriented to confrontation. If you don't like to be challenged and like to defend your ideas it might not be the place for you (I did like that)
- Nobody will tell you what and how to do something. You need to be highly proactive and get your way through people
- Above pay rate of the rest of multinationals. Other companies pay better.
Advice: The company has more than 100 years, and it needs structure in order to people not to be burnout. The amount of workload and the little pay makes your employees leads to a 100% assurance of a burnout.
Pros: - Work with amazing and iconic brands. If you are into cosmetics, you might enjoy it a lot. 
- Great company to learn about marketing. I can say this is the best company if you want to work and learn in Marketing. However, it's a really hands-on job. Very holistic job
- Easy to grow within the company (as long as you show results)
- A young organization, therefore I found long-lasting friendships

Cons: Very stressed il and carry ambience r
Advice: Nonce
Pros: Good insurance and good bonuses overall

Advice: None
Pros: Strong branding. Nothing worth highlighting.

Cons: busy busy busy work overtime
Advice: None
Pros: fast paced environment, you will learn a lot.
good benefits

Cons: - Management and director team who are not open to new ideas
- Very under resourced team
- Long hours... not unusual to do a 60 hour week, and it is somewhat expected to cover the workload
- A high number of interns and graduate scheme individuals - whilst this is great for them to learn working life, the reality is that you have a lot of inexperienced people who are involved in some business critical tasks
- Extremely cut-throat - weekly sales and marketing meetings would tend to have someone leaving at the end in tears (not even joking)
- Rare for all to get their full bonus. Always seemed like an extra hoop to jump through whether you had hit your objectives or not
- Low salary for the location... to have NAMs on circa 40k and SNAMs on 50k does not pay to stay
Advice: Realise that the work hard-play hard expectation does get tiresome after a while. A lot of good, talented people leave within 2 years or so because they've just had enough. Put more staff into your teams and let people enjoy a life outside of work and you will get a lot more from your teams.
Pros: - Vast range of brands
- Product discounts (50% off via the staff shop)
- Young, energetic team
- Relatively central office (Hammersmith)

Constant feedback

Learning opportunities

Cons: poor work environment poor management high work load
Advice: None
Pros: nice aesthetics. freebies training opportunities

Cons: not very good in decision making
Advice: in many things such as decision making
Pros: very big stucture in many countries

Cons: The CIO had no CIO experience.  The value or lack of value that he places on supporting teams with IT is felt.  He determines his monthly direction on what Gartner publishes.  Therefore there is little direction.  The budget you are allocated is a joke, yet they expect you to make a difference.  You have to explain every single penny and there is little money for new ideas...unless you are of course in the area of IT which he feels is valuable.  He believes he is into team building when the truth is he has little time for anyone.  Department communication is non existent and you have no idea what other parts of IT are working on.  If you are looking for an opportunity to learn and grow...this is not the place to do it.  IT is not highly regarded and up until June of 2011 IT was not part of senior management strategic committee.   If someone in your department leaves the CIO takes the headcount and moves it to the part of IT he feels is more valuable.
Advice: get rid of some of the senior people that are bringing the company down.  360 on Senior Management in HR and IT
Pros: industry
exciting products
Senior Management of some brands are very intelligent
If you are from Europe there is a lot of room for movement and for growth....if you are from the US,,,,,basically forget about it.
Frederic Roze is an efficiency expert, just concerned about cutting costs.

Cons: Not enough level of average salary
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: - Work environment is very positive.

Cons: Long working hours all the time
Advice: None
Pros: Get to work with smart people

Cons: workload too much, a lot of agenda
Advice: less stressful
Pros: good discount, nice office, work from home benefit

Cons: Long hours for full time employees, especially in Marketing.  I see people working very late into the evening, even weekends, with no overtime whatsoever.  Lots of people get stressed out when International people come for visits.  The cafeteria charged high prices for some of the food items.  Lots of gossiping inter-departmental which I did not like much.  Promotions did not always seem to be based on performance as office politics do play a part in the whole ordeal.  Lots of turnovers in the company as those who have worked 2 or 3 years can now get better jobs with higher pay.
Advice: Rid of office politics and offer more productive feedback.
Pros: Discounts on products; inside coffee house; plasma TV to watch games during World Cup, clean/fashionable work environment, great open space.... LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!! Right in the middle of StCatherine and University, it is probably the best location in my humble opinion for a company to have.  On top of the Eaton Center, and within walking distance of all amenities, I could not ask for more.  During the summer, it is very nice as you can get out of the office and go for a nice leisurely stroll downtown and still be back for work in the afternoon.  Very nice view from the office as well.

Cons: No cons no cons no cons
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible work ours, good good good

Cons: messy internal operation , no clear roadmap and direction can make you feel unsure and confuse, weak sales network & over-depend on marketing to deliver results , lack clear & long term vision & big pisture perspective , do not synergize & pool resources efficiently between division / brands / channel , do not emphasis effiency at organization & personal level ,  poor fanancial reporting accuracy , weak supply chain management , poor internal communication , promotions criterias questionable , demoralized work force , do not bring 'play hard' culture to actual working , people lack solid industry experience , too much app;e-polishing culture , has some weird & rigid processes
Advice: be more agressive, serious and fast in addressing weakness
Pros: strong international brands that are widely recognixed , exposure to european company to motivate you to learn about new culture & language , staff purhase , ocassional freebies treat , good health benefit , recognize need for change , open culture ,  high standards in brand communication , strong technology & R&D behind products , representation in many business sectors within cosmetic & beauty hence a true expert , young & energitic hence you could say less politic depends on how you see it , opportunity to develop career in different divisions which could mean a richer work experience ,  fast promotion

Cons: Too many working hours overload workload
Advice: None
Pros: Good company, good salary, improve

Cons: hight performance expectation, low support to achieve this
Advice: None
Pros: benefits, good environment to work

Cons: Top down pressure and unrealistic deadlines
Advice: None
Pros: Hard working team and collaborative

Cons: You are only as good as your last presentation. Your managers and HR are constantly judging you and putting you in categories- Fast track? Poor performer? Be prepared to play politics...hard. If you don’t want to play the game-get out. Bravo you’ve been promoted to a new division. Not really. Now you have to re-prove yourself all over again. I’ve heard it over and over again - everyone is replaceable. Nope you aren’t special.  Sorry. Transparency is not king. Everything is hush hush. Rumours are constantly flying.
Advice: For some reason you are able to recruit some pretty amazing people. Treat them that way. You are spending so much energy trying to recruit new talent, what about trying to retain your old talent? No one should be allowed to belittle their employees but I have seen managers do it time and time again. Unfortunately they are still there. Their employees aren’t. Hmmm??
Pros: The people that work here for the most part (barring HR and top management) are great! You have the opportunity to work on some pretty cool projects. Location of office is amazing and very central.

Cons: -no work / life balance 
-v long hours 
-political, if you are not in the 'clique' you will not progress well in this company
-no transparency on salary bands, you have to fight for increase at every opportunity given
-if they want you to leave they make this obvious - via unwarranted capability process or just limiting your progression so you feel you have no choice but to leave
-high pressure which leads to a very stressful environment 
-large workload but small teams due to limited headcount
-meeting charters not respected, not unusual to have a meeting commence at 6pm
-there is a need to permanently cover your back by cc'ing all into e-mails or following up any phone calls with a written e-mail
-as an employee you do not feel valued, you feel replaceable
Advice: 1. Your employees are your assets- remember that.
2. GM's -you need to manage your egos.
3. Before pointing a finger of blame at an employee, look at the assets/resources they are given to do their job.
Pros: -Discounted products
-looks great on CV
-good opportunities to learn
-can move into international roles

Cons: Too much favouritism and hate politics. More attention is paid to your image rather than what you bring forth to the table. It's like working in a chawl filled with dumb fashionistas.
Advice: Cut down on your extravagant expenditures. France must get a hold on employees and mancomm's leave structures and attendance. Install finger swyping. Ppl work for two days in a week and get paid for five and still have leave balance at the end of the year. Get accountability in order. There is too much favouritism and undercut in employing vendors, consultants etc which is a known industry fact. All business is routed through vendors who give a cut to the management and everyone knows that. It's just a given. You will survive well here only if you are dishonest or good looking. Unfortunately, that's the kind of employees the HR seeks and prefers to tame. Mr. Agon, you're not only running  Loreal globally, but also running the homes of your India Mancomm, which don't run on their salaries but on your company's expenses. Personal expenses are billed to company and shown as company expenditures. HR is well aware but won't do anything. Till the time the entire Mancomm and senior management is not reshuffled or refurbished, this company will not report the profits it's capable of reporting.
Pros: Good work life balance and discounts on products.

Cons: - Progression is fixed - no faster than two years
- The company is still extremely digitally illiterate and slow on the uptake of digital
- Lack of processes, so it's chaotic, inefficient, and unproductive
- Employee welfare is not a priority for HR, neither does the culture focus on this. Everyone eats at their desks way too much, concerns about working hours are dismissed, there is very little appreciation for what you do
- Marketers are really more project managers who implement diktats handed to them from the central Paris office with no meaningful creative or strategic input
- Culture is competitive, not collaborative
- Cliquey 
- If you don't fit their overly prescriptive mold (extroverted, into sport, drinking and going out to bars and clubs every waking moment, lack of intellectual interests), you will not fit in or last
Advice: Define what the culture is, look after employees, fix inefficiencies, get up to speed with how marketing is now done, allow individuality to flourish
Pros: - The morning walk as you approach the building with the L'Oréal logo above gives you that five seconds of glam you so crave.

Cons: - highly demanding with long hours due to lack of process and meeting inefficiency.
- strong culture can be very hard to adopt when coming from other companies. micromanagement from top executives down to the smallest execution details.
- short term and internal decision making process can get in the way of long term gains.
- interpersonal leadership skills dont always determine who gets promoted.
Advice: - take specific, measurable actions behind existing programs to improve work/life balance so that teams see quick wins of it.
- reward managers with team leadership skills: broaden manager's evaluation criteria beyond business results, making teams take an active role in the evaluation of their managers with an impact on their current and future career moves.
Pros: - fast learning curve, very dynamic and changing environment that fosters challenging how things are done (faire et refaire pour mieux faire) with the means and resources to make ideas happen. 
- focus on results, not process.
- young, international teams who are passionate about the beauty industry and forging strong networking relationships with their coworkers. 
fast paced careers with international and very flexible paths.
- increasing focus on social/environmental/ethical impact at all levels of the company, strongly promoted by top management.

Cons: &gt; No Handover, No Notes, No Support
&gt; HR have their heads in the clouds about the state of not only the business, but also the state of their own department.
&gt; Either non-existent or not very robust commercial controls/checks/balances
&gt; I was lied to in order to get someone to accept the role that I accepted - i should have known it would be a nightmare based on all of the experiences of colleagues and friends of mine that have either worked there or been exposed to its culture
Advice: Stop resting on your laurels, good product alone isnt going to keep L'Oreal alive - not only are you losing good talent but will find it difficult to attract and retain good talent if you dont look inwards at what you could and should fix within the business. Also need to look at the knowledge levels of people in the business that advise clients and professionals on your product - I have been made aware of numerous occasions where "Technical Support" tell people on the phone that "they are the last to know". Fix this, as Salons and professionals are moving away from your product now because you cannot support them. No Sales = No Business.
Pros: None whatsoever - this was an absolute waste of my time.

Cons: - Long working hours. Most of sales do a 10 hour day as a minimum and this is only getting longer (I usually start at 8/8:30am and finish at 7pm), meaning I'm too tired most nights to socialise and switch off. Sales contracts are 35 hours per week...
- Management are very slow to make decisions and often seem to be looking out for themselves by wanting a large amount of information. This can mean that we annoy the retailers and miss opportunities
- More concerned with market share than profit
- Low pay for the market (between £5k and £10k less compared to our competitors), no overtime or days in lieu for all the extra hours
- Little collaborative approach to issues or problems. Those in sales are expected to come up with the answers individually and then present to management, but then of course they're slow to act
- L'Oreal is a very 'lean' company = not enough people to make all the work = sales teams work long hours
Advice: None
Pros: + Job moves happen frequently due to people leaving so there's always something new to get stuck into
+ Agile working means that you can work out of the office once in a while
+ Lots of NPD and new initiatives to keep you busy
+ Ambitious individuals

Cons: 1) 0 work-life balance (meaning you will be expected to work evenings, weekends, holidays, etc...) 
2) HR policy is as follows: a) hire new grads, b) pay them low salaries and work them 60 hour/week, c) they'll stick around anyway because they want the experience and they fell for the "OMG I work at L'Oreal how cool", d) once they've burned out or found normal paying or normal hour jobs elsewhere they'll leave, e) replace them with the next new grad, f) repeat. Different story with management though, I hear they invest in their managers.
Advice: Wow, where do I begin....
a) Hire more people! Maybe than your turnover rate won't be astronomically high! You're loosing money retraining new hires all the time anyway!
b) Pay new grads a decent salary, I know they're easily replaceable, but they're also the backbone of your organization, so invest in your non-management employees.
Pros: 1) good learning opportunity.
2) it's a well known company so it does look good on your resume, but no better or worse than any other well known company.
3) everyone is so overworked and bitter that, ironically, it makes for good conversation and lots of good laughs with the people that you work with.

Cons: I originally started working for another L'oreal brand, which I loved, and am going to write a separate review for. When they decided to merge our brands together, it came with new management, who were complete bullies. They claimed to care about your mental health, and how you're finding it, but in the next breath would belittle you, threaten and bully you. Within the span of an hour, I was told I had no talent, that I was never a makeup artist, and would only benefit from small, unknown brands outside of L'oreal. The way the company treated staff who weren't management was disgusting. Two members of staff were signed off with stress in one month due to the way this brand treats people. I truly loved L'oreal when I started working for them, but never again would I consider working for this despicable company.
Advice: Actually care about your employees. Don't pretend to in attempts to save face. Stop letting in store management take advantage (Going home early, Taking Lieu time they never accrued, getting other employees to do their job for them, ETC). The bullying towards younger staff is appalling, considering they will be the future of your brand. Also, keep your promises of progression
Pros: Staff Shop
Allocation (If you ever got all of it)

Cons: Team, manager, environment, daily tasks
Advice: None
Pros: A very good annual salary

Cons: Russian office is suffering a lot during last 2-3 years. Marketing teams had been completely changed several times, brand managers came and just in some time leave the company, they simply rejected to work in such conditions. The main reason: lack of strategic thinking behind actions. Top management is undoubtedly very professional, but middle management and especially their attitude to their teams leave much to be desired. A good place to start career but do not recommend to come from another company
Advice: Invest in people, start to treat staff as main company's asset. Brand and products are nothing if there is no good team behind, especially in marketing
Pros: Fantastic products and brands, outstanding brand development teams in DMI, consequently plenty of innovations that continuously launching on the market. Also since this is beauty company, that beauty touch is felt everywhere. In Russian office you can be promoted really fast and become marketing director in your 30 (but actually I doubt that this is a good point)

Cons: There's a lot of pressure and since it's a very changing, fast paced enviroment not everyone resist the pressure. People can be a little too stressed or too pressure mainly during the seasons.
Advice: Be closer to the people; challenge your teams but give them tools to grow and improve with the company. Listen to them and make people a priority because that's were the results come from.
Pros: It's a company with a great work enviroment, very young, fast paced and creative. All ideas are welcome and you feel truly appreciated and truly listened even when your ideas are not implemented they always listen to you. The Ethics departement is constantly checking everyone is treated farly and respectfully and they are very accesible. The products are great wich adds a lot of fun to the work, sometimes they give frees samples to the employees so you can try them. It a very fast paced company so you are challenged to constantly developing new skills and improving the way you do things.

Cons: You will only get commission if you hit the sales target per month. If you don't, the basic pay is akin to getting paid peanuts. And the sales target only rises every month. 
Have to travel everywhere depending on which location you get dropped to.
Peer pressure. 
Not for anybody who's in for fast cash. You need passion, guts and a face made of steel for this job. It gets rewarding in the long run as you get more experienced.
Advice: Change your part time clock in system from a written one to a fully digitalised one. I hope you have already. Other than that, solid job.
Pros: Pretty cushy job as you are only required as a part timer to sell and introduce products to prospective clients. 
Supportive HR
Every location has a different type of customer and target audience, so you get to interact with all sorts of people.
Pretty high commission.
You get to use and sample the products.
You get training, and that helps to prepare for your work.

Cons: Hierarchy has no transparency in modus operandi. Totally dishonest and pass on the ball at higher management level. How come Mancomm can be so blind, that they do not realise the ground zero reality. You cannot be a fannatic in approach. HR is only for the name sake as they have no other jobs than to send employee joining details. Because of some higher management people, the entire credentials of the business operation of Loreal is at stake and attrition rate of ground zero guys are substantially high. Even repute in market has gone done and its impossible to recruit talented manpower for 1st and 2nd line ff under Loreal banner.
Advice: Please reveiw it as people leaving the pool have no gain other than helping you to retain the existing talent you have left with. Also down size the bunch of highly paid non deserving Managers to retain the left so called Culture and Values of Loreal.
Pros: I experienced no pros , other than great Brands.

Cons: Many members of management are not great leaders
The vision is not always clear 
Can be slow to implement change on "must-haves" 
Base salaries not competitive and lack transparency to salary scale
HR does not work with you but against you to meet their own objectives and not the company's
Need to do a great deal with small budgets
Advice: Scratch the surface of your leadership team. Too much "smoke and mirrors" and lack of real substance
Provide more growth opportunities to your senior management. 
Align your HR team to company goals and department requirements. Make them listen to what is truly needed. Involve them more in the business to reduce making bad hiring decisions which affect team morale and company revenues.
More transparency from the top
Pros: Very entrepreneurial which allows you to learn a great deal
Lots of freedom to implement initiatives
Great offices and location
Many opportunities to move within the company
Access to great products
Many employee-focused benefits (work from home, discounts, benefits, pension)

Cons: - Bullying, cliques of people
- No work-life balance and extreme workload
- No humanity, you are a number and always replaceable 
- They only care about numbers, not about the employees
- Not ethical, even though they claim to be
- HR does not care about you, they listen to the higher ups. 
- You will work weekends all the time and it is never enough. 
- If you divide your salary with the amount of hours, you make less than minimum salary
- Prepare yourself for international VP visits during which you will not sleep for over a month
- Only for extraverts, A type personalities. 
- They want everyone to be the same, they do not focus on strengths.
Advice: The culture of this company needs to change. Treat your employees like humans, not slaves. Care about your people. I was bullied by my own boss for 2 years and HR did nothing so I left. Ended up in a burnout. Trust me, it's NOT worth it.
Pros: - Good on your CV
- Learn to be a slave, so all your future jobs with seem easy 
- Bonus and benefits are good

Cons: - Beyond my team (ie the nerdy ones :-) ) it felt like I was living in the Devil Wears Prada
- Not a very hardworking atmosphere
- Employees were not always appropriate (behaviour, clothes etc) for a working environment
- Culture of interns (not my team) doing boring and bottom of the pile work til late
- Very transient work force, people come and go so quickly development is slow
Advice: Better communication channels between the different brands and global teams (scientific, legal etc). 
Individual's responsibility to set up an organisational map of when people come and leave jobs
Pros: - Lots of women so a very different to usual working environment 
- My team were VERY friendly and helpful (not all teams were)
- Very work load conscious and careful that I was still enjoying my summer break
- Lots of care given to the type of projects I was working on so that they were interesting
- TONNES OF FREEBIES AND FREE HAIRCUTS/MANICURES etc

Cons: - Horrible work-life balance.  Be prepared to make work your priority in life.
- No leadership, only incompetent directors and managers.  No vision, no original thoughts, no mentoring.  Upper management only acts as the metrics police with no strategy or ability to improve their functional area or the overall business.
- Disfunctional environment with unrealistic expectations.  Get more done with less.  Demand improvement without change.  Collaboration amongst departments is below standard.
- No autonomy or respect for experience and creativity.  Better do it the L'Oreal way.
- Micromanaged by the executives who visit too often just to overstate the obvious and continuously change the focus and direction of the plant initiatives.
- Unhealthy conflict is encouraged and viewed as a strength in those who thrive in arguments.
- Pretend to invest in new systems and ideologies.  In reality, the business continues to be mismanaged the same way for years.  It's all wasted money on poorly executed initiatives and programs led by consultants.
Advice: Thank goodness for a strong brand name that can absorb the inadequacies of a deficient management group.
Pros: - Good medical and benefits
- Company store

Cons: some managers doesn't give the real appreciations no matter how hard worker you are, there is some communication issues between the managers and their teams. my manager wasn't supporting me all the time. the HR as much as they are doing the best to make the work place better but they didn't take a considerations when it's comes to any reasons why people get terminated.
Advice: please give your team a space to breath and to speak up freely about the negative points and listen to them when it comes to what they feel and what they think when it's related to the work and the business, for the HR please ask the employee about the real reason why they cannot work smoothly with their managers. and before you decide to terminate  anyone make sure that you have investigate enough to be fare.
Pros: Career Opportunities , Benefits, Culture, Diversity

Cons: Not much training. You're expected to come in swim or sink.
High turnover (internal and external) - Next thing you know people you deal with everyday is moving on to a new role or quit.
Bonus is meager, unless you're senior mgmt.
Advice: They have to value their employees more. I see too many good people get poached from competitors, which means that the company is not being compensated/recognized very well. It doesn't make sense to develop an employee for several years and then lose them to a competitor for nothing but a small promotion or $10-$15K raise (I mean, that's practically nothing to the company in monthly terms).
Pros: Global company (you can transfer to other locations/countries).
Good place to build a network, whether for relationships within the company or later on in the career.
Recognized name in the industry so it's good when you want to move on.

Cons: Not so great on mapping processes, handovers, and hiring the best person for the job. Manager's skills vary a lot, so depending on which team you are at it can be great or not so much. They still don't have 360 reviews, which could help the company to find out how their managers perform. Be prepared for a lot of overtime, rather a hectic day time and never-ending changes. The HR team is not what can be expected from the company at that level. Quite a lot of people getting stressed out and sick.
Advice: Managed by example, be aware of stress levels at your teams and do something about it instead of talking about it. Less talking more action. Implement 360 to see how your managers are performing.
Pros: Great international and friendly environment. The best company if you like working in teams and have lots of professional colleagues. Work equipment and workplace top of the range. Very modern and new tech from building to equipment to leading style. Plenty of place for carrier and personal development which is a steep learning curve. It is a fast-changing company which is both good and bad.

Cons: Part of our culture is that we rely more people and personal networks than systems and process. This can create a feeling that things are not always smooth or defined. It is not considered a bad thing for the organization, as it has worked for more than 100 years, but it is not always easy for newcomers to understand. You have to be someone that wants to work in ambiguity and constant change.
Advice: None
Pros: My favorite part of the L'Oreal culture is the never-ending quest to create and innovate. No matter what your job is, you will be expected to find new and better ways to work and to challenge the old way of thinking. Leadership is more accessible than most companies of similar size, and top managers encourage junior staff to disagree with them and create an opportunity for debate - this is how we get our best ideas! One of the perks is that you will never need to buy any beauty or grooming products (at least not a full price). There always seems to be free goods or you can shop in the L'Oreal company stores.

Cons: Unsustainable work environment that won't survive the shifts in expectations coming from millennials. 

After almost 10 years at the company I feel like I have seen it all at L'Oréal. Even though I left the company grateful I also left it exhausted. I have experienced being harassed, bullied and awarded all in one day and that is not a unique situation, its expected.
Advice: Hire, promote and train leaders that can do more than manage their operational tasks at hand. Promote the ones who actually lead, develop talent sustainably and empower. You can only rely on the excuse of "the French work style" for so long. What is the real reason your turnover amongst newly hired is so high? 

Develop next generation leaders instead of just marketeers and you will be invincible.
Pros: The most fun I have ever had at a job. Expect to spend your day laughing in the best possible company. Great challenges to overcome and every day is different. 10 years, 3 countries and 5 positions later - this company taught me everything I know about sales, marketing and digital. Best thing? If you have an amazing idea you will always be allowed to develop it.

Cons: While in some companies management trainees have their own projects, a lot of departments where you get your rotations treat you as a free labor to do the most boring work. Many managers don't understand that you are paid twice as much as a basic intern, and it would be more useful for the company and the trainee to give more interesting projects with some responsibility. So my advice is to ask upfront for a specific project (as it will help you gain management experience), and avoid routine work which people just try to get rid of (it doesn't teach you anything and doesn't bring any value) or try to share it, otherwise your motivation will dissapear very soon.
It seems also that headcount in some departments is not right at all - some people work till 9-10 p.m. very often, while others always leave at 6 p.m. (not because they are more efficient)
Advice: Develop a specific program for each trainee with projects they can be solely responsible for. Tell managers that it's a waste of resources to give a lot of routine work to management trainees (they are paid sometimes more than junior brand managers and more than most "specialist" positions)
Pros: A lot of nice people, no dress code, free lunch

Cons: 1. The internship is real hard work, especially when you're in the sales team. It'll drive you crazy to fulfill the sales target. 
2. You get a lot pressure if you want to be outstanding within the team. So you get emotional every now and then. 
3. They do have great culture, but they're not open for mistakes, you can't have any excuse if you don't get your job done.
Advice: When I was working there, I didn't get any mentor around me, I made mistakes and I fixed them. The HQ didn't really care about each of its employees that much.
Pros: 1. If you're a current college student in China, especially a junior one, it'd be a great opportunity for you to apply for Summer Intern at L'Oreal Group. It challenges you a lot no matter which department you'd work for. And it'll help a lot for the later interview process of their Management Trainee Program. 
2. Great HR team, really professional, they advise you and help you prepare everything. 
3. Once you get involved in their Management Trainee Program, you'll have smooth career advancement if you do work hard. And the working environment is great, you'll see your peers are all professional and outstanding.

Cons: - overtly aggressive corporate culture. Always a sense of urgency 
- work life balance is non-existant
- Not introvert friendly, must be over the top and fake to fit in. Sheep-like atmosphere.
- paid for 40 hrs however the workload of my collègues and I require 60-65 hours per week
- good for people under 30 only. Not family friendly as this company simply does not respect having a life outside of loreal 
- company leaves a ridiculous amount of responsibility on junior level employees with little to no support from upper levels or mentors. They then pass it of as “entrepreneurial”
- Half of the company  consists of expats from France who have nothing here and have nothing better to do than work 13 hrs a day
- departments work in silos
- more time spent in meetings that working on your desk
Advice: Your corporate culture is toxic and flawed and if not fixed employment will be a continuous revolving door.
Pros: - competitive salary 
- good Benefits
- good school (get to reinvent the wheel for many projects and processes)
- good brand on your CV
- flex hours, work from home, and summer hours
- Not micro managed and left to make decisions that impact the business.

Cons: Micro management
Need to speak French
Lack of innovation unless you work in Paris
No strategic value unless you are a senior manager in Paris
Some people have been promoted simply as they have been there a long time even if they lack any common sense and judgement
They never think you'll leave
Some senior managers will not even recognise junior people's exsistence
The CEO thinks this therefore you think this
Advice: Look for the young bright sparks and promote them accordingly not purely on time accrued  
Take on management consultants, they are expensive but they will make you more efficient
All countries do not operate the same, a product may work in one place and not in another, local staff need to be able to speak up
Senior management from Paris need to hit reality, dare to speak to some junior people and ask them honestly what they think not just the people trying to impress you to get your jobs.
Pros: Responsibility for a project
The girls
The name of your resume
Potential to progress quickly due to high turnover of staff

Cons: Politics
Lack of effective systems and technology
Lack of headcount - there are too few people to achieve the objectives set for the business by Paris
Workload and expectations are huge
Lack of process and an air of confusion about who is responsible for what which is disguised as flexibility and creativity
Graduate and intern recruitment is huge which sometimes gives an overriding feeling of immaturity and lack of experience.
Pay is much lower than market average
Advice: Increase headcount and give people the opportunity to excel at what they do. Currently, people are too busy trying to cram in the basics to reveal their true flair.
Invest in systems that work and spend money on making them appropriate for the business. Currently, a business process that works is being altered and adapted to suit the system.
Diversity needs to be considered more, from a politically correct standpoint, but also from the perspective of the 'type' of person being employed. Everyone is very similar in terms of their approach and personality.
Pros: Great brands that people are genuinely passionate about
Great events and parties - emphasis on fun
Lots of responsibility for those who want it
Lovely staff shop and freebies
People are constantly open to change and new ways of doing things

Cons: -very stressful environment
-too busy to train new employees
-people are not so welcoming, too much backstabbing and gossiping
-life revolves around work, don't expect a personal life
-high turnover, can't keep employees 
-HR lies to new recruits, promises them of a dream job
-Most workers are young, because they are mostly fresh from university or have little experience, still naive, but they soon realize the L'Oreality and leave.  A new set of young naive recruits enter and another set of overworked tired workers leave...this cycle never ends.
Advice: Hire more people, the problem is that people leave due to high stress because there's not enough personnel.  You will always have people leaving if you don't listen to their needs.  Everyone is swamped with work. Stop focusing on production for a moment and try focusing on the real  and bigger problem: employees well-being.  If you ask every single employee if they are satisfied, they will tell you they hate this place.  You only realize how brutal L'Oréal is once you get to work there, otherwise, it seems like the ideal place, bunch of bullcrap.
Pros: -Good starting salary
-discount on products
-unlimited overtime

Cons: -Long hours; you will often have to work long hours. This can be a positive or a negative, as if you enjoy your job then there are always new and orginal tasks to be done. However, if you are not accustomed to longer hours, then I can imagine it being an inconvenience.
Advice: -Provide more training courses to interns.
Pros: -Responsibility; from your first week there shall be a considerable amount of responsibility handed to you, allowing an individual to make a significant difference within the business from an early stage
-Atmosphere; the work atmosphere in the office is warm and lively, everyone in the office are very approachable and more than happy to help
-Challenges; if you want to take on a new and exciting challenge, teams are very open to giving you project opportunities that shall help you develop in the direction you are interested in
-never the same; every day is different in the office, when you walk into the office, you can predict about 30% of your day, the rest is often new and exciting challenges that will ensure you are never bored

Cons: Long hours - but this is improving with strategies like summer working hours (finishing at 3pm on Fridays)
If you don't enjoy a highly changeable and fast moving environment - L'Oreal may not be a good choice as an employer - you need to love change and be very flexible
Communication is really important - you cannot rely on emails to build relationships - you have to build networks to get the best results
Advice: Sometimes expectations are so high that managers can forget to show appreciation of effort put in.  What would be considered a 'great' performance in other companies is often only considered a 'good' performance at L'Oreal.
Pros: Meritocratic environment - if you are a great performer your career will fly
'Can-do' attitude - very solutions focused
Networked environment - you can get decisions made very quickly
Exciting environment - hundreds of launches every year
Not proceedural - you have a lot of room to make decisions and stretch the boundaries of your role
Passionate people - creates an inspiring environment

Cons: Who really wants to work get overloaded with little recognition. All evaluations will tell you how great you are but you salary you remain the same for as long as they can keep it that way. All teams are always understaffed.
Advice: Get a better HR team. 
Most of the managers are really young and do not have a clue about managing.
If there is a department where every employee is working 20 extra hours for the past 10 weeks, it means that they are understaffed! No need to wait 2 years to get to this conclusion!
Make the decision process faster. I understanding it is a big company, but sometimes it is better to choose a path, even if it is not the best one rather than not choose at all.
Marketing must have freedom, but they also must know what they should do.
Operations needs processes. All freedom must have limits.
Pros: Great place to learn. L´Oréal is a company that encourages employees to do their best and be owners of their projects. I never thought that I would have so much freedom to do my work.

Cons: -Lack of direction & leadership will wear you down- be warned.
-Very strange culture across particular divisions- high focus on 'boys club' & overseas people are often bought into the country rather than promoting from within or local talent options.
-Very long hours with lack of reward or recognition for people's contribution- a lot of talk around fixing this but highly unlikely until they change the management in particular divisions. Note- summer hours don't cut it for what you actually sacrifice. 
-Do not ever expect to get a correct report- never before have experienced such a poorly run operation for a global leader.
-Poor financial controls although so much focus is on this there is little or no idea what is going on in the business.
-Living in the stone ages with technology. 
-No clear KPI's everyone has their own agenda.
-You will do things 100 times over without having clear direction on what was actually required to begin with.
-No training or education at all for employees.
-Bullying style of management.
-No team culture very divided
Advice: Read the above & listen to the feedback in the industry- this says it all.
Pros: Products are great this is the only key feature of this company

Cons: A lot of working hours +50/week. Everyone is from the same generation and no real experienced people around to look up for. No real over your career as they have a path for you and even if you may voice a certain interest in a certain position they will not grant it to you if they have another idea for you. THERE IS NO FAIRNESS IN HOW POSITION ARE GRANTED.
Advice: The arrogance of L'Oréal HR on how they take control of someone's career or think what is best for you needs to change if they want to keep good people with competencies. They have to be more transparent and more fair in the way they give promotions. They need to have a more representative mix of people, not only young, but more experienced people.
Pros: You gain a lot of experience in a very short period of time. Collegues are young, fun and have a great positive energy. There are a lot of opportunities always available within the comapnies.

Cons: You cannot go half way. You have to be strongly involved and work enough to succeed. 
Do not wait for People to tell you what to do. You would be disappoint. Be daring and make proposals. Take risks. 
Be ready to get feedbacks positive & negative & learn from them. 
There is a constant quest for Excellence that means you have to be ready to always learn & train, to do projects, undo them, to redo them better.
Advice: Great New Behaviors Project started in 2016 for even more Team Collaboration, Trust & Empowerment. Keep going !
Pros: The Pleasure to work with Talented & Passionate Colleagues in Diverse Teams .
The Chance to Always Grow thanks to strong investments in trainings like the 5stars Digital Upskilling. 
The Opportunity to have an Impact, to be an intra-preneur and lead change from day one whatever your position or age. 
The Possibility to have a well balanced and fulfilling Family Life and to contribute to a better world through meaningful Projects ( Sustainability & Social ).

Cons: The workload is horrendous. Doing extra hours is an expectation in London but the volume of work meant a poor work-life balance. Don't expect to be promoted to higher management unless you are or at least speak French - of the 6 senior management roles in my division only 1 of them was not French. Management skills need a leave a lot to be desired - the structure is incredibly hierarchical which is not to the best effect. Finally be prepared for politics - it's not always what you know or who you know but how loudly you can shout above the crowd.
Advice: Please think about bringing some additional people into the team to allow room to breathe, think and develop. Reconsider your secondary management. Realise that people should always come first and results will follow naturally.
Pros: There is oodles of opportunity to take on a project and go above and beyond. My peers were lovely across many different functions and there was a general vibe to do well and succeed. It's an ever changing, competitive environment that can really suit some people and the pace is fast - challenging projects can often be expected to be delivered within limited time frames. Also, the products are great with big discounts.

Cons: - Terrible top management. 
No guidance or assistance when you need help. But if things would go bad, you are to blame   Example: Especially in the first few months in your first job ever, you should be able to ask some questions as you are like an alien. In my case, it wasn't allowed to ask "how" questions. You could only suggest a possible set of solutions to your manager and he would choose the direction for you. How you are supposed to get to those options is a mystery. You can ask around of course but nobody would have time for you. 

-Tough, unwelcoming culture. 
Feedbacks are not constructive. If you lack a certain attribute, they'd rather change you than invest in you.
Everybody is focused on their own success. No team spirit. At least it was so in my case. A lot of people feel like outsiders.

- Long working hours
Was never a problem for me but for a lot of people I can imagine that it could be.
Advice: You really need a bit more empathy... Please investigate why the turnover rate is so high and burn out are so common.
Pros: - Great brands
- Lots of early responsibility
- Quick career advancement

Cons: Key aspects of projects can change on the last minute (but in a way is a Pro as well). There are no / very less systems/ policies/ procedures. Proud to claim 'have resisted systems for the last 100 years, and will continue to resist for another 100'. (again a Pro for some). The company is very very European (infact French), hence not very frank an open. Everything is a closely guarded secret with formalities (almost royal treatment) reserved for higher management. Company culture is a bit laid back, with tolerance for poor performance (in other words less accountability). renumerations/ benefits are more bargain based rather than being systematic or performance based.
Advice: Keep more detailed focus on country managements. More accountability will result in fixing things properly and permanenetly. as a company, we never learn from mistakes in other countries
Pros: Higher independncy in taking decisions. Faster decisions making (due to lesser dependence on systems/procedures/policies). Higher tolerance for mistakes (hence allows to try and be more creative/ bold). Higher speed of initiatives hence the flexibility.

Cons: - Middle management is a bit weak, most people seem to be promoted based on duration in the company
- Lack of empathy from management and HR 
- Salary in operations is not on par with other FMCG companies
- Long hours and weak IT systems. A lot of administrative work that may not exist in other companies due to the weak systems
- High turnover rates, which leads to the same problems and issues arising every year. Job gets repetitive after a while
Advice: Need to listen more to people on the ground and not disregard their advise and opinions.
Pros: - Employees generally treat each other with respect. You will make lifelong friends here. Culture is quite fun if you can fit in
- Opportunity to work overseas through expatriate/ mobility programs
- Development opportunities, although you need to perform well in your role to access these opportunities. If you are average/ below average, opportunities are limited
- Company is committed to ethics and sustainability
- Fringe benefits like free products and staff price

Cons: Very partioned work flow, I find I need to deal with numerous departments and people to accomplish one simple goal. I would prefer information a bit more linear and accessible without going thru so many channels.
Advice: Consolidate information databases, make a one stop for broader range of information.
Pros: Management is very flexible and respective of personal committments. I find that the work experience is satisfactory and a certain level balance is present. No one carries more of a load than others. I do enjoy numerous perks such as affiliations with other companies like Apple, NYSC, Verizon and so forth. The perks extend to the products themselves, I find that I am able to stock up on great products for the entire family without spending a dime most instances. From a Finacial persepective, I am looking forward to the consolidation of Accounting and Finance in the new building next year. This should encourage more interaction between these two important job functions.

Cons: - Work-life balance is a serious issue (great for those who strive for career and put their ambition above everything);
- Company needs to train more their leadership (inexperience): sometimes the intern experience is decided on who your leader is.
- Sometimes the experience can be too intense (importance of tasks vs. workload)
Advice: The Management/Leadership needs to be trained to do a better job at managing their interns/team.
Pros: - Very challenging experience, I wouldn't find an internship with such a great amount of responsabilities and projects anywhere else (in Portugal);
- Engaged employees who "breathe" L'Oreal;
- A company where relationships matter: in a few months I knew the company from one end to the other (around 200 employees in the office);
- The business and sector is very dynamic: Human Resources is highly strategic, instead of administrative.

Cons: - No babysit culture (applicable to new hires) - may serve as a challenge for new hires who prefers to work alone with minimum interaction as you need to take initiative in reaching out to your buddies/ mentors/ internal stakeholders 
- Not the top payer in FMCG
Advice: Please look into improving dated benefits for local markets and key functions
Pros: - Results driven company, therefore high pressure and fast paced culture, which equates to having colleagues who are direct and straight forward but not unreasonable; they are actually helpful if you take the 1st step to approach and ask questions
- A company that actually works WITH you on your career development, and offers internal mobility (disclaimer: for good/ top performers that genuinely delivers at work!)
- Flat hierarchy 
- Genuinely encourages "speak up" culture, values voices and opinions of talents regardless of seniority

Cons: the workload is very high and you usually work till night.the environment and the culture are not the best. competing so much takes also the worst out of people. plus, it's a french company, so huge hierarchy and higher mgmt don't make you feel valuable sometimes.  it's ok for an internship, but i don't know if i would like to spend some years there
Advice: it is necessary to take more care of employees and their needs. more attention to the balance of life and work.
Pros: Very challenging environment, people always compete and that takes out of them their best sometime. Constant feedbacks. Very well structured internship with a mid-intership and a final internship projects. very nice offices, lunch included.  i learnt really really a lot during this experience (my first one), and i have in general a good memory of that, even though there were some flaws

Cons: The IT systems could be better and more cutting edge, but they are working on it and I have seen positive movement to address these issues.
Advice: To continue this great initiative of Beauty for all focusing on sustainable growth both environmentally and socially. Also to continue to inspire a culture of innovation and applauding well calculated risks.
Pros: I have worked for L'Oreal for 7 years and really love it.  I have now lived in 3 countries with L'Oreal and have had an exciting and challenging career path.  I work every day with incredibly intellectually curious people great attitudes that enables us create, innovate and build things every day.  Even though it is a large organization, you still feel the entrepreneurial spirit no matter which function you are in.  The company is also extremely financially stable.

Cons: very low compensation level and other benefits comparing to the market, no opportunities to grow for the locals (the talented ones are squeezed out but the expacts whose knowledge and willingness to share experience and learn new is almost next to nothing) , very high expat level (ca.15%) while the other market rivals have 3-5 expats only. office space is [dis]organized in not ergonomic way and on top of all above - infamous French arrogance
Advice: invest more in your employees, the brands value is nothing in the country where they're not so known to the consumers but employees who are satisfied with their professional aspirations and adequate compensation can make miracles. and higher the most brilliant ones (not the cheapest ones as now!)
Pros: the BEST place to start for the recent graduates (or even last year students) but those experienced ones - look somewhere else

Cons: Management has lost it way 
AVP's and above can't be bothered with people below
No mentoring or succession plans
Not enough people to do the job( do more with less has hit its limit )
Do as I say , not as I do
Very very weak raises
Management is hypocritical in what they preach
You're never good enough
Too many young and inexperienced people
Blaming
Good money and perks don't come until you are an AVP, good luck getting there
Many non inspirational and weak "leaders"
Advice: Stop trying to save a couple of bucks by not hiring enough people to do the work.  We are exhausted!  Hire the people and see how easily and quickly we get the next billion customers.
Pros: The challenge of success pushes you to the edge and really make you think beyond your limits.
International opportunities 
Worldwide networking
Lots of brands
Structure and procedures
Smart people
I have an office ;-)

Cons: The company lack of process can drive anyone crazy. Even if you like to work that way. People tend not to give the proper tools to start working. It's like someone give you a Ferrari without you having a driver license. You have to learn how to drive in the middle of a highway. The company it's completely moved by international visits. If L'oréal CEO or even any Regional Manager comes to your country, get ready for action. Lots of money spent on trying to make a good impression for the top management. The company is completely brand-centric.
Advice: Become more consumer-centric, and less brand-centric. L'oréal and it's brands shoudn't try to impose consumers what to use or like.
Pros: Really dynamic. Everything can change in a few meetings. The company gives you great independence to propose different strategies and solutions. For those with strong heart and great reselience.

Cons: Certain brands can be very hierarchical, lack of work life balance, all bad jobs just get given to 'the intern', not very welcomed into the team. Work isn't appreciated only negative feedback given. Grad scheme is so hard to obtain and for a very specific type of person, making a lot of the successful people the same type. I would have had a much better experience if I was in a different brand and don't blame L’Oreal, but have a negative view on the brand and its General Manager.
Advice: Look into certain brands closer so you can see how the GM's in some brands aren't good leaders and their negative values and outlook feeds down into the company.
Pros: Good staff benefits of staff shop and friends and family sale and get to be a part of exciting opportunities

Cons: International Mobility: A big con is that it does not allow for easy international mobility. Hence, if you want to move out, no matter how much you love the company, you will have to switch jobs
Internal Movement: You will have to wait in the current role for 18 months, before you can even apply to another role. This is a longer time than in most other companies.
Advice: None
Pros: Extremely transparent: You can discuss anything with your boss, especially in sales. There have been multiple instances of something going wrong on field, and the first instinct is to tell the superiors, instead of covering it up
Lot of learning: Since at least in India, it is still growing, a lot of systems are being put in place now. This means that you learn the processes as they are being developed, and can even contribute to it

Cons: Top management level not trustworthy.
Strong culture - if you are not 'loreal-like', you can forget that they will try to embrace you, wherever your experience brings from prior to joining them.
Whether you are a talent or not, is not dependant on your capabilities but rather whether the management likes you.
Office has very high levels of attrition and workload is simply thrown to however is around.
Has 'high hire and fire' situation in singapore office, no work-life balance.
Staff morale is very low.
Advice: In the pursuit of short-term goals, you have lost many talents that has brought loreal to what it is today. 
Hope you can investigate and review what is really happening on the ground and turn the company around, before it becomes a place where beauty professionals shun away from joining.
Good Luck!
Pros: Singapore office has good staff benefits compared to other similar firms in the like industry. 
Internal mobility is fluid internationally - career opportunities are abundant.
Co-workers are nice and friendly, up to middle management levels.
Office is centrally located, near to subway. Amentities are nearby.

Cons: Improvement in integration in role
Credit should be given where credit is due ;)
Advice: Reward the managers who develop their teams and develop individuals (yes its about the numbers but its about people too)
Pros: L`Oreal is a place where you can learn a tremendous amount
You eat what you cook =  you work hard, you will get rewarded
The people are incredible, kind and intelligent and make coming into work a pleasure
The diversity of backgrounds create a inclusive atmosphere
The professional division is a great place to learn, strive and cooperate (my favorite division)

Cons: Level of stress on employees is enormous and for some hard to handle. Chaotic culture of constant change of mind is very deep in the company's DNA. In love with its products, and less oriented towards consumers. Definitely not a people-centric company, one does not feel appreciated by a system, but more as a very replaceable gear wheel. Promises from management very easy to be given, but hard to be implemented later.
Advice: People do matter. Don't forget you depend on Millennials and Generation Z. And both of them want to be appreciated and can tell a heavy photoshop when they see it.
Pros: Very fast-paced environment, with a relaxed and friendly corporate culture when it comes to people relations. Great for learning and developing your potential because of demanding challengesin front of you. High level of autonomy. If you have a record of good results your ideas and proposal will be highly appreciated and very possibly implemented.

Cons: Not having a dedicated office in Cape Town to support sales team, due budget constraints within local office and thus a restrictive head count in division meant added work load, facilities within the offices could have been of a higher standard and at times created an inconvenience, lack of ongoing training and skill development opportunities available to current staff to improve and expand within their role, hiring of incorrect individuals causing complications and set backs in the work processes and systems and thus a lack of accountability and frustration within teams and divisions
Advice: None
Pros: Fantastic benefits &amp; package, opportunity to travel, great incentive plans, career growth potential and opportunities, fantastic graduation programme allowing entry to company, international brand experience, exposure to diverse range of markets and brands, enjoyable work culture and ethos, involvement in and exposure to 360 degree spectrum of business functions allowed for holistic understanding of how production and business works

Cons: Competitive, long hours and week-ends, poor work/life balance, salary below market average and not in line with amount of work, too many meetings, gossipy environment, Toronto office not downtown.
Advice: Try to create an environment where you can have a better work-life balance. Making an environment where it is seen as bad to leave the office before 8 or not do any work on the week-end might be ok for people who it is their first job and want to move the corporate ladder quickly but it won't help you attract good talent from other company and it will keep you with a high turn-over rate where employees will leverage their under-paid job to a better playing employer offering better conditions.
Pros: Fun people to work with, fast track to get promotion and career advancement, opportunity to touch many different roles, well located

Cons: 1. Still an old fashion type of company in a state of the art building with billion euros profit 
2.They really need to review their HR
3.Big question mark in diversity, they need to improve their efforts in providing sufficient working condition to female employees so they can grow their career 
4.Oh yeaa politics ...
5.Stuck career movement unless u are happy with constant situation and poor package of compensation 
6.Make it clear on what you wants to HR and your leaders make sure it is well writen before you make any deal on assignment.
Advice: Your employees is your investment. Treat them at its best.
Pros: Great in reputational management but they really need to walk the talk! 
They are good in making jargons n tagline
Good perks but also quite political in the leadership team
Good in insurance coverage for family
Free products 
System already in place just like other multinational company
Commitment in the social and environmental management is clear and proven

Cons: Despite the numerous yearly evaluations done to the employees, HR does not fully nor profesionally review them before firing someone, so they keep firing good people just becuse "a Manager said so". 
In the end, you can be fired just becuse a new boss is not very found of you in a personal level, depite your many top contributions to the Company. So sad!
Advice: Establish additional control and investigation processes within HR, to ensure that your top employees are not fired for personal or false reasons.
Pros: I worked there for almost 9 years and the overall experience was awsome!!
L'Oréal is a place where you'll never get bored and where you'll be able to learn and apply as much as you want. There is a lot of freedom to work and they also offer great additional benefits such as flex-time, home-office, etc.
I loved every single moment of my time there!!

Cons: Lack of clarity over career opportunities for Graduates at the end of the program, stemming from an inability to confront the realities of the situation (too many graduates, too few operational roles). Responsibilities and amount of engaging (as opposed to menial) work varies too much from role to role on the graduate scheme, with some roles similar to operational roles and others too heavily admin based.
Advice: Re-consider the role of the graduate scheme (cheap labour or future leadership development) and adapt the balance between entry level full-time roles and graduates accordingly. More formal organisation of graduate scheme such that it is ensured all management trainees have serious responsibilities and engaging work across all roles.
Pros: Relatively good benefits. Young, energetic colleagues. Friendly, relaxed atmosphere on the whole. Relatively flexible working arrangements. High level of mobility between functions. Well-structured graduate program, with exposure to variety of roles, responsibilities and functions.

Cons: - Work work work... And very manual work...
 - Lotsa carrying, lifting, clearing because of messy storage areas!
 - Limited and pathetic storage of GWPs, Uniforms, Docs etc. Most of the time are spent in thinking how to dispose, hide or disperse them to outlets...
 - Competitive environment, more so when you're in the sales team.
 - Lotsa yellings from sales and it's considered normal. Managers shouting at staff on the phone happens everyday.
Advice: Think about why is there a higher turnover for certain brands, didn't it came across your mind that empty yelling are useless and people are more resistant to change when they're being yelled at. (for nothing and fr not understanding the reasons behind the yelling...)
Pros: - Lotsa opportunities whether you wanna move up or across the brands
 - Friendly and helpful colleagues
 - Tons of trainings and benefits available (if you're free enough to enjoy them, it's there!)

Cons: Human Resource support for expats in Tokyo office lacks professionalism, mainly in salary visibility and administrative support. The tax system is complicated and there is no tax briefing, so you will only know your net income by the end of your expatriation. In my case, a large unanticipated sum (more than 400,000 JPY) was deducted from my final pay. When I requested for clarification, it took them almost a month to reply.
Advice: Improve orientation for new expatriates and standardise the structure for expat packages around the zone. Since the tax system in Japan is more complicated, discuss the packages in NET income instead of GROSS. This will ease the unnecessary stress for expats and give much more visibility where finances are concerned.
Pros: Flexible hours, passionate and fun management, many opportunities for overseas work posting, vibrant and young working atmosphere, great staff discounts. People here are energetic and open to new ideas.

Cons: - extreme pressure
- unrealistic expectations
- little to no structure/process (very chaotic) 
- expected to work long hours and on weekends 
- management and HR are often not transparent with employees (love to promise promotions/move to international offices but always takes much longer than what is promised, or it never happens at all) 
- high turnover rate within teams
Advice: Be more transparent with employees - don't over promise and under deliver on timelines for promotions and moves to international offices
Pros: - a lot of responsibility at a young age
- if they believe you are talented they will reward you and you will get promotions very quickly
- high exposure to upper management early on in your career
- work on some of the most incredible brands in the world 
- learn from amazing, talented individuals

Cons: Very hierarchical company structure, resulting in very long decision making processes and also resulting in stressed out people since top management in Paris have no idea/don't care of the workload. Everybody is stressed out and depressed. Very bad work/life balance. Low salary. Last minute decisions and changes all the time, partly because none of the managers dare to say "NO" to Paris. Very competitive culture, also internally. A lot of responsibility but not the same amount of control over decisions - very frustrating. Very old-fashion it /reporting systmes. A lot of time spend on reporting to Paris - could have been spend on developing the business. Managers have good technical skills, but very poor people skills.
Advice: Take care of your employees - this would benefit the company as well sine the turnover rate is extremely high and a lot of knowledge is lot and money spend every time a good employee leaves/burn out.
Pros: Steap learning curve, good colleagues, nice products

Cons: Not many cons to say, not any cons to say really, I believe if i were forced into saying a con it would be that "I wish they spoke to us more on a personal bases after the brandstorm was concluded, they really do seem like very fun people to talk to".
Advice: None
Pros: Before i talk about the pros and cons its very important to state that I havent worked within the company itself or ever was an integral part of the Loreal community (on a corporate bases), however, I did spend some time working with the representatives of loreal in order to come up with our brandstorm. PROS: Amazing people, they give you a sense of an unbelievably fun and dynamic environment, highly intelligent they really do know what theyre doing. Ended up second Place.

Cons: Work life balance does not exist
Senior Management has their own agenda for you, it doesn't matter what YOU want
The pay is TERRIBLE
Very competitive. stressful environment... backstabbing people
Advice: Stop treating your talented, high potential people badly or they won't leave to go work someplace else. Maybe you should consider what is best for them sometimes and NOT about your own agenda all the time. These are people and they want to be happy at their jobs.
Pros: Great Experience in that I learned a great deal while I was there. Great preparation for going to another company, because if you can make it a few years at L'Oreal, you can make it ANYWHERE! Everything else is a breeze after you spend a few years there
Benefite were good and good perks (product, etc..)

Cons: Super Long working hours and operational messes that you are continuously clearing. It can get very tiring
Advice: The focus is always on the marketing side. Need to focus on other functions and empower them to build a more balanced work place
Pros: It's an open culture with a flat hierarchy. The company is very agile you are allowed to trial New things and even if it fails the Managment supports you and gives you a feedback. There are no fixed processes hence you can bring about any kind of change. If you are an asset and a performer you are exposed to the TOP leadership. Also they tend to load everything to the person who does most the work that to me was an opportunity to learn so much

Cons: Above everything else, L'Oreal is exceptional at sales - selling the product to customers, selling "opportunities" to new employees, and especially selling a certain type of delusion to everyone who works there.

Here are the main difficulties I faced while working at L'Oreal:

-3 out of 5 senior and mid-level managers are generally unequipped for the role

This means a lack of understanding of what it means to manage in a professional sense (setting objectives, defining role scope and responsibility, removing roadblocks, etc), but what's more concerning, is that a lot of management is unequipped for the role emotionally - with no ability to empathize or understand the needs of the subordinates, they are followed only because the employees have to follow them.

-Ego + Politics &gt; Merit + Results

I vividly recall my manager obsessing over the most insignificant details on a powerpoint deck, only to ensure that when he or she presents it to upper management, she is seen as a "superstar". I also recall manipulating the data to make a failed launch look "good", just so my manager could have good news to share. There is a general preference for ignoring data-driven decisions in favour of whatever makes the manager in question look good.

-Emotional abuse

It is a regular occurrence to see co-workers cry. It's even more commonplace to have a vacant role on any given team because the employee is on "sick leave" aka "stress-leave" aka "burn-out". The scary part is that no one is bothered by either of the above because they happen so frequently. 

-Hardcore cool-aid culture

There is a strong expectation that everyone who works at L'Oreal must absolutely love it all the time, never mention anything negative, and ALWAYS show intentions of staying at the company until retirement. If you as much as mention that you might have an interest in perhaps exploring another industry or company way down the line, you will be told to keep quiet as it will damage your career progression. The ironic part is that L'Oreal Canada has by far the highest turnover rate in the industry, and forcing employees to always pretend to be "loving the experience" only makes it more difficult to get to the root cause of the problems.

-Lack of ethical backbone

I can't disclose any details relating to product development for legal reasons, but there are a lot of very questionable products both from an efficacy stand-point as well as from the consumer positioning standpoint.
Advice: Without sounding like a broken record - please take off your L'Oreal-tinted glasses and assess the state of the company objectively. The issues I mentioned have been voiced hundreds of times over the years and no one has done anything about it. You know what the problems are, you just need to choose to resolve them.
Pros: The positives include:

-Lots of free and discounted product
-Young/fun co-workers
-Nice office following the most recent round of renovations
-Good mentorship available if you seek it out

Cons: Senior Management visits from Paris are a unhelpful.  Senior Managers from Paris can be aggressive and quite the divas but this is also changing.

The office is quite crammed and old.  It is not representative of a glamorous beauty company.

Not many British senior managers.
Advice: Continue the change you started.  You are doing a brilliant job.  Please invest in the office.
Pros: Fast paced, early responsibility, very entrepreneurial for a big company.  Best portfolio of brands in the industry.

Inspiring leadership. UK MD comes from a different company and is very approachable.  He is really transforming the company into a modern business.  

Despite the intensity of the job, the new Work Smart program allows a lot of flexibility to balance work and life

Cons: There can be a bit of an old school management style in certain pockets, but they're putting huge amounts of effort into changing this
Advice: In the context of change and improvement, don't lose the essence of what makes us L'Oréal!
Pros: If you want space to move, autonomy, freedom and big learning opportunities then L'Oréal is the place for you. You genuinely get out what you put in. It's fast-paced and high-energy and you're surrounded by highly intelligent and inspiring people to help you make it happen. Every year at L'Oréal feels like five years of learning that you'd get elsewhere. The learning & development is world class too, with an array of apps, MOOCs and more to keep you at the cutting edge.

Cons: Work life balance can lead to some problems in the long run - but I've found this at other companies as well.  They demand excellence but if you cant run fast enough, you're in trouble.
Advice: Seems as if HR plays a large role in the way that people are promoted.  If you don't know how to play the game, then you can be left behind.  Might be something to watch.
Pros: L'Oreal Canada is among the best I've seen or worked at.  Complete autonomy on the job, great training, practical experience, and one hell of a team to work with.  Compensation is great and they give you all the room in the world to run.  Phenomenal company.

Cons: You need to be on your game all the time, and the pace of action is very fast.
People change jobs very frequently so you're always building new relationships which, whilst stimulating, can slow down progress.
French culture takes time to understand. 
The london office is very tired and needs updating. The executive offices are beautiful, reflecting the brands. Everyone else works in cramped spaces at ugly desks.
Advice: There are too many priorities. Focus more.
Pros: The pay & benefits are slightly above average, not the best, but good. You get rewarded for achievement.
The business is so varied that you can have a whole lifetime career with L'Oreal and never get bored.
It's a fast-moving, entrepreneurial culture with empowerment for anyone who wants to take it.

Cons: the benefits take many time to be with you since their hire you. 
The day I stared working with them was august 3th and today still waiting for the gas for my car and the vales for supermarket. Also for the parking lot, my refunds and some other things that I have to use to complete my work in the way they told me that will occur it is not happening.
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of information, friendly website with useful tools and programs. 
They try to help you personal and professional career with courses and programs but they don't teach you how to use them or how to access to them and it is not always easy.
It's a multicultural company so you can see diferent people and work with diferent cultures.

Cons: Could be very cut-throat and challenging in certain departments.  Very high expectations, especially in marketing, product development and production management, resulting in high turnover in those areas.
Advice: Redistribute the work load from the departments with a high turnover, as some departments are significantly more difficult to work in, more hours, etc, while in other departments in the same building it could be pretty relaxed.  I know, because I worked on both sides.
Pros: Great benefits, including unheard of 13 paid holidays!
Many promotions from within, especially to manager and director levels.  Also, lots of opportunities to move around in the company to various roles and departments. 
Product discounts - about 50% off for everything made by the company, plus monthly free goods allotment

Cons: Total lack of respect from management: from day one I was told I could never expect to grow up in my career, that I would be stuck in the Assistant role no matter what my performance is. No surprise since in Portugal it is more of "who you know" that matters rather than you being a good professional. I was treated like a maid many times and had to use the word "doctor" before their names like they're some kind of special people. Once I gave a suggestion and the marketing director responded for me to go to away and not give suggestions. No training or support is given, they expect for you to know everything just because. I was happy to get away from this place and I don't recommend the Marketing department at Lóreal in Portugal to no one, unless of course you're one of "who you know" team.
Advice: Learn how to manage people.
Pros: The possibility to bring products for free and the name on the CV.

Cons: - No work-life balance
- A lot of stress, very fast changing of situations, L'Oréal chaos 
- You have to be be fluent French to get to management positions
- Most of the time you aŕe rather a Firefighter than a Financial Controller
- Lower salaries than the competition
- Also incompetent employees can reach responsible positions only by waiting long enough
Advice: None
Pros: - Lot's of experience - As an intern/trainee you can advance very fast to responsible assignments that are done by Senior middle-management in other companies
- Fast career advance
- No boundaries and lot's of opportunities to try out different fields - it is no problem to go from Finance to Purchasing/Procurement and vice versa, however moving from Finance to Marketing, although possible, is not so often to be seen
- Very dynamic

Cons: Working environment in L'Oreal is quite political. I will say much more than other companies in cosumer industry.
The number of women are much more than men. In general, it is not desirable to work with so many women around.
L'Oreal likes to recruit people from high education background in prestigious universities.
Advice: Please do not think that people graduating from prestious universities means that they are great entrepreneurs in business. 
Itis not effective to have so many meetings...
Pros: If you have passion to work at the cosmetic industry and you are ambitious, L'Oreal is quite nice place to work.
L'Oreal give good chances to develp the ability of each emplyoee if you are intelligent.
For example, you can get promoted in a fast-track comparing with other companies.
In addition, you can have many opportunities to work overseas as an expat.

Cons: Very difficult to move forward if you are not "connected" politically
Criteria for promotions not well defined.
If you're not in the management trainee program, you will have trouble moving ahead.
Advice: The company does not do a good job of describing the criteria necessary to move forward.  For example, after 3 consecutive "Exceeds Expectation" reviews, I was still left in the same position as when I started.  Persons I started work with in the management trainee (Tracker) program, who had the same career path and lesser performance reviews, have received promotions and I have not.  There are more people working for the company than those!
Pros: Ability to quickly gain a lot of experience in different areas.
Management does not micro-manage
Good work-life balance.
Very competitive benefit package.

Cons: owever, it is still important to know what the current salary range is for the profession. Find salary surveys at the library or on the Internet, and check the classifieds to see what comparable jobs in your area are paying. This information can help you negotiate compensation once the employer makes an offer.
Advice: Use this as a chance to summarize your good characteristics and attributes and how they may be used to benefit the organization
Pros: What salary are you expecting? You probably don't want to answer this one directly. Instead, deflect the question back to the interviewer by saying something like: "I don't know. What are you planning on paying the best candidate?" Let the employer make the first offer.

Cons: There is always room for improvement.
Advice: Keep giving feedback to your employees. Transparency is always best!
Pros: Always keep raising the bar and reinvent! L'Oreal employees have access to on-line doctor. You just sign in register, then you speak to a nurse you can be given an apt within the same day or are connected right away. The doctor acctualy takes time to discuss with you .  Then does his diagnosis and sends the perscritpion your your pharmacy! I mean I did this twice at the comfort of my home saved my so much TIME and worry! My pediatrician was only avialble 3 days afterwards. I can't say enough about this service. Thank you L'Oreal now that makes my life so much easier!!!!!!!

Cons: Culture managed by fear.  Threatening to fire people constantly...upper management is mostly made up of misogynist men with a few women on complete power trips.   While i worked there, my husband was diagnosed with cancer and no one even ever bothered to ask how i was doing for an entire year.  When I left, they tried to retain me with a counter offer.  My answer was: I don’t know what life holds for me....all I know is that I do want kids, and that my parents will most likely pass in the next few years, things will happen....I dont know what,  I only know one thing for sure, I don’t want to be here when it all happens.  ✌🏻
Advice: Care more about your people and it will come right back at you.
Pros: You can find some of the  most brilliant people here.  You can learn so much from a bunch of extremely smart people

Cons: Too long working hours with no OT pay
Irrational senior management who onky knows to push but no help
Only product focus-limited creativity in marketing
No idea about digital world, think onky to put official content on Internet is enough
Politics and only French or French-lovers can be promoted 
Pyramid effect-top and muddle management don't move so the junior managers keep leaving
Advice: Teach senior managers to control their temper before sending them out to push subsidiaries 
Offer more promotion opportunities or else ppl will keep leaving 
If you cancel profit sharing kits of ppl will leave 
Allow more creative matket and celebrity endorsement is not the only solution
HR is useless
Pros: International exposure 
High quality standard
Early responsibility
World profit sharing

Cons: Management bullying does exist , and HR do not help you .... They bully you into not taking it to tribunal....managers get promoted who have complaints for bullying team 
Favouritism encouraged 
5-6 hrs driving on top of your 8 hr day is allowed by HR
Meetings last for hr...8am start 7pm finish , even though there is a L'Oreal meeting charter up on the walls 
If you have over 8 yrs service they try to get you out rather than pay the salary , trying to go down the capability route , watch out !
Advice: HR need to listen to the team members about management bullying it does go on and needs to be addressed
Pros: Staff shop
Great to have on your cv

Cons: - undervalued
- treated very differently to full time staff (treated as a contractor)
- expected to give ideas and pressured to do all the work but then not recognised when pulled off, praise is given to managers which can be demotivating
- very limited progression to graduate scheme with lots of pressure to do way over and above job role which is already a vast work load
- little support from HR as they are busy recruiting next interns
Advice: None
Pros: - real responsibility from day 1
- big project/brand involvement
- exposure to senior staff
- good hands-on experience for when moving onto other companies
- name looks good on CV

Cons: The organization is so complex that sometimes it is difficult to make things move
No process and no methodology
The salary in France is based on a package with a fix salary and a very important "intéressement+participation" (3 to 4 months of salary per year free of charges). The problem is that the fix is in general lower than in other companies.
Advice: Please take decisions and defend them
Pros: You build your own carrier at L'Oréal
There are still new fields to explore
This is a challenging world that can build a person and his carrier
There are a lot of business represented and with some bridges if you have talents.

Cons: Concentrated in Hair and Makeup categories. High competition among its own brands with lower margins
Advice: Improve by differentiating and separating innovation paths between brands (L'Oreal / Garnier / Maybelline). Minimize internal competition and avoid hurting financial margins. Define real blockbusters... Bigger, Fewer, Faster, Better (all new product seems to have same priority). Execution at the POS has lot of room for improvement. Increase beauty authority and presence at other personal care categories... e.g. Skin Care (Face & Body Lotions), Deodorants, Shower products, Femenine protection. Employees rotation between countries and brands is too high and fast... These creates no expertise.
Pros: Brand, Beauty authority, Innovation, Advertising

Cons: Change of management thus many changes and affected the morale of employees
Lack of strong middle management leadership
Expected employees to take on a lot of responsibilities which can be a stretch
Advice: Appreciate employees more especially those back-end or contract employees, not just those profit generating divisions
Pros: I have been working in L'Oreal Singapore for 5 years.
Working environment is fun and people are great to work with!
Definitely not a gossipy environment as some claimed.
Career Development is there if you ask for it
Will listen to employees' opinions and improved welfare to enhance work-life balance

Cons: This is a French company that operates as the French do.  It's very political, and hierarchical, and you do have to learn the politics to get ahead.  They always say you have to manage your own career at L'Oreal, and it's true.  You have to know what you want and learn exactly the right way to push, and who to become friends with - not everything is merit based.  And god forbid you ever show a bit of emotion - the masculine culture of L'Oreal manufacturing may come as a bit of a surprise, considering it's a cosmetics company.  There are no women past a certain level, so be aware that you can move forward quickly at the beginning, but you will probably have to get out after 6-7 years if you really want to move ahead.

The downside of quick responsibility is that they give you little-to-no training - it's all "on the job" training, but this is the L'Oreal way, and we have all come to accept it, even if we don't like it.

Finally, the "leadership" abilities of much of the management leaves much to be desired.  The top guys are between good and great, but there are a lot of people under them who don't really know how to manage... and I don't think L'Oreal has done a good job in correcting that yet.
Advice: Worry about the fact that even though L'Oreal was voted one of the top spots to start a career, it is consistantly not ranked above the top companies to work for.  Young people are willing to work hard and produce really good work, but when they see their peers, or their predecessors doing the same and still not getting rewarded just because they don't play the game exactly right, this is a problem.  At some point "experience" does not count as a part of compensation.  Finally, you hire smart people, but you don't trust them to do smart things.
Pros: Young, dynamic co-workers make it easy to have a social life, especially if you've moved from elsewhere.  There's something special about working for a company whose products you see on the shelf at the salon or in Target or even the make-up counter at Macy's.  They do give you a lot of responsability right off the bat, and if you continue to perform, you can move ahead, as long as you learn your way through the politics.  Finally, as long as you're performing well (average, even), your job is not at stake - L'Oreal holds onto its employees sometimes well after their expiration date, but this also gives you the chance to make mistakes and take risks without ruining your future.  If you don't fit in one position, they will try you out in another, because when they hired you, somewhere they saw a spark of something that they want to see shine.

Cons: - Very bureaucratic environment
- Poor management significantly impacts team morale
- Lack of upward mobility if you are unwilling to move to Montreal
- Communication between head office and field team is problematic; feedback from field teams is rarely leads to improvements in strategy
- They don't invest in the professional development of their employees
Advice: - Listen to your sales reps given that you emphasize the importance of gathering market intelligence that is communicated to head office
- Value your employees and take reasonable sources of job dissatisfaction as opportunities to improve your organization and reduce turnover
Pros: - Significant level of autonomy
- Flexible schedule
- Plenty of opportunities to be entrepreneurial in your territory

Cons: All about networking far more than performance, very competitive. Young leadership that needs to be shapped. Poor HR management with lack of undertsanding what leadership trully means (despite the country)
Advice: Please HR, be caring to your employees. Understand who your public is and enable them for what they can acutally become. Do not hinder people's growth due to your frustrations. Leaders...be mature before you aim to grow in your career, your knowhow and expertise has to match your emotional maturity, after all your first product is the peple you work with!
Pros: You will be very autonomy to create new procedure, millenials workstyle, awesome brands to work with

Cons: -Sad to see new talented wasted

-Never seen a company with such a high turnover EVER

-No one is really good at what they are doing because they are only in a position for a year or two (by choice, or not by choice)

-Better "play the game right" or be played --Seen too many employees leave because they just couldn't take it
Advice: Realize that new talent hired has more potential than the position given to them...

It is up to management to test their limits & set them up for failure or success.
Pros: -Energy
-Fresh Ideas (because of high turnover)
-Lots of position movement
-Lots of innovation
-Compensation
-Benefits
-Some AMAZING co-workers

Cons: The inequalities between the different divisions are alot. Office staff eat on glass and overall normal plates while factory staff eat on metal plates.
 Employees working on Loreal consumer products division have extremely high benefits compared to staff working on local products(which ironically sell more).
Extremely low salaries for interns, management trainees and those on contract.
Slow decision making.
Frequent resignations.
Few career growth opportunities for locals.
Advice: You have to make things more equal in Kenya. For the company to grow, discrimmination has to stop.
Make everyone feel as if the role they play in the company is valued.
Get more locals in high up positions as they understand East Africa more, especially in sales and marketing.
Pros: No dress code.
Open door policy.

Cons: Since there are some many interlocutors and speakers, it sometimes becomes hard to be quick and flexible to launch campaigns to the market. Also, it's a highly competitive environment with lots of business-related pressure, and it becomes quite hard to keep a work/life balance.
Advice: Need to simplify work processes: less meetings, more concese feedback, more analysis of results
Pros: Your managers trust you from the very first moment you start working at the company. You are entitled and responsible for your position and can easily get visibility to top management levels. It's easy to learn from cross-functional teams and, if you perform correctly, you are given the chance to grow in the company.

Cons: Unsustainable workload (particularly in the marketing brand teams) with extremely stretched thin resource. Especially during the beauty “bounce back” after Covid-19. This leads to frustration, low team morale, regular burn-out and always feeling like you are firefighting rather than getting ahead.
Advice: The only way to improve colleague stress is to reduce workload and increase headcount. It’s nice to have wellness programmes but ultimately the only way to shift the dial is to change those two things above.
Pros: Fantastic, inspiring work colleagues
Forward thinking ways of working (though not 100% there yet)
Fun social perks
Great employee benefits 
Free products
Sense of pride and admiration for working for an amazing beauty company. A family team feel.

Cons: Decisions must always go up the entire chain of command before any action can be taken.
Superiors do not groom their subordinates for advancement.
Too many employees who have done the same job for many years. Leaves a lack of passion and open-mindedness to new procedures or ways of accomplishing tasks.
Advice: Work on allowing growth and experimentation within the ranks of middle management. Develop a sense of partnership within the company. The lack of upward mobility in various areas of the company prevents upper management from grooming their direct reports for higher level work.
Pros: Well respected brands.
High regard for quality.
Solid portfolio of brands and products. Well diversified across various price points.
Forward-thinking in some of the benefits offered.

Cons: Be ready to work way more than 40hr/week.
You're just a number and they remind you every day that you can easily be replace.
Judgmental environment, people backstab each others and trash talk to get promoted
High % of depression, burn out, etc.
Advice: If someone leaves on a burn out, don't give his or her job to someone else who'se alrwady working more than 60hr per week. This person will eventually leave on a burn out too. Just hire someone on a contract to help out you employees.
Pros: Good salary and incentives
Possibility to advance within the company
Prestige of the brand
Glamorous environment

Cons: Absolutely no work life balance. You can never work too hard
Lack of leadership
Turnover is like no other place
Too many meetings. Nothing can move forward without a series of meeting
Decision making is a huge issue
Lack of creativity and innovation
Upper Management is fully disconnected from employees, even at high levels
Many employees are unprepared for the positions they hold
One year non-competition agreement is unrealistic
Very few employees over the age of 45 
Recruitment is problematic; it takes months to replace vacant positions
Advice: This is where the problem is. Management is leading by force with little to no understanding of what is truly happening within the company. Moral is at the lowest in years and employees are resigning left and right. Recruiting new employees is difficult; a lot of people refuse to join due to the company's reputation and the new non-competition agreement.
Pros: Excellent benefits
Good portfolio of mass brands
Offices are pleasant, well located

Cons: Very cut throat, competitive environment. It wasn't as big of a deal in my position, but for account managers sales meetings are a nightmare. You can expect to get called out and quizzed on your numbers. Very poor work/life balance

Few opportunities outside of NY/NJ

Attitude by management. Former President of our division was a total diva. Top management of L'Oreal USA is also always brought in from France.
Advice: Lose the attitude, create a more team oriented environment.
Pros: Amazing benefits - company car, 3 weeks vacation, free and discounted product, worked from home (for field teams), summer hours (for corporate office)

Lots of learning and training opportunities. Generally nice and supportive people.

Cons: Unachievable sales goals, management not respectful of your days off, they expect you to take the calls even though they are off on weekends and are unavailable to take calls. Not alot of ability to move up or progress in your career unless you work in the head office in Montreal. They keep giving the upper management more work instead of promoting employees. Some managers have 3 or 4 job titles.
Advice: Please give credit where credit is due. Give part time workers benefits and show appreciation for the employees who are working for you
Pros: 4 weeks of vacation, global profit sharing, stock options, bonus pay, heath benefits and comprehensive care and share program. Workplace stability.

Cons: Extremely cliquey culture depending which division you work in - much worse in some teams than others. Lots of contractors who have zero protection or benefits even after working for L’Oréal for 5-6 years, due to “lack of headcount” - a very unethical practise in my opinion which affected many people during COVID.
Advice: None
Pros: Great team ethos if you work in the right kind of department. Potential to grow and move into various roles if you have a good manager dedicated to your career progression. L’Oréal run many events throughout the year catering to awareness of different topics, and they are relatively good at taking employee feedback on board.

Cons: Does not always reward merit or loyalty
Weak Talent Management Or career progression processes 
Very very few opportunities to move to roles outside the country below Senior Leadership levels
Not the best pay-master in the industry
Not the best ecosystem to learn commercial processes as not a deep-distributed organization.
No processes to ensure parity or balance between grades basis job profile or experience. Majorly manually driven and Subjective on this front.
Advice: None
Pros: Strong Marketing Ecosystem
Very Strong brands with global pedigree
Smaller organisation and hence tighter knit
Very strong focus on Ethics and Diversity
Not very rigid so easier to implement ideas or take decisions
Very good learning opportunity on top-of-pyramid channels like Modern Trade and Ecommerce

Cons: 1) No regard for work-life balance
2) Usually under-pay compared to competition
3) Compensation levels not consistent for the same role. Discrimination very common in compensation levels
4) Management attitude not to the standard of a global MNC
Advice: 1) Have a clear definition of what will be earned upon reaching a certain role. Lack of consistency in pay for those taking up a new role impacts motivation.
2) Facilitate work-life balance. 
3) Invest in "human". You call the company a "people-first" company.
4) Investment in tech development should not come at the cost of investment in people.
Pros: 1) Company invests in learning
2) Good co-workers (pre-pandemic)
3) Opportunity for growth
4) Immense learning opportunities
5) One of the biggest companies in the world

Cons: - Relatively poor work life balance with long hours often continuing into the night. 
- Can be very 'political' at times with many decisions being made due to 'the boss wants it this way'
- Pay is 'competitive', but not better than other companies offering similar roles 
- Management are slow to implement the deep changes necessary to secure and retain young talent.
Advice: Implement financial incentives and penalties for management based on teams feedback, to ensure change is adopted faster across the organisation.
Pros: - Invests in training for staff across multiple disciplines
- Chance to own your projects 
- Passionate colleagues
- Good career opportunities for top talent to move overseas with the company

Cons: Too much politics slow down processes and initiatives. Such a big and successful company, that´s often ends up being too conservative, and not that innovative.  Salary not that competitive. 12 hours shifts very often.
Advice: As said
Pros: The Beauty business is inspiring, fascinating and challenging. Working as a Brand development manager on start up brands at L'Oreal, offers a rich experience on many different fields: From Marketing, to Education, PR, Digital and sales, experiencing both the Selective and the Professional medical channel. Dealing with different business models form a perfumery open sales one to the department store, from a  free standing store retail  business to the launch of your own e-commerce. Finally relationships with colleagues is an additional  reason to keep standing the cons.

Cons: You have to work under fast pace environment and sometimes you might be stressed if you could not manage the timeline of your tasks well. Many people are working until very late to catch up with tight deadlines.
Advice: Everyone in the company is super busy especially the management team. You may not be able to get timely feedback and evaluation from the management team.
Pros: L'Oréal is the world leading skin care & cosmetics company and you will be able to observe the operation of this big multi-national company. You could understand how a beauty brand works under cooperation of marketing & sales team. And more importantly, you could learn time management, multi-tasking and practical analytical skills. Good experience.

Cons: - The worst leadership team with unclear direction. They are aggressive and far from inspiring. 
- Toxic culture. Hilarious that rather than change the culture they just deny it and cover up the faults with dedicated weeks for D&amp;I, leadership etc. Yet they don't implement these core principles. 
- Motivation is based on fear rather than ambition. You can feel the tension in meetings. 
- Hierarchal and political. Be prepared to play the game. 
- Disrespectful and nasty employees
- Unforgiving and do not allow for mistakes
- Managers are clueless about managing. They need to be trained to support
- Thankless job
- There's always someone looking to throw you under a bus
- Bullying culture
- It's not about quality,  It's about making things look pretty and getting ahead
Advice: None
Pros: Find the amazing people who aren't 'L'Oréal' types. There are few, but hold on to them when you find them! They keep you sane. 

-

Cons: No transparency between management and lower levels and work life balance is non-existent if you want to move up the corporate ladder quickly.
Advice: If you want to retain your top talent encourage work life balance and walk the walk.  Don't ask for the sky all the time as you will burn your employees as they are the most dynamic and talented teams I have ever worked with.
Pros: If you are motivated, smart and creative you will move up fast within the company learning very quickly and gaining responsibility just as quickly.  Great place to begin you career.  Keep in mind it is probably the largest group of over achievers under one roof you will ever meet.

Cons: • "Fluid" management which leads to indecisiveness and lots of unnecessary back-and-forth – lack of clarity and direction.
• Political environment in brand marketing teams – high school all over again. Lots of bootlicking going on on a daily basis. Play the game or you lose.
• "Kids" (MTs turned Pdt Managers) who have not worked anywhere else think they know it all and act like their years of work in Loreal correlates to having more "power".
• Staff are constantly overworked and feel a need to ensure you "suffer" with them as well. If you don't buy into the "work over weekend" mentality, you are deemed not committed, not passionate, or not "Loreal-like".
• Terrible for middle managers, especially those outside of the Marketing scope as priority/consideration is always given to Brand teams. 
• Sorely lacking guidance and mentorship for support functions sitting in the Marketing team.
• Borderline workplace bullying with shouting matches and public shaming from peers.
Advice: • So much talk about Transformation and Ethics, yet not much is done to ensure your people follow through. 
• Support roles are hired to complement Marketing team, help them contribute successfully instead of de-prioritising these roles.  
• Stop encouraging high-school games by being clicque-y with bootlicking staff in the team –your job as a leader is to be inclusive and impartial. Playing favourites is damaging.
• Teach female managers and directors to keep their emotions and anger in check. Raising their voices or shouting in the office is not classy. People of management callibre should be more composed and poised than that.
Pros: • Decent staff allowance for quarterly goods across all 20+ brands
• Training opportunities for upskilling and regular workshops (by Google, Facebook etc)
• International mobility
• Good starting ground for Management Trainees due to fast-track career path

Cons: The work life balance was shocking for me. I worked very long hours and so did my superiors, even though most were married and had family. But looking back, overall the work was enjoyable and I gleaned a lot of satisfaction from seeing results first hand. I also learned a lot and was given incomparable levels of responsibility. I definitely don't regret my time here.
Advice: The younger employees needed more role models - someone to model their career after.
Pros: I was on the management trainee track at this company and as a previous reviewer notes, I would highly recommend that anyone entering this company do so this way. Though the initial interview process was grueling, I felt that I was given clear benefits and opportunities for training.

Cons: Sometimes the great amount of responsibility can mean long hours, but generally it is not anything outside the ordinary in comparison to other graduate schemes. A level of uncertainty in terms of jobs after the grad scheme is apparent.
Advice: None
Pros: You get real responsibility right from the off and you work on challenging projects that really make a difference to the business. 

A company where there is real relations between all levels of employees, you get exposure to senior management and are able to showcase your own work. 

A very sociable office culture where you can easily fit in and make a group of friends.

A huge amount of opportunity to learn and improve with a plethora of training courses available.

Cons: You work till late hours, first 2 years I worked till midnight, no much respect for personal life private life balance; company of chaos and confrontation culture. More you fight more you are successful.
Advice: It is important to respect to life/work balance of employees. In the country I worked, we used to work even on Sundays to prepare presentations for regional or headquarter teams visits.
Pros: They give you a lot of responsibilities even if you are at the beginning of your career. You learn fast and a lot. You learn a lot on how to create 360 campaigns, press launches are very important. You need to be on top of fashion, personal care trends.they recruit people from same background so when you work you make many friends also.

Cons: lack of work-life balance.
lack of mentorship unless one is french.
lack of training.
poor systems & processes.
lack of professional development.
lack of management concern for employees.
lack of enough people to do the work.
employees are not empowered.
majority of "people managers" are micromanagers.
constant revolving door of employees.
high level of employee dissatisfaction.
raises are less than cost of living.
employee bonuses are not given at 100% "target" level even if the company makes target levels of sales and profit.
high level of secrecy and poor communication.
too many meetings, no meeting minutes/agendas.
top management level needs to approve of any external hires (even if it is to fill an existing position where someone resigned) - this is Roze or below him that has to approve.
Advice: hire enough employees to do the expected work.
give managers training on how to be human and treat people like humans rather than robots.
less secrecy.
encourage open communications.
Pros: product discount
good name on resume

Cons: -There is no training at all so most of the times you need to figure out by your own how things are done. This can slow down a lot of processes. 
- Work-life balance culture is a mess. People never leave on time (sometimes they stayed until late night hours).
-Micro-managament gives less room for innovation and (also) slow things down.
Advice: -Empower and trust your employees to innovate more.
-Encourage work-life balance. The key to a successful business is happy employees. 
-Invest on training programs fro all levels and not only senior management.
Pros: -High paced environment where you learn a lot. 
-Opportunity to grow and move within the company. 
-Working in one of the biggest companies worldwide with well known brands.

Cons: - Organic culture. Lack of process makes for a lot of rework and mixed responsabilities.
- HR with weak presence and power. Carreer is too dependant on bosses.
- Work involves strategic thinking and a lot of operational. Lack of processes makes operational load too heavy.
- Empowerement is so strong it is always your fault when something goes wrong.
Advice: - Create clearer business objectives to drive performance and ownership.
- HR should evolve to a less "corporate" style into a people development department.
- Flexibility is good, complete lack of process/system is not.
Pros: - Strong innovation spirit
- Creative culture full of rich exchanges
- Build your own carreer: result driven corporation. People that make the difference will be able to grow. From interns to directors.
- Drive for excellence.

Cons: - lack of processes / very disorganized
- "too many cooks": big ordeal to get anything approved and slow time to market because of constant inputs from various heads with different opinions
- poor communication (employess are often the last to know about big changes happening and are left wondering, since there's no clear strategy/input that's passed on to them)
Advice: - less expats, more locals: most of the time we are left with top management that knows they'll only stay for 3-4 years, so they have no interest in building a solid foundation. They build short-term plans, for short-term results...and not always the best decisions for long-term growth
Pros: - ownership of projects
- ease of implementation of new ideas/processes
- diverse & creative environment
- great people

Cons: I first want to firmly that everything I say in here it's true. This is my experience working at the Montreal downtown office in 2018-2019:

Everyone has a feeling that something's "not right" with the work environment. The turnover rate is very high to begin with, and people working until 10pm is not unusual.

They talk openly about ethics and diversity but they don't practice what they preach. It's all just for show to attract young talent. They mostly hire straight out of college because they are inexperienced with how toxic work environments are and they usually put up with it.

I was pushed by a senior manager and HR to work the 10-plus-hour days without complaint. I tried to explain many times that it was detrimental to my mental health and my relationship at home but they defended the "L'Oreal culture" and said it had to do with the "competences" they wanted to see if I ever wanted to get a promotion. I remember feeling sad and depressed but they reprimanded me for not being grateful to be working there. As a disciplinary measure they extended my probation period and I wasn't eligible for a salary increase since then.

When a coworker found me crying in the bathroom she said "Don't worry, I have seen so many people crying here at L'oreal". We even have a term for it at the office: "Burnout Leave".

Besides that, I also witnessed strange incidents such as:

-Black female employees are the less likely to have their contracts renewed and many of them are "subcontractors" which means they get paid less than permanents and don't receive any benefits despite working in the same office.

-A female top manager had to take an extended medical leave after a very stressful period at work and when she came back she was already replaced by a male co-worker.

I worked here for two years and never felt it was safe to go to HR or management when I had issues.
Advice: Be more aware about the toxic environment, it encourages situations such as racism and discrimination to go unnoticed!
Pros: Discounted products at the boutique

Cons: Company is extremely political, work needs to be constantly redone before having to be approved by all the hierarchy. Long working hours, without the feeling you are being valued for it. Good start salary but low yearly increases across the company due to poor sales performance in the last years.
Advice: Stop the old, hierarchical, "devil wears prada" style management. You need to empower your employees and value their work. Secret alliances, special treatments and irrational behavior doesn't create a healthy and productive work environment
Pros: Autonomy at work, hands-on and challenging projects. Less structures sometimes means opportunity for more ideas (not that they are always taken into account). Interesting and intelligent co-workers. Good for resume.

Cons: The only downside at working for L'Oréal is the missing balance between work and life. Personally I missed a company gym, or a company caféteria (there is a very small one). Mireover I would appreciate more facilitating internal organizsations for young mothers.
Advice: None
Pros: Very nice community. Despite the clustering into different brands, the communication across the different brands is great. People are quite young on average, which increases the likelihood of similar interests. L'Oréal is said to be a tough school - and it is. Aside from passion, it requires a high level of self-motivation. Employees that switch to different employers after some years, are grateful for the experiences they have made during their time at L'Oréal.

Cons: Very hierarchal  
Not a very diverse organisation
Ruled from Paris, if you want to advance your career you have to factor in a period of time there
Badly trained managers
Advice: Root out the bad managers and dead wood - there's quite a lot of it. You need to have more operating model reviews so people don't get too comfortable in their roles. Having people in the same roles for over 5 years is wrong and you lose good talent because they're blocking promotions
Pros: Work with great brands
Great name to have on your CV
If you can survive a few years here you can work anywhere

Cons: Everything changes so fast, including your manager, that will implement on the changing system and policy also. If you can adjust to changes, you definitely can fit. Sometimes the products just don't match with the local need, but you have to sell it anyway.
Advice: Put the best man in your strategic places, not only because they are French.  Local people can be trusted to know their own market, sometimes it difficult to foreigner to understand the local market, especially for DMI who never stay long in that country.
Pros: Great friends and ambience. We had the "work hard and play harder" motto for sure. No boundaries beetween bosses and their subordinate. Encourage to think outside the box.

Cons: unprofessional rsm ,
worked in loreal ppd , this wing is just ok
heavy work , moderate pay , just the brand name , absolutely nothing is interesting here

Training is a joke , if u are a bde ,, The attitude of buddies are intolerable , they think they bring the business ,repeating same bi heart classes again and again,they tend to think they are real professional trainer - 

altogether very boring ,, job becomes irritating because of the reason sales person has to also look the job of buddy barbers,nothing exciting
Advice: remove this r buddy system in ppd, it is a headache and nightmare for every sales guy, buddattitude is  intolerable , good people leaving due to unprofessional managers, 

all best to the brand , what a lovely incredible brand!!!!!
Pros: infratrcuture good
 Hr team is good ,., They are world class no doubt.good, Respected brand.

Cons: very strong company culture of seniority and loyalty. Sometimes performance is overlooked in favour of seniority for promotions. Sometimes you may encounter an incompetent boss. It wont last for more than a year for sure but 6 months is minimum. those 6 months might be extremely frustrating.
Advice: none. the management has done a wonderful job in this rapidly expanding enterprise.
Pros: faster growth than many of my peers. salary raised by more than 50% in 1.5 years. A wonderful learning experience with great interaction with seniors and experts in the field. Atmosphere is amazing for a young person to cultivate dynamism and energy.

Cons: - hierarchical organisation, need to use the lines of hierarchy to get things done
- sometimes get a bit lost in details, instead of looking at the bigger picture (but this is inherent to the beauty/fashion business I guess)
Advice: - empower your employees even more to run their projects and fail at some times
- listen more to your employees to stop the high rate of turnover
Pros: - entrepreneurial spirit, room to create things yourself
- innovation at the core, products but also communication model (as of lately)
- young, ambitious colleagues
- lots of responsibilities from the beginning 
- great learning school how to work with people, partners and to get marketing at a very broad level

Cons: All brands have become homogenized into "L'Oreal" no point of difference.  Workers are expected to produce more with less.  The culture is no longer one of elevating talent, but one of pointing fingers.
Advice: Being number one doesn't mean you can continue as you always have.  You have to get out of NY and know what the competition is doing.  The old business model needs refreshing.
Pros: Good benefits, name brands easily recognized.  Built invaluable connections with co-workers in the beauty industry.  Great family of products.

Cons: sometime you need to butter your senior to get recognize, not an equal opportunity employer, in some cases HR dept is very poor in taking decisions . HR hardly do  anything to develop people .
Advice: when you have loyal people working with you for a long time you should give proper dues ,recognition and attention  to them and should understand  their sentiments....
If I got one more chance i would definatly join Loreal Again as Loreal is my First Love
Pros: Nice working environment to work with ,great leaders ,great brands image and where your ideas work,strong marketing team ,

Cons: In terms of logistics - the products by big cosmetics brands owned by L'Oreal often only reach New Zealand months after their release in the USA or overseas.
Advice: None
Pros: The managers, from your Area Manager to everyone in the head office who you will communicate with, are so friendly, supportive, helpful and efficient. They are fair, give positive and encouraging feedback as well as constructive criticism (without making it personal). I enjoyed the training and learning about the history of my brand too - it helps to really cultivate a genuine passion within the company! Best employer I have had so far.

Cons: - Average salaries around 60% vs. other CPG companies.
- It is an 'organic culture'. You need to be comfortable with doing a LOT of work, by yourself, navigate ambiguity and lack of guidance.
- Long and slow growth path to senior management.
- Harsh culture, very independent. Not very collaborative. Senior Management is tough.
Advice: None
Pros: - Biggest beauty company in the world. It is the leading place to start a career in beauty.
- Amazing resources to work with.
- 'Organic' culture. There are not many processes and you have freedom to pursue creative plans, without much burocracy, within certain limits.
- Perks! Tons of beauty products for free or discounted.

Cons: With anything challenging things take time and effort. Expect to work long hours, especially during peak periods. You will be pushed and sometimes stressed but its worth it.
Advice: Modernize outdated and archaic software to more user friendly alternatives. This will improve productivity and help modernize the workforce.
Pros: I've been with L'Oreal for a little over a year now and honestly love working here. My colleagues are smart, competent and hard working. The environment is fast paced and challenging but employees are given every opportunity to  excel and succeed. If you are motivated and ambitious you'll likely really enjoy working here... especially if you have an entrepreneurial spirit.

Cons: If you raise an issue against your team or management, you’re immediately forced to leave the company.  
As a brand who speaks of equality and fairness, they’re quick to brush issues under the carpet especially serious issues such as bullying. 
Staff shop is awful, the products are never available or majority of the stock isn’t even there. Shipping costs crazy amounts. 
No compassion in regards to employees personal life.
Advice: Everyone has flaws, INCLUDING management. Instead of getting rid of those who speak up, listen to them and help improve the working environment. It’s not just “retail”, it’s where we spend a lot of our days and deserve to be understood and respected. Regardless of our job title.
Pros: The pay is good 
Training provided is useful

Cons: It was hard work in Big bazaar bcoz of their such rules but i m glad that i have passed those things nd make my self a part of Brand staff I can say proudly that i have been working in loreal since 2 years
Advice: I looking forword to good company where i can learn nd achieve my goals
Pros: You will learn so much, How we should stand how we should talk, how can we understand customer needs nd want, how can easily convert a shopper to consumer

Cons: - due to fast-paced nature of business, guidance is often lacking making work a lot harder (need to place much greater emphasis on creating clear systems and processes)
- very results driven (understandable) but often feel like individual guidance is a side thought.
- long hours
Advice: Encourage managers to place more emphasis on people rather than results - results come when there is transparency and people feel valued, take the time to iron out systems/processes early - will save time in the long run
Pros: - Great setting to start your career, thrown into the deep end early on 
- lots of great people 
- good perks: summer hours, generous product allowance

Cons: When I went back into a casual role after being made redundant it was like I no longer existed. It took 10 weeks for me to get a Christmas casual contract and then another 5 weeks to get a regular casual contract despite being a loyal employee for years prior.
Advice: None
Pros: I worked at L’Oréal as both a manager and a casual. When i was a store manager I got a lot more support from the area managers and head office. The other L’Oréal staff were also amazing and fun to work with and there were some awesome work benefits with a great range of free products.

Cons: Very individualist complany. French people lead and always will. French language is a must to grow in the company. Top Manager are excellent is few skills and are placed in places that suite those skills. The company doen not look for complete managers, just for people able to deliver in a specific area. Extremely long working days
Advice: Focus on key priorities. Lot's of time wasted in useless details. top management quality at local level very poor
Pros: Exellence is a must, you will learn how not to compromise and how to look for the best. Challenging enviroment enables you to cope with pressure.

Cons: Poor HR mamagement, GM sucks, Management team in one of a Luxe brand is gullible, take side, no ethic, no matter you are a potential person but if they don't like you, you will never be appreciated. Gossiping, making rumors, don't act luxury as the brand represents.
Advice: Treat employees fairly. Be a leadership not a boss. Be professional. Protect employees. Learn more ethic.  Somebody in retail management level is unqualified and doesn't know how to manage a team, act like uneducated one.
Pros: Benefit, bonus fixed, profit sharing, public holidays,  fund, location, compensation & benefit could be better but that is alright.

Cons: Long working hour and hard to balance work and life
Poor supporting departments ( ex. IT ) 
People are very aggressive in certain divisions
Advice: Give more power to young managers
Be open to employees from non-French speaking countries. It's very obvious that employees who don't speak French has less chance to get promoted
Learn English. It's funny to see a French senior manager cannot give an English presentation.
Pros: Opportunities to work in different subsidiaries and headquarters
Well known brand names
Reasonable salary 
Nice to have on the resume

Cons: - Barely anyone finished at 5pm -- Sometimes you notice, sometimes you don't. But it evens out when you get to leave early on Fridays, so there's no complaining there. If you love your team, staying later isn't as bad as people make it seem.
Advice: None
Pros: - Great starting salary 
- Fun and open environment
- If you have passion for the industry, you will be amazed at what goes on behind the scenes
- Option to work from home during the year 
- Finish at 3pm on Fridays in the fall/winter and 12:30pm on Fridays in the summer 
- Great benefits

Cons: People left leaders not organisation! The top management were unethical and disrespectful. Business is more important so it's OK for leaders to behave unethically  .. a lot of lip service on their people mission and vision, a lot of "writing on the wall" but the truth is ????!!!!
Advice: Walk the Talk! Unethical behaviour leaders should not be in the organisation.  top leaders must show best example, Respectful and act in ethical manner with high integrity, don't undermine the locals
Pros: Dynamic, Great Products, Love the speed and empowerment

Cons: Dictatorship-like management; use-and-abuse employee relationship, including underpayment for hours and effort; the lack of international scope in local offices; promises of nurturing individual talent were silenced and virtually buried once role begins; micro-management by senior management of even the smallest matters; disrespectful attitude of senior management towards subordinates.
Advice: Objectively gauge middle and lower-management's sentiment towards senior management at local offices, respect and develop the idiosyncratic skills of each employee rather than make them fit into the mold of the role.
Pros: Gain understanding of a successful FMCG, large French company with a good reputation worldwide.

Cons: Internal political games and power fights, old habits, agility to change, inexistent project management, poor management competencies, listenning and transparency,  The hierarchy opinion only prevails.
Advice: Be more brave and don't be fooled! More transparency, 360° and honest feedbacks to keep the talented one. Take really into account the feedbacks and inputs from the teams. Put in place a real participative way of managing people.
Pros: Autonomy, freedom to design our job and develop innovative projects, stimulating exposure, real and strong company culture, wonderfull products to work on, many opportunities to grow.

Cons: Not all managers are yet aligned with the new way of leading teams
Obtaining bonuses depends on many criteria and the negotiation is not evident
Advice: Make sure that the group's values and action plans are understood and embodied before being shared by the managers, because not all of them are, unfortunately
Pros: Human enterprise permitting personal and professional expansion
The surpassing of oneself and one's job is encouraged and can lead to many projects
Overall, we can envisage a career in this group from the point of view of job, remuneration, social benefits but also in personal/professional training. 
The links between people are very strong

Cons: The company on the decline financially
Advice: The company cannot go far while making losses. Management needs to make the right decisions especially when it comes to sales and marketing, launches as well as fighting for market share. It also needs some consistency at the helm. 2 years for an MD is very little time. You need a strong local MD who can manage the interference from zone and Paris so that to create time and space for delivering results. Failure to this the company might shut its doors.
Pros: Exposure especially for young employees.

Cons: Very lean structure, I did not have a life while I was there. I was so busy I didn't have time to take advantage of their training opportunities or leave benefits. Went to work while sky was dark and came home when sky was dark. Didn't have a supportive manager as well, I was the third person to leave the company after a year in the same role.
Advice: None
Pros: I was at the Singapore branch, excellent benefits, training opportunities, generally good productive people to work with, opportunities to showcase your work and shine

Cons: Chaotic, no structure, lack of organization, very ineffective, spending hours and days on searching for the smallest information, no processes, not very creative, hierarchical, no recognition or reward for your work, misleading promises for growth opportunities, bad pay, cannot open windows in office, AC system repeatately makes everyone sick, lots of drama
Advice: Appreciation and recognition for the work, stop the misleading career promises!, find a solution for intern housing in Geneva, stop cultivating the chaos in the organization!
Pros: Great name, free products, nice office, some nice collegues, participation to some events, not too stiff, open-minded people, multinational employees

Cons: Not sure if it is a great place to grow and settle down but if you have an opportunity to work there, don't miss it. The salaries are still below the business benchmark. Home office does not exist in their vocabulary.
Advice: Home office, guys. I think we are the only company of our market which do not do home office. Salaries could be much better, that's why most of the people I know have left.
Pros: It is a great place to learn and develop. It is always changing. There's international mobility. It is a very inclusive company, one of its values is diversity.

Cons: I didn't learn anything valuable outside the company. I was constantly asked to fix small things. Few real responsibilities. They simply hire interns to do jobs that no one wants to do, like write emails and call creative agency to ask them to do small changes to commercials (i.e. make it bold, please more blue...)
As in any marketing department that is not the headquarter, there is no strategic view. It's pure operational marketing: execution of what Paris decides. People are stressed to  execute things that someone else decided and they scream at you too often.
Inefficient processes and old systems.
Advice: Create a Corporate Culture. Innovate processes (you are not really digital if you only use social media). Offer yoga classes to Group product managers
Pros: Exposure to all firm's functions and see complexity of a multinational company.

Cons: No career or development plans. You are being pushed to whatever job they can find, as long as it is hassle free for them. Some of my friends got even lower rank jobs (yet with the same salary) because "nothing else was available" at the time. 
Changing divisions is always challenging and almost impossible for people if you come from active cosmetics or worse, the professional products division. Top jobs often end up being given to CPD or Luxe employees. 
People who work their way up the corporate ladder are usually the ones that waited long enough and built the right connections, and avoided all the bullets. Performance reviews are a joke: you can demonstrate consistent performances year on year and still being left aside if you do not have sponsors. Darwinism at its best: if a top guy does not like you and you deliver a poor presentation just once, your career progression will come to a halt. I missed a promotion once for the sole reason that the head of the division "did not like me" although my track record was flawless and my line manager and the team leader both sponsored me. 
Still a lot of toxic managers too, some of them being clearly protected by top management. One HRD told me once that "X can't be removed because he/she is protected by the CEO". 
Most of the people getting promoted fit the same description. I can always tell who gets promoted in any team: the highly extroverted, self confident, risk taker, action oriented type. Don't try to be a strategic thinker in this company, or boast your "soft skills" or your 'inclusive" management style. What they like is the charismatic egocentric superman/woman type who can turnaround any situation on his own. 
They do try to change the corporate culture but the guys fostering it are the same guys who contributed to building what was deemed a toxic workplace 10 years ago.
The annual employee survey is now part of every manager's KPI: however,I have heard stories of teams being pressurized to deliver positive feedbacks in exchange of career advancement although this is hopefully rare. 
Finally, the learning in L'Oreal is not as good as the company claims: most of the training is now done online with random classes that are usually poor in content apart from a few MOOC that they advertise a lot. Personal development programs like coaching are reserved for senior management.
Advice: Build real career plans. Empower HR and stop promoting the same archetype of managers that thrive thanks to their networking abilities and interpersonal skills more than their actual performances.  Remove the passionate and emotional judgements from performance reviews with clear and objective KPI's. Change all the senior staff who built a toxic workplace and now slows down the cultural shift.
Pros: Great brands, lots of smart people, some of them being extremely friendly although they usually do not last long in the organization.

Cons: No worklife balance, 
L'Oreal recruits people from high education background in prestigious universities, the elite, but asks them to act like sheeps, 
interns do not get  hired even if they work crazy hours for months, 
very authoritarian environment, you cannot criticize management
Very competitive environment
Advice: treat nicely and fairly your employees, use more meritocracy, balance your life, show more respect to people in general (business partners, colleagues, customers...)
Pros: Good pay, good products for free, very young, good looking and "cool" employees, good to have that company name on your resume

Cons: Even if you ace the ratings,  you can't beat the colleague who sucked up and got fast tracked. Pay scale is hardly competent although HR keeps screaming from the roof tops that we are market aligned.
Advice: To have your favourites is human,  but at least be aware of true talent that exists in your midst. Stop discouraging the hard workers.
Pros: Opportunities to learn are galore. Work culture is what you make of it,  but it's fun and stressful.  Performance gets rated for target achievement as well as networking.

Cons: - Things move slower than most places.
- The different divisions are still very separated.
Advice: Cultivate more cross-divisional collaboration and knowledge sharing - digital is leading the way on this. My only other advice is to keep up the fantastic work.
Pros: + Everyone here is driven. It's great to be with other motivated people.
+ The company ACTUALLY cares about its people - compared to wanting to look like it cares.
+ Even in the busiest of times you're never too overwhelmed. Enabled through management initiatives and your working environment.
+ We live and breathe beauty.
+ Ethics isn't a buzz word. This comes out in everything we do.

Cons: - The culture nurtured by the leaders (especially the one who's been there for long time) is very political and very bossy. The way the senior managers communicate is very top down with sometimes disrespectful attitude
- It's not so transparent, guys from french came to local office just to be served with presentation and market visit. They didn't communicate anything to local office and just make their own "gang"
Advice: None
Pros: - Strong business fundamentals due to the presence in the categories that are complementary and relatively strong growth 
- Great brands 
- Positive outlook due to the strong presence in emerging countries
- Vibrant teammates and environment

Cons: Manager expects my time and comittment after office hours. Demands the use of Whatsapp on top of emails. Not sensitive and very disruptive to my family and personal life.
Advice: I'm leaving soon, for only one reason - my direct manager.
Pros: Prestigious brand, many free products. Good atmosphere, wonderful colleagues. Company hires good people.

Cons: Management is hierarchical and old fashioned - a lot of people nearing retirement hold the top jobs and they never, ever leave!  
If you have experience outside L'Oreal forget about it as no one cares.   They will want you to adapt to their way of doing things.
Advice: Listen to teams, manage down and stop sucking up to your boss.  Get rid of Managers who have been promoted to their level of incompetence and give younger managers a chance to do things differently or the company will stagnate and eventually fail.  Accept people who come from outside!
Pros: L'Oreal challenges you and ensures you give your best everyday and as a result you learn quickly to be extremely productive! If you can do it well at L'Oreal you will probably succeed anywhere!

Cons: The grad scheme can seem a little aimless when compared to the internship. This is due to the grad scheme being project based and the internship being operational. So the quality of the scheme depends on the quality of the project given. As is life.
Advice: Perhaps allow graduates to be operational for a while before taking on projects as it can be difficult to take on a project when you do not yet understand the operation.
Pros: There is a great work life balance. The employee demographic is young and energetic. The office is in a great location. The pay is good. Everyone is very friendly.

Cons: High Turnover and constant change of management in the company.  It gets tiring having to re-establish relationship with new managers, in 1 year you can have 2-3 different managers.  All the hard work you did to prove yourself with your previous manager can be wasted.  Because here, it doesn't matter what you did last month, what are you doing this minute?

LONG hours.  If there is an international visit be prepared to work weekends and late evenings.  Sometimes these visits are a surprise and they tell you to prepare in 2-3 weeks (mostly rare).  You end up preparing 100 different ppt. slides, 5 of which might actually be used.  The entire visit process is such a waste of time, you're basically putting on a big show for the big international bosses.  I haven't heard bad things about them, I've typically heard that they were pretty friendly, but it's just a waste of time.  Everyone is stressed out and running around like chickens with their heads cut off.   

Office Politics.  This is soo huge here.  Like the comment above, its all about putting on a show.  Making it seem like you're doing so much work and its amazing.  Everything is controlled by HR, and they are watching/analyzing you're every move. It's all about if they like you, performance has less to do than you would expect.  Lots of backstabbing.  But at first its so hidden, you don't realize anything once you have the rosy shades on from being so excited to get hired.  Then slowly you see cases where upper management suddenly vanishes from the company.  People will throw you under the bus to get ahead.  Poor value system.  Don't trust anyone!  Everyone is looking out for themselves.  

Logistics and IT sucks here.  You'd think that a company that is so cutting edge in innovation, they would invest more in their logistics management systems and operations.  Especially being a CPG giant.  Expect computers from the mid 19th century (kidding. but seriously: crappy IT).  It slows down your work, frustrating.  

Poor management (sometimes):  If you have a bad manager, all i say is GOOD LUCK! you can be the hardest working, most intelligent employee and if they don't like you, you're screwed.  If your manager doesn't know what they're doing, GOOD LUCK! this typical doesn't happen, but it does (i guess this is a risk at all companies)  But don't dare voice your opinions to HR, because their motto is "too bad, its your responsibility to deal with it"
Advice: Relax, it's just a stick of lipstick.  You're not curing cancer.
Pros: Discounted products
Great training opportunities in other cities (Paris, NYC)
The pride of telling people you work at L'Oreal
Opportunities for movement, both up or different brands
Good salary
Great opportunities for recent grads, MBA or otherwise
If you're in Marketing, this can be a really great company to work for because they spend a lot of $ on marketing
Amazing learning experience
A lot of responsibility early on in your career (if they like you)
Young crowd
innovative products 
lost of investment PR (luminato, tiff etc.)

Cons: difficult to have a working and private life balance, difficult to get support when you face difficulties with your line manager, difficult to evolve if you don't know the good person (lack of transparency in the career management sometimes)
Advice: Take the principle of managing with generosity as a value that has to guide your day to day business. Making line managers accountable for the way they manage their team in stead of taking only into account the quantifiable objectives set.
Pros: Multinational company that has a lot of mean to develop its staff, compensation and benefits, multiplicity of career paths, autonomy

Cons: Complete and utter disorganisation, hidden by 'being entrepreneurial'. I.E. Do what you want, and if it works, pat on the back, but if it doesn't, I would have some stitches ready to patch up the knife wound lodged in your back (metaphorically speaking).

I can see the company are trying to make it a nice environment for their staff, such as implementing agile working hours (something that has been in the industry for about 15 years already in other companies), but it just doesn't work. 
People at the top of L'Oreal are far too stubborn, old school, and don't believe in change. Therefore, if you dare work from home, which is the new policy, I wouldn't bank on getting a promotion anytime soon.
In my opinion, the only way L'Oreal is going to become a top place to work is if they get a good old sweeping brush, and have a good clean out of old management at the top, to then bring in fresh thinkers who are not brainwashed by the old school French power house that rule the roost.
Advice: Go on an training course at a company like Google or another top place to work FMCG company (check the times top places to work for inspiration), take all the learnings you can from what they do, and then implement it at L'Oreal. 
Sounds easier said than done, but there is no other business in the industry that has a higher staff turn over than L'Oreal.
They must be doing something right, and L'Oreal must be doing something wrong.
Pros: Great business experience due to a lot of responsibility. You are basically put under that much pressure that you are forced to learn at a rapid pace. Great if you want to go on the apprentice.
People are brilliant though, and you can have a great laugh.

Cons: Where to begin... The teams are extremely low on headcount, to the point where flexible/home working had to be brought in a few years ago and this has been readily jumped to try and escape 60 hour weeks (which were and still are the norm). I've had colleagues who have constructively complained about the working hours effectively managed out of the company for being "inefficient". Everyone knew what was happening so it just meant that people stopped complaining about the workload. Unfortunately the one's managed out for inefficiency (not me) tended to be the 'nice guys/girls'.

The working environment is very cut throat. Individual teams seem to work well but cross team working is difficult as everyone is trying to come up with the best idea (and then take the credit). NAMs, SNAMs etc not only have to do their own jobs but are also organised into 'brand teams', which are essentially trade marketing roles. This is all extra work on top of your day job (whether you look after Tesco or Poundland it's the same). Writing presentations on the way to customer meetings was normal because you just couldn't find the time due to all the internal priorities. These 'brand teams' go some way to explain the extra 20ish hours everyone does each week that is unpaid.  

Talking of pay, it's low for the industry. NAMs start somewhere around the late £30's to mid £40's, and SNAMs are in the early £40's to low £50's sort of range. When you add in the long working hours, which means on average you're earning somewhere around the £13 - £16 per hour range as a SNAM, you have to question whether your life and investment in your education has been worth it for that, particularly being based in London.

The final thing I will add is that when I decided to leave and was interviewing I had to defend the fact that I had worked at L'Oreal to 2 different companies that I interviewed with, which was surprising. L'Oreal workers are seen as arrogant by the wider FMCG companies and I found myself having to say in interviews that I was not the typical L'Oreal employee in order to show that I would fit in with their company cultures.
Advice: Try to give your sales teams more choice in what they do in terms of commercial planning - having a junior product manager telling a SNAM or Business Controller what to do in this field will only ever lead to conflict.

Remember that you're employing a young team who do actually want to experience London life during the week.

Think retention! The churn rate at L'Oreal is ridiculous and it feels like people are leaving every other week.
Pros: - Product discounts and adhoc staff sales
- Given responsibility early on
- Open plan team seating, very few behind glass doors

Cons: No chance to earn money. The salary is twice low, than the competitors propose.  Talent development  is absolutely undeveloped: any training, any real support from HR .
Advice: It' s time to become more people oriented. During last 2-3 years company lost a lot of talented professionals. Thanks God L'Oreal brand is strong enough to sell him self. But today real iconic Brand has to shine in all facets, to be unconditionally perfect.
Pros: Exclusive opportunity for the students to start carrier. It's good to get "L" in the first line of the CV. Great payed marketing internship and possibility to understand how is modern international FMCG business works.

Cons: - High turnover (never a good sign). 
- On average, 1 person quits every month.
- Business model is based on very young workers (right out of college) taking management positions to keep salaries to a bare minimum, therefore the only real decision makers are the Directors. 
- Most employees earn 60% less than average market salaries in Panama across the board (sales, marketing, etc.).
- Indecisive and bureaucratic upper management.
- Ugly company culture (long hours, horrible bratty bosses, sucking up is rewarded, very political and highly hierarchical)
- Absolutely no work-life balance.
- No real respect for the local culture, since all upper managers are expats.
- Locals are considered the "help" and not really considered for anything other than lower status jobs.
Advice: None.
Pros: - Nice location of main office.
- Good school to learn sales, marketing, supply and then get out within 2 years.

Cons: - Very little room to progress
- High employee turnover
- Unforgiving French culture
- People were scared to be seen leaving before 6pm
- Interns regularly in tears
- Horrific work/life balance unless you work in demand planning/supply chain
- Bottleneck hierarchy
- Extremely disorganised
- If you don't speak French, don't bother!
Advice: Treat people how you would like to be treated.  There were only a handful of people who I admired for their management style, as the rest either embodied micro-management to the extreme, or none whatsoever
Pros: - Free products
- Huge amount of responsibility
- Most of the workforce are really young
- Canteen was generally good
- Post room staff are the best, so be nice to them!

Cons: The team sizes are small which leads to a bit of more workload per person but at the same time, it gives you opportunities to learn a lot of different things.
Advice: None
Pros: The company is really employee friendly. Working here has helped bring out my creative side in make-up. Management takes care of you in all possible ways. The project I am pursuing in the internship is a real time problem faced by L'Oréal. My inputs are evaluated and sometimes they are implemented. This shows how much importance they give to summer internship program. By working on this, I can implement various concepts which I studied in MBA in real time.

Cons: Too agile, no career progression/ development planned. People come and leave in 2-3 years, taking with them entire knowledge on brand with no cross training for the junior ones. Mid management are then hired but they bail in half a year due to poor work life balance and this expectation that you’re hired to solve a problem with little to no context.
Advice: More for loreal to grow in having structured communications for new-comers, taking over database without any handover. Most importantly to plan for career opportunities and development, high turnover rate isn’t helping business urgencies or morale.
Pros: Young culture. Lively workplace. Trendy topics

Cons: I took a managerial position in sales for a short time, then decided to quit. In L'Oreal your career depends not on your professionalism, but on your relationship with management. Whether they like you or not. Criticism is not welcome, you have to say that all is fine, even if it is not so. Speaking French means a lot too. Top managers do not care to answer your mails, business processes are not structured.
I worked in Ukraine, maybe in the L'Oreal USA the situation is different.
Advice: Respect your employees. Aren't we worth it?
Pros: International company with a name. A lot of products are given free to the employees.

Cons: After the first 3 yrs. the learning curve flattens and politics takes over. High turnover of employees. Above middle management everything is about politics. Promotion and rewards are not based on performance or facts but rather politics.
Advice: Move the company towards a more performance based rewards enviroment.
Pros: Fast pace environment, work & social becomes one, competition between brands and teams is high (which is both good and bad), you get full responsibility (and accountability) from day 1. One of the best marketing schools in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods.

Cons: If you dont want to work hard and surpass yourself,  its better to choose another company. Some managers would need to update their management skills.
Advice: Listen more to younger generation and encourage collaboration and collective spirit
Pros: You can have a carreer you would never have imagined for yourself, just because HR People care about Who you really are,  and challenge you about your project even your dream. And you will meet really different people, all very smart,  différent,  unique,  and with strong personnalities

Cons: Quick promotion due to high turnover 
High turnover can lead to very Junior teams and lack of experience 
A lot of time spent retraining and trying to prevent history repeating rather than progressing as a unit 
Pay grades are secretive
Advice: Be aligned in objectives and filter down to teams 
Share career paths with teams 
Ensure all teams have the same opportunity, and indeed take this opportunity, to have outings 
Train managers in giving appropriate feedback 
Give equal training
Pros: Vibrant, enthusiastic, young team 
Quick promotion if you succeed and overdeliver
Annual conference abroad if good performance 
Discounted products 
Annual profit share for FTEs

Cons: Very disorganized and immature people. The entire culture of the company is based on backstabbing others, and all the departments being pitted against each other. 

Expect to work long hours to get the job done because budgets keep getting cut and departments are understaffed, and also because management is constantly changing their mind about everything.
Advice: Get organized! You should be supporting your employees rather than throwing them under the bus to make yourselves look good.
Pros: Nice offices, summer hours, decent pay, great benefits, and discount on products. The cafeteria has decent food too, and there is a daycare on site.

Cons: Very chaotic company. 
No business etiquette at all:
-No meeting is started or finished at planned time. 
-Not even all meetings are scheduled prior to the time of meeting it self.
-Nobody read emails at all - you have to use whatsapp (your personal one) or other messengers for business communication, so you can not escape them after working hours.
No work/life balance at all, just work/work balance, which is cool but to some extent only.
All decisions can be changed in a second after they were made up and nobody worries.
No processes and procedures (stable or working, or any at all). Especially in Marketing department.
No documentation about projects is created, When employee left - all information about his/her job is lost totally and you have to start from the sketch again.

Too many agencies and third parties involved in the routine procedures (especially in online marketing) - no inner expertize at all
Digital managers are overloaded extremely  as one person basically has to launch and make up and running whole e-shop by his/her own - which is not productive at all, as this person has no time to analyze what is it he or she is doing.
Advice: Create inner expertise inside of the teams, not in outsource agencies  - traffic management, SMM, CRM in every brand team specifically (1 person for every brand, not 1 person for 1 division).

Hire additional devoted people for digital, as current people have no time to eat or sleep or fulfill all responsibilities they have in a proper way.

Create processes. Document them and force teams to follow the processes.

Implement business etiquette trainings, as people do not know, why to insert agenda in the meeting in outlook, or how to create/use Webex.

And start from higher management, as they did not bother to follow their agendas during visits.
Pros: Competitive Salary, friendly atmosphere at the office, "Start up like" approach. You can take as much responsibilities as you can bear.

Cons: Little preparation for individual contributors becoming managers, what can impact the team during the years while the manager is building their people management skills. Many decisions, not necessarily big decisions, still need the final work from central headquarters in France, what can sometimes undermine efficiency and autonomy.
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, open-mindedness, innovative. In many ways, L'Oréal is what they call an "organic" company, where you build connections and work flows across departments, what makes work more efficient, reflecting your own way of working, to make things happen. Close interaction with different departments and divisions are also a great opportunity to learn.

Cons: You are not guaranteed a graduate role at the end of your internship and the way the talent team judge your performance is beyond flawed. If you don't look or 'fit' the L'Oreal head office brand you won't make it far. They rate your performance based on the big projects you've been involved in but not everyone has the opportunity to be part of those.
Advice: Review the internship / graduate process before you lose talented graduates that have spent a year contributing to the business. The company couldn't survive without interns.
Pros: staff shop
staff sale
a lot of responsibility from the beginning

Cons: Enormous pressure, stressful working environment, long decision making processes, countries are extremely dependent on HQ, employees are not valued
Advice: Value your employees! A lot of knowledge, expertise & ideas get lost due to the heavy fluctuation making the internal processes very slow and create wrongdoings. The company could be so much more profitable with a little more employee satisfaction through personal valuation and by employing managers that have a people-focus and know how to motivate their teams!
Pros: Great responsibility, marketing freedom due to big marketing budget, dynamic & young people, international exposure

Cons: With respect to other global companies, unfortunately there is no work structure at all. You may be responsible for everything or nothing. It is real chaotic environment which may be sometimes very inefficient. Also I should add that no work-life balance, you may receive an e-mail on sunday night and it is totally normal thing for here not an extraordinary campaign period or whatsoever.
Advice: Encourage work-life balance
As i know, according to top management chaotic environment is good for the company' development but it totally blaze high turn over rates and dissat
Pros: Young and dynamic environment is the best side of the Loreal

Cons: Although I never experienced it first hand, it seems that my marketing counterparts were often overworked or unhappy. Sales generally thrived in the fast paced L'Oreal environment.
Advice: None
Pros: L'Oreal was a great training place for new grads.
Having been part of the commercial management trainee program, I was able to learn much about the retail landscape managing my own territory as well as get AC Nielsen training &amp; insights from the KAM's. There was a lot of flexibility being on the road - a role that was less stressful than my marketing/finance counterparts. Benefits were great.

Cons: - overhours, even you need to leave the office on time, often you finish work from home until late at night
- depending on the teams often hostile environment
- feedback on incompetent leaders are continuously ignored by HR and those manager keep getting promoted as long as the sales numbers are correct
- a lot of talks on inclusiveness, but mostly as a PR story
Advice: None
Pros: - nice lifestyle with the job 
- young teams who are willing to bring the brands forward
- lots of responsibilities from the start

Cons: Probably need to be French to make it higher.
Few women in top posts.
The style of management is very 'authoritarian' and control-oriented.
Goals and objectives are infrequently written and rarely clear-- making year end interviews a systematic surprise.
Work efficiency is hampered by bad time management and poor IT.
Advice: The diversity of senior management is a real issue.  This needs to be considered for the long term health of the company.
Pros: In general, the opportunities at L'Oreal are there for the taking, but (a) you need to have very thick skin along the way, and (b) ready to work the long hours.  
There is a good amount of freedom to try new things for such a large company.
The internal training programme is robust.

Cons: Too large and sometimes a little too corporate.  Some brands need to be refreshed but management is still used to how the brand is and not as open to change.
Advice: Be open to different ideas, even if may be not the usual expectations from the brand.  Could also work on improving the work/life balance of employees there and empasizing more collaboration within departments.
Pros: A great place to learn about marketing in the beauty industry and the name will open a lot of doors in the future.  Projects are fun and exciting.

Cons: the same operations, no creativity and development, no leadership culture, values only on the paper, not structured documents, no transition, luck of synergy between department - each department work for own goal, not for common company goal
Advice: - culture - leaders should inspire, develop and coach people 
- HR should care about retention rate - a lot of quality people leave 
- more synergies between departments
- more structured and optimized processes and documents
Pros: Wide scale of operations, intensive work every day, adequate managers, fast growth and opportunities, good office, managers give responsibility

Cons: Some managers are great from a technical point of view, but lack a lot of people management skills. 
Since it's a very popular company, some managers have a philosophy towards their employees of "if you're not happy, 300 people want your job".
Advice: Please keep an eye on the mid-level managers and make sure they are taking care of their employees.
Pros: Good company to learn a lot, let's you lead projects and suggests new ways of doing thing. 
Innovation is valued and recognized.
Younger age average makes it a dynamic work environment. 
Good trainings and career development up to mid-level manager.

Cons: Several operational work, which occupates a considerable part of your working time. Consequently, it rests a few time in order to invest your effort in activities that are ablw to generate a bigger impact.
Advice: Looking directly to the intern job, I believe that the sector's manager could look with more careful to the intern job, providing bigger chalenges so that they can also contribute to the development of this intern.
Pros: Considerable gain of technical knowledge  about  different kinds of packaging and, besides that, an globlal understanding  of the whole chain of a new  launch.

Cons: You will not be able to leave and go Back to normal GT, if you are working in PPD devision of Loreal. (Keep that in Mind)
HR is just for names sake.
Every thing is under control of 3-4 senior level people, some times does not feel that its a MNC.
System and Process and not good and not even at Par with Locoal Organisations level.
Advice: Interdivisional Transfers should be done every 3 years.
Data should come to teams, as its usually flowing the wrong way always.
Authenticity of data is also a big concern.
Pros: Good Policies
Foreign Trips
On time salary
Good Growth Opportunity

Cons: -  Low salary and bonuses compared to other companies in the industry.
-  Work/life balance is almost non-existent.
-  Unless you have a degree, there is pretty much no way to advance (even if you're one of the very best employees).  Basically no career path.
-  Tiny or non-existent raises.
-  Attitude is that we should be grateful to have a job (to explain a $0 raise), grateful to work for the #1 brand and that there are tons of candidates chomping at the bit for our jobs.
Advice: Pay attention to the great talent that you already have and work on developing them for higher positions.  Offer some type of career path so that you can retain the employees who have worked so hard to develop the brand that they take so much pride in.

Offer attractive pay that exceeds what our competitors are paying (if we're #1, don't we have enough money to pay well?????).   As someone currently looking at other companies, I know that competitors are paying up to $25k more annually for similar positions.  I also know that one of the other L'Oreal PPD brands pays that much more for a lateral job.  That is a bit demoralizing.  Also, offer a bonus structure that is directly related to performance so we can feel appreciated for a job well done.

Overall, I LOVE what I do and feel a great affinity for the company.  It would be perfect if it wasn't for the poor compensation.
Pros: -  Great opportunities for personal and professional development (best thing I ever did).
-  Prestige of working for the #1 pro product company in the industry.
-  Looks great on a resume.
-  Wonderful and talented employees that provide a richness of creativity and ideas.
-  Great emotional attachment to the brand.

Cons: Lack of management skills, lack of good structure and good standardized processes, very poor compensation package compared to competitors,  poor introduction to company and training, work/life balance is for some non-existing
Advice: Spend more time developing the employees, search for candidates internally, have more structure in in the way you do business, develop managers through training and courses
Pros: Great name, great brands, good products, trusted with a lot of responsibility from the start, people are proud to work for L'Oréal, International feel, great collegues

Cons: Poor HR policies. Growth is fully dependent on your immediate Boss. Worst part is, if s/he isn't happy with you for whatever reason, you can't survive in the company. The company feels, boss is always right.
Advice: Strengthen HR. Current Training module isn't of much use. Training should be need basis. Also, change from one department to another department (eg sales to Marketing) is an improvement Area.
Pros: Good company to work with. Good products and good in Marketing those products.

Cons: Too much internal politics &amp; way too many meetings. Your career progression in many cases depends more on your networking and your manager's endorsement than your actual achievements, input and commitment.
Advice: L'Oreal needs younger, more diverse leadership of people from different backgrounds and a stronger commitment to change the hierarchical L'oreal culture -' simplicity ' values, which are really inspiring and progressive have not yet been embraced by all senior stakeholders.
Pros: Smart and inspiring people to work with and learn from, exciting projects to be part of, big focus on innovation and entrepreneurship, flexible working

Cons: - Location a bit average for a multinational like L'Oreal
Advice: None
Pros: It's been a year already and here's what I can say already: 
- On-boarding process very clear and user-friendly, HR team will have everything ready prior joining
- Young culture, everyone is so friendly, made lots of friends
- Dynamic environment, processes are so prompt and simple
- Lots of outings and events, great work-life balance
- Lots of talents! High caliber of recruitment
- Perfect employer for Corporate Social Responsibility and Ethics enthusiasts
- Various sports' activities, especially for football and volleyball players (they traveled to Milano for a tournament between different L'Oreal's countries!!)

Cons: - Stressful, unrealistic timelines.
- Worked long hours with little recognition.
- Don't believe in creating processes, expect existing staff to take on more work as they make people redundant. 
- No work life balance - If you are unwell or have annual leave, management still call you on you on your days off. Expected to work  and still check your emails and reply.
- No proper handover for new staff, expects staff to pick up and run with it. 
- Every decision is controlled by overseas Executive team.
- They get staff to spend useless amouts of time of internal presentation packs, when they should be concentrating on fixing and upgrading their internal processes and systems.
- Management level are in their own bubble and need to see and experience how other companies managing and operating.
- High staff over - except for the Executive team, they promote from within.
- While many companies are still encouraging to work from home*Covid* L'Oréal wants to staff to come back into the office asap. - They say they are flexible but really they want to see staff in the office.
Advice: Most of the Management level are in their own bubble. Some have never worked anywhere else except L'Oréal, so they don't  get to experience how other companies managing and operating.
Need to have a  mix of New management, fresh pair of eyes to bring new ideas and give an outside perspective. Otherwise the company will be in the same cycle, with high continuous staff turnover and Ex staff bad mouthing about the terrible experience they had with L'Oréal. Great brands, but don't have a good reputation in the marketplace.
Listen to your staff if they say they're stressed or overworked take action and make sure you can help them. Don't call or text/interrupt them on their days off, annual & sick days are taken for a reason.
Pros: - Summer hours 2pm finish on a Friday.
- Staff shop perks.
- Free department products. 
- Good colleagues staff are great.
- Great range of global brands under L'Oréal.

Cons: Very competitive between depts, and very heavy workload.  Even recreational activities are done with a mindset to win, win, win.
Advice: There were too many changes to the higher management at 1 time that made the employees totally insecure.  Due to this, there were a lot of rumours & paranoia going around, and hence led to disrespect towards the management.  It will be great to ensure that changes are made transparent to staffs.
Pros: Has great perks like products & sometimes beauty services done by trainees. Fun environment

Cons: Many ad hoc tasks/deadlines, overtime everyday, relatively lower salary than other companies especially when you count all the overtimes (no overtime compensation for most of staff). High turnover of staff, hence lot of new staff which does not improve efficiency.
Advice: Organize better timeline for deadlines, invest in automation and staff, dare to say no to headquarter to improve worklife balance
Pros: Young, fun and international culture, good benefits. If you are mobile, willing to work hard, speak both French and Chinese, your carreer opportunities are very good!

Cons: very political, a lot of chances for management trainees to grow, however, if you were not joined as management trainees, there would be very hard for the company to promote you internally
Advice: be opened mind to people who can preform, not only focusing on growing the management trainees, a lot of staff who joined from external firms who might have amazing experience which would be a pity if they don't have a chance to grow
Pros: There were a lot of opportunities in the company, you can take on roles on different brands, and lead different projects, good trainings and exposure within the company.

Cons: Work/life balance. Nobody leaves at 5 although it is when work suppose to end. A lot of stress from your boss/top management. 
Fast-paced environment with considerable amount of stress but still takes a lot of time to get anything done.
Advice: Work/life balance needs to be improved. Keep your talents in your company by providing more free time for employees to spend with family/friends.
Pros: Pay is pretty good as an intern
Nice co-workers
A lot of side benefits (including annual sales tickets, percentage off on all loreal products for employees, etc. You female friends/girlfriend would suddenly love you more for no reason at all)

Cons: Very operationally driven even as a Manager or in managerial role. Can be political at times and culturally its a dog eat dog world. Long working hours at times and no work life balance. Diversity is not prevalence in the organisation though it is what the company has been promoting.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefit and accessibility to beauty products, events etc. Additionally, free lunch is provided every Tuesday and Thursday of the week. Good for career advancement as the organisation values internal promotion than external hiring.

Cons: Pay is not competitive
Depends on luck - sometimes u get bosses that doesnt explain why we do things but just want things to be done.
Advice: Allow more feedback and speak to all tiers of staff not just middle management. 
Change the way of working. 
There are too many level of hierarchies and different interpretations via the managers and the ones executing doesn't relate if they don't meet the right managers
Pros: Face pace 
Given the Flexibility
Able to feedback and voice out
Opportunities not just given to seniors
A lot of fun
A lot of personal development and learning

Cons: -A lot of communication is in french. It is sometimes difficult to communicate effectively with people in your or other divisions because they don't speak english very well.
-Things are very corporate and therefore sometimes inflexible and slow.
Advice: Keep it up, a great company to work for!
Pros: -Prestige
-Respect
-Opportunity
-Challenge 
-Compensation
-Management and coworkers
It is a well managed, well run company that understands both it's customers and employees. Respects the past and looks ahead. An interesting group of people to connect with from different brands and divisions. So much potential. Doesn't accept second rate or not delivering results.

Cons: - Poor leadership - as promotions are given based on politics and not on leadership capability
- No work / life balance - expect to spend long hours in the office everyday, expect to get your plans dropped because an in prompt meeting was set, expect to ask for forgiveness if you take vacation days
- Very competitive work environment - people would do ANYTHING even ilegal things for a promotion, sharks will be waiting for an opportunity to throw you under the bus
- Salary is not great
- Very Hierarchical culture - you will not be able to make any decision in the business  
- Micro management -decisions even the easiest ones like more gold less yellow in a secondary font for a carton will take a lot of meetings until a decision is made
- Racism - expect to be discriminated based on your origin and race, employees are not treated with respect
- Huge employee turnover - at all management levels (from Brand President to Assistant Managers)
- Promotion and rewards are not based on performance or facts but rather politics.
- A lot of work under pressure - because decisions were pushed to the very last minute, you will have your manager on your neck once the decision is made to finish things off
- Little to no training (formal or informal) - you are expected to figure everything out from day one 
- Lack of IT systems-  you end up managing a really large business on excel spreadsheets
Advice: None
Pros: - Beauty business is great, you get a lot of free product and the Xmas party is glamorous. They brought Sarah Jessica Parker
- Amazing brands to work on
- You will always be busy
- You really learn the business
- Management is very knowledgeable of the business
- Attention to the minimum detail
- Very challenging projects
- Great products
- Great name in the resume

Cons: Compensation doesn't seem the best
Sometimes things get too political instead of purely business oriented decisions
Sometimes good practices implemented get lost as the culture is not very process oriented
Advice: Many good talents sometimes leave the company due to the not so competitive compensation, company has to be profitable but being just a little bit more competitive would help keep most of them
Pros: Potential to grow with smart, consistent, hard work
International cultural experience, even if you don't leaving your country, working with expats gives you a different vision
Some great leaders to learn from

Cons: Safety hazards and concocting issues, very high TURN over rate. Lack of communication or RESPECT from upper management. Maintenance not been done properly. PoE not being given. Favoritism as well as impartiality. And no open door policy,at all.
Advice: Communication, equality. Safety walks all day, housekeeping. Termination with out proper cause. Slip and trip hazards. Over working associates due to high TURN over rate.
Pros: Clean enviroment, limited hours worked discounts on merchandise team envisioned, and motivated, and work as a team demonstrating equality and diversity. They don't just stand around during down time,  they are cleaning or helping out others.

Cons: The company which is said to uphold  integrity, respect and ethics. I think it only happen to the higher management to do what they feel and they want. There’s no fairness in ethics, they just cover for the management in any case, no justices. Seriously, feel so sad for the company. Whoever that managed to stay or leave have the same sentiment. 
Never heard of such bad reviews from everyone, people in the company don’t even dare to voice out. They’re worried about the consequences the company or superior will act on.
Advice: Hope the TOP management seriously look into such management style. Nobody will work and stay Long in a company that do not have a equality, ethics and humanities company.
Pros: Big mnc company, dream place for people to work.

Cons: - Overworked and poor work/life balance. High attrition rate. Even before the pandemic, you can feel that everyone just wants to survive the week. Sadly, you will even have to worry about urgent issues or problems to fix on weekends. The pandemic made it worse but the high-stress environment has always been there. You will most likely see employees ranting out on Instagram/Facebook that they just want the week to be over. But it’s a cycle and it seems to never end.
- Long working hours. Pre-pandemic you will see employees working in the office until evening. You will feel ashamed of leaving early because your colleagues are still in the office even after dinner time. You will realize that the compensation and benefits such as 'Freedom Friday' are just to compensate for your overtime every day.
- No investment in modern tools/apps and process efficiency. It seems people are stuck with Excel to do most of their work. This is a problem because employees spend a lot of time and energy on manual processes and execution, and no one wants to initiate change because everyone is just too tired already just to finish their tasks. 
- Managers are all smart and great individual contributors, but I think too young or still need maturity in managing direct reports. Those are different yet equally important skill sets.
- The ‘too much friendly’ culture can be a problem in the workplace also. Because everyone is your friend, everything becomes urgent and people work by asking for favors and considerations all the time. Sadly it becomes toxic because it seems your life will revolve around L’Oreal and you will not have a personal space/time outside L’Oreal. Not to mention the gossipy culture evident in L'Oreal PH.
Advice: Please accept that people are overworked and there is poor work/life balance. Be an example of changing this culture by setting realistic deadlines and a manageable workload. Keep up with the modern times on improving efficiency and how we work.
Pros: - Compensation and benefits, generous allowances on top of monthly salary
- Free products at company events and employee discounts
- People are all nice and willing to help each other get through the week
- Sustainability efforts on all of its brands
- Once a month half day off
- Great established global brand, sadly not so much as a workplace when you are already inside the company. They say L'Oreal works like a start-up, but it operates on a bigger scale being an established brand, which makes it chaotic.
- Growth and fast career advancement, but only if you are willing to sell your soul to the company

Cons: They create positions for people who are already high up just for the sake of it and the title without them actually being a true asset to deserve that position in the company
Advice: Promote people who actually deserve it and instead of asking more from your Beauty Assistants and Makeup Artists ,  ask the regionals and national makeup artists to put more effort towards taking the business further.
Pros: •Some good benefits ( staffshop , commission , hamper bags) 
•My team in the stores I’ve been has always been great.

Cons: Be prepared to work 12-15 hour days. Know that you will be penalized for starting or having a family as you will not advance. If you don't "play the L'Oreal game" you will be forced out and professional integrity will be slandered throughout all levels of the company. You can never trust HR, they will always side with upper management (your voice will never be heard & you will be penalized for voicing your concerns). Turn over is very high and if your not in Marketing, there is no career path or support for advancement.
Advice: 
Pros: Looks good on a resume as most companies will know how much loyalty, determination and personal/professional strength it takes to stay with a company such as L'Oreal. Benefits are great but at what sacrifice?

Cons: Very few processes, bad work life balance, unrealistic demands from senior management
Advice: We say we are consumer centric but much of what we do currently is not. People are too focused on their own career progression by delivering one or two great projects and not focused enough on doing a good job overall. People are often promoted too quickly and so there is often a skills gap at senior management level.
Pros: Very few processes, very talented people, agile working scheme

Cons: - Only the strong survive. It's either you're there for less than 2 years, or more than 5 years.
- Everyone is out for themselves.
- Very French mentality and culture
Advice: Ask your employees what they need to have a more enjoyable work environment, and actually do things to make it happen.
Pros: - They give you the opportunity to run a multi million dollar brand at a very young age.
- You are exposed to the day-to-day struggles of running your own business
- They put you in a position to be able to leave and have the fundamentals to start your own company.

Cons: The culture is so trong you realize that is highly unhealthy and toxic for young people to grow as young professionnals. They will teach you the L'Oreal way, which will make you a very good profesionnals. But you will also have a compltemy biais vision of what it takes to be good. It is not made for everybody. When you realize that sometimes is too late.
Advice: People are not assets you can play with.
Pros: Strong culture, feels like you "belong somewhere" when you are young. 
Possibilities are endlress (if you are ready to pay the price for it...)

Cons: it's sweatshop - you will be doing the job of 4-5 people at the same position in the Western European subsidiary, HUGE turnover (abou 20%\)
Advice: there should be the same approach towards employees across the company in the different countries - the offices comfort is not the same, the workload is not the same, very few locals (not to say "no at all" in the management comittee), no credible intelligent HR directors.
Pros: it's international company and have such employer in the 3d world country is greatest advantage

Cons: If you want to be successful, you will work hard. The hours aren't crazy but don't expect to get everything done in 9-5.
Lack of process/structure is challenging at times, you have to know lots of people to get things done and often have to ask forgiveness rather than permission. This could also sit in the PROs too!
Advice: More interconnectivity between countries would be really smart. Particularly for corporate functions.
Pros: Lot's of responsibility and autonomy, freedom to be entrepreneurial.

Flexible working for all staff in the UK is amazing.

Cons: Not as many as the pros, but it can feel a bit bureaucratic, a lot of documentation. The workload can be overwhelming sometimes and there is a lot of pressure from all the stakeholders. Unfortunately the salaries are not great either.
Advice: Try harder to retain the good people!
Pros: Working at L'Oreal will find you in a great environment, very diverse with numerous nationalities. There are opportunities to move in the company and generally a lot of trainings and tools to develop. It feels like you are heard as an employee and your opinion matters.

Cons: Lack of opportunities to a permanent position in despatch leaving a great number of agency workers who've been working there for years in a situation of precarity with no benefits or career development prospects,
Some managers and supervisors can be quite arrogant, 
Constant performance expectations and reviews with a somewhat innacurate percentage based system resulting in a general sentiment of discontent and lack of morale.
Advice: Creating more opportunities for agency workers to a permanent position.
Pros: Good amount of hours (37.5 weekly),
Decent training provided,
Overall safe and tidy facilities,
Ongoing somewhat secure work.

Cons: The work ethos can be overwhelming, they're notorious for working incredibly hard but this can sometimes lead to staying in the office until 8pm, merely because the rest of your team is.
Advice: Set a better example of healthy working ours, everyone should work at their own pace and on their own terms - sometimes this can get lost due to teams working incredibly long hours, which then gets filtered down as something that's expected of you.
Pros: They really take care of their employees and your mental wellbeing within the company.

Cons: - swim or sink attitute - you have to find your way and do it quickly
- your career really depends on who you know - strong networking skills are a must
- "We are looking after our staff" is not their motto
Advice: Please value your people more
Pros: - people are L'Oreal's everything: talented, charismatic, bubbly and creative
- it is fun to work and fun to party
- enterpreneurial spirit is very strong
- fantastic products to work with
- realtively easy to explore international career opportunities

Cons: I felt it was unsupportive working environment. I would describe it as dog eat dog type of place.
Work / Life balance was not something I did enjoy and as a result I was feeling depressed and lethargic. I felt that the processes and systems were unnecessarily cumbersome and manual.
I felt like a cog in a wheel, totally expandable - replaceable in a heartbeat. Pay-wise its not a very generous employer, given the expectations of staff.
For me personally it was not a time well spent working there and I will look back at this company as the bad mistake I have made in selecting a workplace.
Advice: Look after your staff
Pros: I honestly could did not see any pros working there

Cons: Old school management (incl. top management).
Toxic atmosphere (high pressure, big turnover of the teams, can't trust HR and managers).
Most of managers are there since years and are being promoted not for their competencies but thanks to politics games. All good elements resign after a few weeks/months.
The company in Australia is getting bad results year after year (i.e. the global sharing is at its minimum since couple of years). However, the staff/management responsible for this poor performance is still being promoted to the top position.
Advice: Bring more Ethics and get rid of the useless managers.
Pros: International company.
Nice location.
If you're good in networking, then you can be promoted very quickly (no matter if you perform well or not in your job).
Staff shop.

Cons: The culture can be somewhat chaotic and unstructured which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but takes time to get used to and learn what's going on (not really any sufficient training materials). The pay is also not great for interns (especially given the cost of living in London!).
Advice: None
Pros: Working at L'Oreal can be really enjoyable. The people are generally really outgoing and fun. You can get exposure to life at a top firm with a diverse range of products and processes. The staff shop is also a real bonus!

Cons: Perks did not outweigh the cons: lack of ability to progress into different areas, no encouragement or support from senior members of staff. They seem to only retain employees who are either cut-throat or want to stay in the same position. No reward or attention to those who are improving product sales, work hard and/or show great passion for the brand/company. Office politics makes for a tricky working environment.
Advice: I'm afraid there isn't much point....
Pros: Gained a lot of insider beauty industry experience.

Cons: Not a place for staying in comfort zone or people without entrepreneur spirit
Needs more structure and be more focused on "fewer &better"
There are lots of work-life balance for many people, yet some  lacks it
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of space to take initiatives, gives you freedom to implement your own ideas, Great place if you have potential to grow and you'll have opportunities to stretch yourself - regardless of your age
Dynamic, fast, smart in sensing and acting with entrepreneurship
Focuses so much on sense of purpose and the business itself is about "beauty"
Nice people

Cons: To corporate / hierarchical and to structured. Entrepreneurship is not stimulated enough. Most people are really young within L'Oreal. Company needs more diversity: more older people / more man / more people from a different education background.
Advice: Need more diversity in teams. L'Oreal recruits way to many interns to many  or people from student associations. Recommendation is to look more outside the company.
Pros: L'Oreal invest a lot in people. Especially in education. Also the option to develop yourself in the company or to switch a job internally is definitely an advantage.
Working hours are perfect within L'Oreal.

Cons: The politics. a lot of big egos (and a lot of denying there are big egos).  A lot of talk about career progression when actually and staying in a role for 2 years when actually this is only a rule for some when they need it.  It came across that meaningful progression really was only available to those who were part of the management scheme
Advice: None
Pros: The people there are fantastic, everyone is very passionate about what they're doing and really focused and driven on getting things done

Cons: Career development can be improved. Mostly left to the manager so it really depends on who you get.
Advice: Make sure that employees have an ongoing and transparent discussion about their career progression with their manager and HR. Implement 360 evaluation (evaluation by manager, employees and collaborators)
Pros: Working at l'Oréal is a bit like working at a global startup. Their commitment for enabling entrepreneurship is real. And it's a bit like being at a university, tons of young and motivated people. Inspiring vibe and constant exposure to new ideas

Cons: While state management is really friendly and easy to approach, I found there was often a huge lack of communication and a lot of disorganization. Some of the managers had almost too much of a laid back attitude and there was sometimes a blurr between social &amp; business relationships. The counters can sometimes go for months without resources such as testers/samples with no explanation and it can be frowned upon for you to follow up yourself. If you have a permanent position higher management will generally look out for you a bit more but I found that casuals were often forgotten about/left in the dark about their hours/shifts. There were many times where there were problems with the roster and a few issues with payroll which could be very frustrating. The 'OneLuxe' approach is great in theory and did create a lot of support between the different teams within stores; however, it's way too much work for the state managers to handle on their own and  I think that's where the discrepancies in organisation and lack of communication came from.
Advice: State management shouldn't have to look after more than 2 brands otherwise it gets to be way too much for them and the employees and counters suffer because of it.
Pros: L'Oreal offers an excellent social aspect and a lot of quality training and experience in sales. The job perks are wonderful with free products and the management team is really friendly and easy to approach. If you are working here while studying its an excellent job, however, if you do want to pursue a career in beauty or management there are a lot of opportunities and room for progression. They also work hard to recognise staff achievements and the in-store events can be really fun when they are successful.

Cons: 1. Career Development Plan is not set for many, poor milestones which makes you lost , depends more on the opportunities raised (reactive) rather than creating ones (proactive).
2. Salary package is poor, the curve is decreasing make it less competitive to others.
Advice: Work more on the career development for employees and the salary package and benefits after benchmarking with others.
Pros: 1. Career Development in a very flexible environment. Company promotes change of positions despite background. which increases the learning curve.
2. Clear vision and strategy on the corporate level which helps to make things clear and promotes alignment.
3. Learning.

Cons: - poor balance between professional and personal life
- below-average salaries
- high turnover of staff
- no compensation for extra hours
- lack of respect toward young professionals by the company (indicating there's always a line of candidates willing to do your job at the threshold of the company)
Advice: - More timely communication to employees to improve efficiency.
Pros: - real responsibility from day 1
- interesting field of work, diverse social events with colleagues and customers
- very educational for recent graduates
- appreciated by future employers
- profit sharing system

Cons: They lack work/ life balance. Poor management in some departments with lack of insight into business knowledge, lack of direction and accountability.  Fast turnaround in some departments and Sr Mgmt lacks ability to retain talented employees.
Advice: Sr Management needs to recognize employee efforts and utilize resources more efficiently.  Create better processes so that projects are not suddenly dropped on employee last minute.  Improve work/life balance.
Pros: learning large corporate culture
employee discounts and free goods on product
employees are friendly and enjoyable to work with
brand new office building
fast pace organization

Cons: Very low retention of Talents coming from external companies. The company is ready to pay the high price to attract them, but sometimes HR don't know how to motivate and keep them.

I felt like there is a gap between the values and the ethic codes written everywhere and the actual behavior of some people in the company - especially HR Directors. 

A lot of processes and waste of time on projects and basically pretty much everything. Some people work more to serve their strive for power and fulfill their work ambition rather to actually serve the interest of the brands or the company itself. 

Being polite is all about being considerate and appreciative, but for many people, it remains a challenge.
Advice: I very highly encourage top management to be more empathetic and act with more generosity when dealing with people. Sometimes it's only a matter of basic rules of life about politeness.

I also encourage the top managment to place all their employees - from the sales associate from the stores to the head office directors, at the heart of their company values. Even though the HR are claiming out loud equality and so on, in reality we are still far from it. 

And please do not judge others, don't be the first to throw the stone, even if you have higher education it doesn't mean you can't learn from someone with less education.
Pros: Great salary and benefits, working with intellectually stimulating and international people. Everything is done to make you believe you are part of the Elite when you work at l'Oréal.

Amazing projects to work on and real budget behind it to realize it, a lot of new products launched all the time. 

Great Learning & Development policy and programs to keep developing the employees. Also some conferences on diverse subjects to really keep you thinking out-of-the box.

Cons: A lot of old school marketing people. New ideas in marketing are rare and success of the company is insecure, as not whole management is developing. Too much depending on France and brand thinking.
Advice: Accept change and not live it as phrases. Understand what brand building will be in the future and push for new ideas.
Pros: Entreuprenial thinking, responsibility and Great Marketing. You have the chance to decide and execute own ideas pretty quickly, even if you are new. If you can convince management and they buy in. Great brands and good growth!

Cons: Whole system is in one big chaos, it doesn’t matter where you work. The base is just chaos. Also totally disrespect of people needs, with really low wages cokparing to the other companies. Not valuing people (menthors) whom, after a while, leave company and use Loreal as a jumping board toward next position
Advice: None
Pros: Good thing is the brands you are working on. Also, possibility to progress in career (depending on how good you can do politics with right people. Also, in every company there is politics, but here is just much more.

Cons: The work/life balance has always been (and continues to be) an issue - unrealistic expectations in terms of deliverables, and endless rework and revalidation mean that things take far longer than they should. It is also a very political environment, with a lot of paranoia amongst managers - especially at a senior level.
Advice: None
Pros: The company has some great brands and there is a lot of energy in the place. The company is also very good at fitting your career path to your individual interests and strengths,

Cons: -hands-off training style, very sink-or-swim attitude 
-poor communication all-around; you spend more time in meetings getting people on the same page than accomplishing actual work/making decisions
-company culture can be rather off-putting
Advice: -improve coordination/communication between various departments
-encourage more innovative/out-of-the-box styles of leadership/idea generation
Pros: -lots of opportunity for upward movement, as well as movement across different divisions and brands
-solid benefits package and perks (early release on Fridays in the summer, $75 free goods bi-monthly, etc)

Cons: Be prepared for long (uncompensated) working days, ad ho deadlines, shfting priorities, conflicting instructions from managers and an elbow culture. There´s not much teamspirit, everyone is just focused on their own job and career.
Advice: Care more about the employees. Give them propoer training and hire more staff so employees do not continuously work overhours to tackel the workload.
Pros: If you want a creative and challenging job with lots of responsibilty and fast advancement opportunities, this is the place to work for you.

Cons: Crazy working hours and zero to no work life balance, employee viewed as a mere number and not person, hr very much a siloed function with junior staff not getting a lot of support
Advice: better work life balance needed, mentor system should be set up. more secondment options, junior members need to see a work life balance structure in place so they could see themselves growing with the company
Pros: excellent training, inspirational peers and seniors, marketing excellence, ownership and accountability, good benefits and good location compared with other FMCG businesses, good career progression

Cons: CYA enviroment.
Upper Management often looks out for themselves and doesnt try to develop the majority of talent.

High turnover, long hours and pay is below market equivalents.HR has as large say in career succession and is very disorganized.
Advice: Invest in your people and look out for their best interests.
Pros: you work with great people in a young and dynamic environment. A place where you will make good contacts in different cities should you choose to stay in the FMCG industry when you choose to leave.

Cons: Bad atmosphere in some luxury brands, difficulty to communicate with the hierarchy, extremely vertical organisation. Very stressful environment but it can also be considered as an advantage to learn and go beyond your limits.
Advice: Stop the useless meetings, it is not always welcome to make a "point" on Monday AND wednesday AND Friday whereas you could have solved it way better by yourself.
Pros: Great salary and good training, there is a competition that allows you to give the best of what you can do.

Cons: Poor Management 
Very Less employee incentives
Advice: Candidate considered for managerial position should have leader ship qualities. In loreal, a candidate deems fit for managerial position based on his seniority and experience - regardless of the fact that whether he or she can lead/manage team or not.

Secondly, Employee's are more important than customers/consumers.
Pros: Work Delegation - Managers delegate most of their tasks to their Juniors. Helping them grow faster
Experience - beside learning one's work, new starters or mid level employees are exposed to higher management which helps them become more confident and grow.

Cons: Forever feel as if we are preparing for an international visitor! Australia is not a valued market.
Advice: None
Pros: A business that is forever evolving, no 2 days are the same so if you are resilient, passionate and ready to work hard then L'Oreal is a great place. Success is part of the culture, but more so in recent years the how we win is just as important. L'Oreal places allot of value on it's people and you as an employee feel as if you can make a difference.

Cons: When you go to training they say its a ethical company but when you work in the sales. They want numbers anyhow. If you are working according to systems you wont be promoted but if know bootlicking and can do sales by even wrong means.you will b promoted.
Advice: U r carrying a huge brand name atleast take care of that. Sales doesnt mean you can do it unethically. U r loosing talent and market share because of this only.

Cons: Lots of admin work for finance manager level, too many financial forecasts with tight deadlines throughout the year, lots of overtime, compliance is sometimes too loose, in general chaotic working experience between functions

Cons: Long hours, Traditional Office Politics
Advice: As the company has grown over the past decade, the "red tape" is without a doubt getting thicker and thicker. I would suggest taking a look at efficiencies of current processes and mechanisms and how productivity could be increased with reduced "red tape."
Pros: L'oreal gives you more responsibility than most companies do--usually experience that at most companies you would not get until at a director or VP level--If you can do well in your role you get promoted very quickly

Cons: - no respect for employees
- not transparant at all
- political influenced
- atmosphere is not positive at all.. as if people were masks all the time
- no structure and ineffective work methods
- degrees seem to be mor important then talent or drive
Advice: Degrees are not the main issue to hire / promote people. It is in fact one of the few companies were I saw super motivated people when they entered the company but disgust after a year
Pros: - cool products
- excellence in visual communication
- goodlooking people

Cons: I sometimes feel that they lack manpower as they have limited working space and thus, only able to accommodate the few. Yet, it's still a great place to work and learn from experienced people.
Advice: Don't exactly have any advise as I find the leadership and working condition pretty good. Except maybe, increase in manpower.
Pros: You will be able to meet people from diverse cultures and background. For girls, this may just be the dream land as it has everything to do with being beautiful and presentable.

Cons: Very flshy, takes things on face value, highly perception driven, takes decision based on "Who" aspect rather than "what", top management in India not very capable,
Advice: Takes some good people in Country top management from outside. Devise mechanism to identify talent instead of going by perception, takes decision based on merit of the case and not by who has done it
Pros: Very open and vibrant culture, truly democratic in decisionmaking, not much office politics, senior management very respectful to juniors, efficient middle management

Cons: A sink or swim environment, not much training on the products, long hours, not having the right or old tools in place.

Pros: The L'Oreal brand has great product allowance, amazing incentives plus a great sales commissions.
Have friends for life as we had a great field team.

Advice: None
Pros: I would recommend L'Oréal to any of my friends who are not afraid of challenges and want to work with incredible passionate people! L'Oréal is a great school to learn from the best in the industry while developing yourself further each and every day. There is an individual training plan created for you each year!

Cons: Bad Management, brand leaders always makes you down by keeping their low ideas. Thinking about a day you're senior staff but your new brand leader tell you that "it's my brand my money, don't say no to me". 
No traning no oversea meeting, no development plan over the past 2 years.
Advice: Please check your brand leaders again, they are the reason that we - senior staffs leave company
Pros: Inspiring luxury brands to work for. You can learn brand story and adapt to your lifestyle. Flexible working time

Pros: Great trainings, promotions in place if you work for it

Cons: Salary is low compared to the workload, and it almost doesn't change every year regardless of how well you perform. Middle management can be smart individuals, but doesn't mean they are able to lead a team.

Cons: Cant get anything done, its a French company so everything is run from France, Department structures are stuck in the past.

Advice: None
Pros: Some nice people , no one really checks what you are doing

Cons: Some managers really shouldn't be managers. Unethical, leaking confidential, and often untrue information about employees to their peers. Hypocritical and also 
Managers also seem to be of the habit of making their team do most of the work, yet claiming the credit. They aren't transparent and I get the sense that they deliberately set the employees they don't like up to fail.

Pros: Great Boot Camp for Marketing. Other functions like PR, Finance, Operations look elsewhere. These departments are low on the pecking order. It's all about Sales and Marketing here.

The company is truly serious in producing high quality products, very reliable.

Highly disorganised, seems like it is in the company DNA
There is no culture of being good at your work and efficient it is all about showing your passion and staying endless hours at your desk and working all the time then you get promoted even if you are bad

Pros: good ambiance and workplace. Nice place to explore your self and stretch your expertise.

Cons: Over-rated as a global multi, I've worked for other multi-nationals and L'Oteal attracts and retains a poor talent pool because of the way they treat employees. If you have low self esteem or are a desperate grad, join them. The previous comments of bullying within from management is completely true. The comments re: a "high performance" culture reflects the fact senior people justify their incompetence by pushing those who work in field, on counter, as customer facing or in subservient positions.
Advice: Overpaid ex-pats are a waste/mistake as are overpaid politicians. Australia has a place in the global market so stop treating it with disrespect.

Cons: no job offer, even though I got excellent feedback on my work, but have been told that they do not have any vacancies at the moment

Pros: Great benefits, early Fridays, work from home twice a month, mat leave top-up, discounts on products, working in the downtown core

Cons: Lack of career opportunities (small subsidiary), work-life balance doesn't happen for some people, depending on position. Compensation is average, could be better.

MY ADVISE DO NOT WORK HERE UNLESS YOU WANT NO LIFE AND TO BE MADE TO FEEL UNAPPRECIATED

reason.
Pros: -Lower management knows about life/work balance.
-Good quarterly bonuses.
-Free goods twice a year.
-If you are a recent graduate from college you are golden.

Cons: Worst work life balance. 9 - 5 job? I've never done those hours the whole time I've been there. You will be there until 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or even midnight. And even then you will go home and work more. Those hours are expected. Even if you leave at 6, it will be noticed and asked why you are leaving early. Meetings are regularly scheduled after 'work' hours. Say goodbye to having dinner with friends and family. Say goodbye to your life.  

Worst culture. A boys club. Yes in a beauty company. It's as if as a female you have no opinion, your ideas are wrong, you are looked down on. 

Worst planning. Everything was due yesterday. No concept of prioritising. Everything is now, now, now. There's no planning out beyond the current season. It's reactive, not proactive. 

Worst development. Zero focus on development plans or training. You will be promised it but it will never happen. You won't get any feedback on your performance until the end of year review. And trust me, shocks will hit you in the face at your review. I've seen barely any promotions unless you are well liked, not if the person is ready. 

Worst turnover. Rumoured to be 75%. I think it's higher. It's a never ending revolving door. No stability. No getting to know your team. Constant upheaval. 

Worst hiring of local talent. A lot of talent is brought in from international locations. I wouldn't call them talent really. I regularly see international people here to work in Australia hired over locals and L'Oreal getting these people visas. 

Worst management. No clear direction. No vision. No sharing of objectives and results. No team activities. Any managers that allow all these things to happen are not worth working for.

Worst place to work. Don't do it. You think you will be working for a big company with great brands. You will regret it. Trust me. You will want to walk out constantly. Trust me.
Advice: Test others how you want to be treated. Treat your employees like humans. Offer encouragement and advice. Celebrate wins. Be human.
Pros: Big company that looks good on your resume. Only because it is a well known fact that if you can last a year at L'Oreal you can do anything.

Cons: Political culture - management values a very specific type of people. People tend not to make rational decisions and are instead motivated by emotions, without focusing on driving business.

Pros: Reputable brands, wide scope for young people to learn from

Cons: Everything happens in a very "organic" way... i.e., desorganised. Average age is very low so there is a lot of inexperience, stress and wasted energy.

Cons: Can take some time to adapt since innovative and flexible structure can lend itself to a complex organization
Advice: Networking and entrepreneurship is key.
Pros: The integration programs for new-to-L'Oreal employees are well thought out and relevant.

Cons: Good Processes but ghastly execution. 
Lack of transparency. 
Too much politics/ Lack of meritocracy - the best person for the job might not always get it.

Cons: Please, do not be bamboozled and fooled by the company propaganda plastered all over linkedin and career sites of the fake utopia they want you to believe in. Before accepting this internship at the DMI (Direct Marketing International) in Paris I was warned by professors that they dealt with students being exploited and worked like a slave - I should have listened they were right. If you are reading this I highly advise to work for another company in France. I have 10+ years work experience. I took this internship because I am a foreigner and it was apart of my masters to have an internship and complete it to graduate.   This is by far the worse job I have ever had in my 10 years working as an adult. Interns are exploited at this company. I came to France for better work life balance - haha I should have run away as soon as I got this offer. Plan on leaving the office at 7/8pm - and if you work from home, good luck they will abuse you like an animal. I was told as well as other interns to LIE on our time sheets about the amount of hours we worked because apparently they had a scandal a few years ago about over working interns - I AM HERE TO TELL YOU IT’S STILL HAPPENING and even during a pandemic. Everyone knows we work well past our contract hours - now we are just told to lie about it and WORK IN SECRET. Managers will play a psychological game to save their reputation to HR. They will tell you to go home in person with smiles and concern but in reality you know you cannot because they pushed 5 hours of work on you at 5pm so you end up either staying late at the office or taking your laptop home to finish. My contract said 35 hours, I was easily working 60 - 80 hours a week and sometimes finishing work on the weekend. You try and keep up with the endless demands of managers who will have you redo the same powerpoint 27 times (I am not over exaggerating this is how many times I reworked a powerpoint once that was just used for an internal meeting). The company culture is very hierarchical if you have a lower position you will be ignored or talked down to or most likely not even listened to.   I feel the company is getting away with abusing interns because most of the interns are young and do not have any previous work experience. Also no one reports the bad behavior because they are relying on their manager to recommend them in order to get hired. When I tried to speak up and say something to HR I was ignored and brushed aside and told to speak transparently with my manager who was regularly condescending, her constructive criticism on a powerpoint presentation I completed with another intern was “the beginning is pretty and the end is getting shitter and shitter.” Let’s just say she made the Devil Wears Prada look like a nice person.   Working here is only worth your time if you have an upper management position in this company. Working as an intern you are paid 1200 (1400 but 200 is taken out every month for taxes) and as a junior if you do get hired you will be getting paid 2200 per month and barley scraping by in Paris while you give your entire life to a company that doesn’t appreciate you - I wouldn’t recommend it. Also they will try and entice you to stay for 5 years because at the end of 5 years you have access to shares. All of my managers worked for the company for 5+ years and its the only thing they know in their working careers - I honestly pity them because they do not know that life can be so much better.   I wanted to quit this internship and I couldn’t I had to finish it in order to validate my masters - this is how it is done here in France. The company knows this. They know they own you for 6 months and you won’t be able to get out - my recommendation is don’t start -run away while you still can.
Advice: More accountability needs to be place on managers and how they treat interns. I contacted previous interns that also worked underneath the same female manager and they all had the same experience of bullying as me.

Contrasting opinions of senior management with unclear briefs given resulting in many insignificant changes forced on by managers.

Very frustrating to work with slow paced decision makers. Difficult and embarrassing to communicate with cusomers. Constantly wasting time.

There is a lack of people management skills. Some managers lack self awareness and the impact their behaviour causes on others.

I have witnessed and experienced bullying here by Senior Managers who try to make you fit the mould. This issue is not tackled but ignored. This has led to my departure without an exit interview.

Turnover is exceptionally high at at least 70% but there it has become a joke rather than addresses.

Systems are very out of date. Many do not have access to work from home so have to come into the office at weekends.

Lots of wasted money in the wrong areas yet not enough spent to motivate their people. Lots of out of pocket expenses when travelling.
Advice: Review business structure and ensure you have the correct people managers in place which can drive strategies without abusing their power of authority.

Feedback is 2 way and should be engaged across all levels of the business to get the best result first time.

Provide people management training. Tackle bullying head on. Managers are not motivating their teams and fuelling constant churn of employees. How you treat others is a reflection of yourself and the business.
Pros: Working with Innovative, international brands makes the sell much easier.
Also easy to get passionate about the products.
Generous discounts and samples.
Looks great on your resume.
Regular intake of grads and interns.
Lots of internal promotions particularly in Marketing.

Cons: Working overtime especially in supply chain department, still being payed without bonus, plus senior management is not appreciating your long lasting work
Advice: Senior management should employ more humanistic managers to handle also people not just work overload. Missing that part will harm the valuable employees of this company
Pros: International travel opportunity once a year to every employees from bottom to the top is the best thing at this company

Cons: non flexible work hours, limited room for career progression, no salary review or pay increases, limited benefits, hours worked monitored, decisions delayed as a result of too many cooks
Advice: staff moral is important and review of benefits, career progression, up-skilling should be considered more strongly, limited mentoring

Cons: No career plan, little career development, innapropiate/unprofessional comments from management, no guidance and overall attitude of "that's the way L'Oréal has always done things, you can't change it"
Advice: Look out for ALL employees, HR has a terrible reputation in my country. Invest in talent with courses and take a look at your leadership positions. I have never been in such an unprofessional environment.
Pros: Huge company, good salary and personal benefits

Cons: No worklife balance and you won't have time and mood to enjoy any of the company event. 

Workload is massive and people don't care and recognise your effort being put inside your work. Very depressing!
Advice: Worklife balance is a big topic for this company to improve!!
Pros: As an employee, you will receive a lot of freegoods and products. Company will organise a lot of interesting events for their employees.

Cons: It exists a huge Gap between Managers from L'oreal PT when compared with other FMCG in Portugal. They lack on management and HR skills, very  authoritarian environment with few chances of carreer progress for the below HR levels. No rotation between Internal structure and no outside recruitment for Midlle management.
Consequence: Old Managers using always the same formula of managemen and very demanding and authoritary. Or, very unexperient expatriat that are promoted to Directors levels, managing teams of PM with more experience then them, creating a very bad environment and lack of credibility doing business.
The average stay for new commers in MKTG is 2 years maximum, because of the bad pressure of the managers near levels below, to do things quick with lack of resources, bad salaries and exploiting at maximum, the new trainnes and recent product managers, with hours and hours of administrative/mecanic work, and no strategy or whatsoever.
No respect for the operational colaborators, neither Product managers. The mentality is that PM are priviledge to work there, even in extreme bad conditions of authoritarian environment. No room for autonomy and meritocracy. I dont recomend L'oreal Portugal to work on, at all.
Advice: For Managers: Get a life, besides work, and let other have it too! 
I dont believe the company will ever figure how to be a Great place to work. Learn with the competition, and learn to be open minded, hearing everyone in the company: from the lady that cleans toilets to the recent trainnee just arrived, because everyone deserves 1st respect and the benefict of doubth that it has some inteligence. Thats DIVERSITY, and that's what enriches the companies... diversity blend.
Pros: The proximity with Innovative products only.
Quick way of getting a good idea of how the market works, how the company thinks, and the dinamic of each segment on the cosmetic field.
Very glamorous world, only on the advertising. No such glamour on a daily basis, but very hard work, with no balance in the quality life.

Cons: l'oreal usa tends to work its middle management hard - work/life balance is hard to maintain due to the expectations of middle managers (especially production)
Advice: provide more live feedback regarding individual performance to management - a lot is encouraged for hourly folks; same expectation should be given to management.

Pros: - People

A new culture is being adopted "Simplicity", a great opportunity for change.

Cons: - Horrifying management: one's leadership is hardly taken into account during promotion, thus creating many junior employees with 0 leadership and manipulative personalities ending up in the management. Language abusive & workplace bullying are sadly too common.
- Politics: sometimes promotion depends solely on what relation you have with the big guy.
- Gossip: everyone speaks ill of everyone behind everyone's back. Way to encourage trust and teamwork!
- Inexistent work-life balance: 60 to 80 working hours per week.
Advice: Provide psychological counselling to the constant cases of mental breakdown.
Pros: - Career opportunities
- Interesting projects
- Decent salary for marketing position
- Big name to put on cv

Cons: Design decisions are highly constrained. Input is limited. Initiative is discouraged. Business people with little to no understanding of programming try to dictate design decisions. Consultants who remain either prove their worth as data analysts or codge together haphazard code to meet some supposedly urgent  and poorly thought out requirement.

Consultants are definitely not "part of the family". They are unable to participate in company-sponsored volunteer programs. Their children cannot participate in the "Bring Your Daughter/Son to Work" day and are not eligible for scholarship programs. On the other hand, they are expected to give the "face-time" and keep the hours of a clock-punching regular employee. Consultants should consider whether parenting responsibilities and traffic to one of L'Oreal's inconvenient locations will cause them to arrive at the office after 9 am, since such "late" arrivals will count against them, regardless of any compensating late hours or weekends working at home. Working away from the office is discouraged and long hours spent on major changes will not be compensated; you will be told to reduce the hours you are claiming for the month.

Their pay on a corp-to-corp would be barely tolerable on a W-2. That rate is never increased, even after years working for L'Oreal as a consultant.  Also, consultants are paid monthly for the previous month's work, usually after the 15th. Payment processing occurs in several steps, each of which is done by a separate individual or group on their appointed day of the week. If that appointed day is a company holiday -- or some other excuse -- then the checks are delayed for another week. Consultants are advised to work through a consultancy primarily serving contracts with companies making more punctual payments than L'Oreal.
Advice: Stop the charade and hire your technical staff at full-time, permanent positions. You may have to spend more for timely payroll, benefits and raises, but you will not be needlessly angering your workers. You will also be giving your technical staff the authority they need in order to properly design your computer systems.

Then you should seriously consider letting programmers work from home, with only an occasional meeting, or group of meetings, to hash over design issues. Without the clock being used as a measure of work, programmers can be free to solve problems in the most efficient manner: awaking themselves in the middle of the night when they finally figured out what was causing that bug and immediately coding the fix.
Pros: Discount at the Company Store

Cons: The downsides of the company was no good facilities of salary.
Advice: None

People feel so proud to be part of the company as company provides full support o their employeee in professional front.

Pros: Strong flexibility and entrepreneurial spirit with well built career path. Digital step up in day to day work to keep up with trends.

International and dynamic environment

Cons: This company is not for everyone. If you can handle hard pressure from an organized chaos, then thumbs up!
Advice: None
Pros: The best thing to work at L'Oreal is that you have space to initiate, speak out and realize your idea. Also to work on out of scope projects which will enhance your knowledge and abilities to switch to others positions in the future.

Cons: -the new CEO Hieronimus is well known for being extremely tough. It’s a huge step backward for the company as it has strived for years to improve its reputation and external image. 
Career paths are random for the most part: they remain extremely unclear and down to the people you meet and work with. If you end up working on the wrong brand or in the wrong division, you will get stuck and have a slow progression with endless parallel moves that will degrade your curriculum. HR’s do not even hide the fact that each career at L’oreal is highly singular: in other words, it’s down to plain luck. Those that emerge are not the most talented ones but those who were lucky enough to work with influential people who over the years worked their way up the corporate ladder. The so called meritocracy that the company often boasts is a complete lure.
Don’t expect a progressive stance on home office either: at best employees will get 2 days of home office whereas most corporations have taken the leap and now let their employees work 100% from home if they wish.
Increasing positive discrimation too: if you are a mid age white male, you will struggle, however good your records are.
Terrible work life balance if you work in a local business unit or in a DMI.
Advice: Merit-based promotions leveraging 360 evaluations. 
Higher monthly salaries with much less profit sharing: when a company delivers 3,5 months of revenue in profit sharing and about 12% of variable pay you know that something is wrong with your monthly pay slip. 
Real training: E-learning is used massively to keep most employees away from proper personal development trainings. Only a handful of employees still benefit from coaching or leadership training. 
Stop simplicity: everyone knows it’s a decoy.
Pros: Most brands are good, but lots of them are also totally overlooked. Pick the right ones or end up suffering a lot with zero budget and maximum pressure to turn them around like all your predecessors who tried, failed (and left).

Strong desorganization
The result is no work life balance.
