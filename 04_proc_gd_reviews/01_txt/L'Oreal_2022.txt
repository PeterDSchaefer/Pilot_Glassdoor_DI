Cons: Health insurance is terrible, even with the highest coverage PPO plan. Costs have skyrocketed over the last couple of years the increases go well beyond any increases in salary - even with stellar performance. If there are issues with claims it takes hours on the phone over multiple sessions to get resolved. Expect to pay well above the deductible and out of pocket max since that only applies to what Anthem deems 'appropriate'.

Current employees are being compensated well below market value and there are no plans to reevaluate comp levels. Only new hires are coming in with competitive salaries and are compensated well above tenured employees.

We make a truly stunning amount of money for a very select group of people.

HR has far too much power over career mobility and the evaluation system they use to evaluate talent is opaque. If you get misclassified somewhere along the way you may not even be aware and it could take years to fix it.
Advice: Pay your people what they are worth. Go back to health plans that actually pay for health care, employees should not have to have a panic attack about how much a doctor's visit is going to cost before a visit even occurs.
Pros: You get to work alongside some of the most talented, passionate, and diverse people in the world!

L'Oreal is truly an organization that is committed to making the world a better place through all of their sustainability and DE&amp;I commitments.

Incredibly fast paced, highly competitive environment that is great for individuals that thrive with this type of energy. 

The highly matrixed environment can be a bit frustrating at times but generally creates much more powerful initiatives.

Cons: Upper management can afford to undergo some serious bias training, and any person managing anybody should undergo more extensive training on how to be a positive force for change. It can be quite easy and frustrating to get bogged down by old-school corporate politics here, when everything would be so much better if a top-down perspective was implemented to figure out what the actual issues were.
Advice: None
Pros: Promotions are relatively quick (1-2 years depending on timing, network, etc.). There are some amazing people at this company, so it's great to quickly build out one's network and I worked with some amazing people. You will learn so much from some of the most creative minds. There has been an effort to push for diversity in certain divisions.

Cons: No remote jobs. Consumers confuse L'Oreal Paris brand with L'Oreal Group, the company. We are so much more - 50 brands globally and growing. Lancôme, Kiehl's, Redken, Maybelline, Garnier, Matrix, Essie, Ralph Lauren, YSL, NYX, Urban Decay, CeraVe, SkinCeuticals, La Roche Posay, Vichy, Carol's Daughter, Mizani, SoftsheenCarson, Kerastase, Valentino, Prada....
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible, hybrid work schedule, creative, innovative, inclusive, top of the industry, global, Fortune 500, consumer centric, speed to promotion, internal rotations, career advancement, mentor &amp; coaching environment, products, ethics, sustainable, caring, fast, speed to market, science at the core, diverse, affinity groups, open minded, constantly changing, best in class, growing, pension &amp; 401(k), great benefits, free product, name recognition, big budgets, global appeal, pay for performance, rewarding, philanthropic, leader in human rights and equality...

Cons: The job itself is too much for one person especially if you just joined the company. Lack of SOPs, Lack of manpower, so one employee assigned what it seemed to be 3-4 people’s job. Worked more than 12 hours multiple times (no overtime since I’m salaried employee) to get training, to get familiarized with the products and their processes, and go over hundreds of emails, update all spreadsheets needed etc etc. Spent couple weekends working. There’s also one point I worked from 8:30 am to almost midnight just to finish the work but still can’t catch up. To the point I got sick (probably because lack of sleep focusing in catching up at work to make them happy). It’s not sustainable. Physical and Mental Health is very important too.
Advice: Clear procedure and proper training should be in place. Also, the employees are overworked and I believe that is one of the reason why an employee will leave.
Pros: Joined Loreal team year end of December 2021. Co-workers seems to be nice and very welcoming. They offer good benefits such as 401K, medical, dental, $ to spend on store every quarter and so on.

Cons: The luxury devision Is very bias to their employees. Management needs a lot of work. They have the wrong people directing and working there is like walking on eggshells. You are constantly stressed when you go into work.
Advice: Get rid of the VP of field sales
Pros: loreal has some of the best benifits a cosmetics company can offer.

Cons: Can feel like you live to work as if you are a top performer as pay is competitive but not best in the industry.
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing place to work. You are surrounded by top notch talent that is very friendly and supportive. You also have access to the best resources whether from agency partners, analytics, or learning and career growth. Fantastic family-oriented benefits. And opportunity for global mobility.

Cons: Many newer people seem surprisingly over leveled. Meetings to the point of oblivion and redundance. Due to each function being well staffed with breadth and depth, it can feel like a lot of overlap of similar functions yet not speaking to each other, particularly those who are running the businesses themselves. Seems like it could lead to unnecessary burnout, being crippled with focusing on non urgent tasks at the cost of running the business.
Advice: Cut down on meetings and consolidate all the "centers" of excellence
Pros: Very well resourced, highly matrixed (also has its drawbacks). Great culture with a healthy balance of collaboration and competition in all the right ways.

Cons: I worked at the Piscataway plant on the night shift and it’s not worth it. They’re long shifts and while the work isn’t hard, you can’t get work done. The supply rooms are never stocked with what we need: wrap, cleaners, etc. Night shift always has to clean up after morning shift, anything they didn’t feel like doing. We do not have any mechanics on our shift really, so if something goes wrong you as a packaging operator are expected to fix it or you sit there for hours. The mechanics that we do have are burnt out and leaving or have told me they are planning to. So honestly, even though we desperately need mechanics, don’t Apply. They’ll mandate you every single day and expect you to look after all 3 production floors and all their machines. L’Oréal’s biggest emphasis is production and they will badger you if you don’t make that production, even though we literally can’t make production if we don’t have mechanics or supplies. To the point where they’ll make you take your break later so you can run someone else’s line through THEIR break just to get an extra 15 minutes of production. They watch the cameras all the time to make sure that you don’t eat, take too long of a break, or go on your phone. Understandable, but with supervisors doing their rounds every few minutes and a “team” that comes in the morning to shuffle through our trash to make sure we didn’t eat on the floor is excessive. On top of that you’re given 2 15 minute breaks and 1 20 minute. The walk to the break room / off the production floor is about 3-5 minutes. There goes half your break. On top of that, other departments will purposely trigger the gates to prevent you from navigating off the production floor, so you have to wait for the gates to close so you can keep walking. You can’t break in the offices with the couches, kurigs, and fridges with snacks in them though that are on the production floor because that’s not allowed. So you’re supposed to sit on your line and do nothing, because the lines are mostly automatic. You can’t clean the machine much, because well- they’re running. Don’t trust our union representatives. They tell EVERYTHING to their friends, because I’ve had someone come up to me and ask about a situation that happened with another coworker that the union guy had to be made aware of. When I asked how they knew, he said one of the union guys tell him everything. People come and go so much, the turnover rate is terrible. It makes training them pointless, which is another point. There needs to be *designated trainers*. You’ll train with a person that doesn’t care about training you or will show you all the wrong ways of running the line. You’ll either train on a line for 2 weeks or 2 hours before you’re expected to run it, no in between. My advice is ACT YOUR WAGE. Do not do the mechanic’s job to make your numbers. Don’t overextend yourself by working through break. Etc. Honestly, don’t be a hard worker. Hard workers have to pick up the slack of everyone else. You’re doing a good job and your expected to learn all these harder lines that always break down, because nobody else wants to. Apparently since we’re in a union, we’re all supposed to make the same, but why am I being told new hires are making $25? So don’t learn that harder line that nobody else wants to, because while you’re there putting in the effort and learning dozens of lines, someone else will just stay on one line for years because they refuse to go anywhere else. Who are they going to mandate when they need one of those lines run? You, not them. They only know one line. Mandating is a promise. If you’re new, you will get mandated every single weekend and if you’re on 3rd shift, you will have to stay 4 hours over everyday even though morning shift has way too many people. Your employee badge number also won’t work until you email HR about it. Meaning you can’t access the PPI, because it’s locked behind a vending machine that needs your ID. You also won’t get your health insurance deducted from your paychecks until you bring it up. The best is needing to check every single paycheck that comes in, because payroll WILL forget to pay you for some days. We have no time off. You get 2 days for the whole year. I’ve been told we had to choose between having our BY LAW 5 sick days or a Christmas bonus. Apparently we chose the Christmas bonus. So we don’t have the legal requirement of 5 sick days. And the Christmas bonus is only $15. Good job. So don’t expect to ever go on vacation or be sick, because that’s not allowed. Don’t bother applying here unless it’s an office job or something off of the production floor. It’s not worth the stress and when I’m not working, I’m sleeping. I have no life now because of this place.
Advice: None
Pros: Free lunches sometimes, $150 store credit every few months, free goods

Cons: Company is very French and the culture can be demanding depending on the team. During COVID were one of the first companies to mandate a return to office - not a great response in my opinion. While other companies waited until at least 2021, L'Oreal ensured that people were back in office by mid-July. They pushed a message of the importance of collaboration.
Advice: None
Pros: Good people with a passion for marketing. Feel cared for and valued.

Cons: Initially was a nice place to work, until I saw the dark side of the business. For a company that makes products for women, they sure treat many women terribly. Especially women who have years of experience. I witnessed so many quality employees get treated like garbage, and eventually they bring in young people who they work into the ground. It is all about the perception, who can show off more. There are also very toxic people and teams, reminded me of high school mean girls. Get ready to work 24/7 and it still won't be enough. Beware!
Advice: None

Cons: There is definitely a specific personality type that does well and gets promoted quickly. Changing priorities, lots of changes in your business partners

Advice: None
Pros: Fast-pasted environment, opportunity for a lot of responsibility and to learn a lot

Cons: Loreal is a great marketing company with a general idea of trying to become a supply chain leader. Issue is, their current supply chain infrastructure, leadership knowledge, and overall capabilities are 20 years behind the rest of the CPG world. Culture is like start up and it's shoot first and aiming is option. Very reactive overall, and ditch to ditch month to month because they only see short term tactical and cash flow impacts. It's always a weekly or monthly fire drill. Long term strategy and planning is not extinct at Loreal, it never evolved. During my time with the company, the supply chain organization completely round tripped in a matter of around 3 years and spent the last two regressing. Leadership is too involved in day to day activities to form an idea of what they need to do long run. Leadership also has no clue how to execute at the account level and do not know what questions to even ask during an interview to determine whether someone will add value. I could give a random person some key words to say in an interview with leadership over 20 minutes or so and they could likely get an offer. Mundane tasks go through leadership. Little empowerment to execute using your own experience. Leadership diminishes roles so they can be the decision maker, own a lower level customer relationship, and prop up their resume. Leadership also very stubborn to admit what they don't know and do not listen to experienced professionals. Very siloed organization that is sales role heavy. Need to trim significant head count there to balance the organization better and bring in needed supply chain knowledgeable people. Career opportunities in the corporate office are funneled to the east coast. Very limited field sales/remote locations. If you are an experienced supply chain professional, you tackle issues that were things in 2005. You aren't going to learn any new, future oriented, next ways of working. Working for Loreal in a supply chain capacity is a good way to regress your existing experience and resume. In no way would I refer a friend or industry peer to join Loreal supply chain. Loreal will always prioritize other areas and supply chain is a career dead end cycle. The best way to show your value to Loreal is to leave.
Advice: Honestly reassess whether the organization is really wants to prioritize anything more than marketing and sales. You think you have serious aspirations to be an industry leader but you're only will to put forth occasional hobby type of effort. Try listening to experienced people that deal in both tactical and strategic execution so you can learn new ways of working. Otherwise, you completely limit very sharp people and open the door for them to leave. Lastly, work on improving inclusion as it relates to employees that have children; particularly new mothers.
Pros: Good benefits, summer hours, flex hours, hybrid work, company store w/ quarterly free goods allowance, good people. Good place to work as a first job out of college to get experience for two year. Also a good place to work if you're approaching retirement. Not a good place if you're anywhere in between those two goal posts.

Cons: micromanaged culture depending on which department you're in. Roles and responsibilities between depts is deliberately fuzzy as its part of the company culture. Management believes is forces better collaboration. In reality it forces unnecessary tension, stovepipes, disagreements, emotional exhaustion, and creates TONS of extra politcal posturing
Advice: None
Pros: Free makeup, good employee discount

Cons: French influence is too strong for an American company.

Cons: Hybrid model is 3 days a week in office - though a lot of people don't love it and it carries energy around this office sometimes. Work life balance can be pretty rough, plenty of calls past 7pm, even 9pm during busy seasons. Your current manager will control the speed in which you move up. Middle managers are not as great
Advice: Haven't met an  AVP or greater I didn't love working with at L'Oreal.
Pros: Finance runs like a well oiled machine in CPD. Great people to work with, systems are usually pretty good. Marketing is intense though fun to work with.

Pros: Great benefits and amazing people at the time I was there. Got cosmetics at great discount that you will not find anywhere else. Good culture

Pros: You get lots of makeup samples, it's a casual trendy dress.

Cons: Salary is sub-par for the amount of work expected. Company says they want employees to have some type of work/life balance (don't work too much past 5:30 pm, take your days off, including company holidays, weekends, etc.). There are no allowances for days off, because you have to meet goals set for each month, regardless... This does not allow one to actually enjoy PTO and vacation, because you end up working anyway so you don't fall behind, which makes having paid time off pointless to some degree. You have to take it because if you don't use it. You lose it.

Cons: There's a lot of turnover. Expect to leave after a maximum of 3 years. The Process Engineer team goes through several iterations as they are constantly overworked. Tried to go from contractor to full-time. It actually took forever after the interview and didn't hear anything back until I told them I got another job offer. HR was most likely holding up the interview process. After trying to do the job of two people there(they fired someone and we were expected to operate everything like normal. There wasn't any urgency trying to hire someone for sure though) I was getting burnt out and work-life balance was heavily affected.

Pros: Multinational with a multicultural vibe

Cons: - Fixed and rigid programme (rotation positions are based off company needs, often times to support the high turnover)
- Salary is fixed even after graduation, regardless of background and skillsets, everyone will get the same pay and progression
- Career progression is slow, was told by HR that career progression places more emphasis and value on years of experience compared to skillset. (i.e. can only receive a promotion after 3-6 years, otherwise it will be a 'pseudo promotion where one is 'promoted' to a 'senior role' with more workload and same pay grade) 
- Year on year increment is around 1-4% (some years with 0% increment)
- Ironically, for a company that claims to be 'people centric', HR system is poor and have pushed many Management Trainees to resign
- Work-wise: extremely high legacy systems plague the operations
Advice: - Value staff more, not just management trainees but also interns, and full time staff by giving the recognition and reward when due. 
- Progression (while yes a portion of it is tagged to experience), should not be so heavily based off that, once career progression is 'fixed' to a certain number of years and don't consider skillsets, it deters people away. 
- Management Trainee Programmes is not an avenue to make everyone (regardless of skillsets and experience) to level the salary expectations, one should still be compensated based off market rates upon graduation
Pros: - Quarterly free products but only for items where there is exceeding stock, items may take more than a month to arrive
- Team culture generally supportive with some really inspirational and wise mentors that guide

Cons: Faulty internal business processes which create some challenges Poor on-boarding plans and need to add more structure Can and should improve/ be more competitive on salaries and packages If you allow it, you can spend long hours working. You must be organised to enjoy a good work-life balance. Unfortunately, some individuals grow too quickly and are not suitable or competent enough to occupy certain senior roles High employee Turnover : great at securing &amp; recruiting talent ,unfortunately , not as good as retaining it.
Advice: Review HR involvement in key career development plans and give them more flexibility and power to support and ensure they are taking the right steps in securing and retaining talent. Ensure proper working business processes by assigning proper team members to over look the process and measure with the right KPIs. Review packages and salaries to adjust to industry norm by adding a competitive edge. Increase due-diligence on competency to join senior level roles
Pros: Enterprise-wide Exposure: Ability to liaise, present and work alongside key decision makers and top management. Stretch-Assignments &amp; Entrepreneurial Mindset Flexible Work Environment: Ability to work in an office or virtually as needed. Development &amp; Growth Opportunities: Ability to contribute to new processes, ideas, business strategies, and lead/execute as relevant. Health and Wellness Benefits Fast-paced, hands-on experience and talented dynamic collaborators. Incredible networking opportunities and building strong ties

Pros: Define and implement brand strategy in France.
- Represent and promote the brand to beauty/generalist/professional journalists
-Work with L 'Oreal's regulatory and scientific departments and BVP(formerly ARPP) to manage the legal side of the product story.
-Work closely with the sales team, both at headquarters (attending meetings with key accounts) and in the field.
-Manage a team of 35 people across 3 functions: Marketing (Group Product Manager, Product Manager)/ Sales (Supervisor, Category Manager)/ Research and Consumer Insights (Supervisor, Project Leader).
- L 'Oreal Paris, France Part of the Governing Council.
Major Achievements:
- The market share of personal care products in France improved between 2014 and 2016, with the overall market share of personal care products in France increasing by 1.5% in three years. In the very strategic "female facial" segment, market share is at an all-time high (40% value).
- Participate in projects to understand the meaning of the brand signature "You're Worth It" and how to make it more modern and relevant. In 2014, L 'Oreal was the second largest business segment in the world, after L 'Oreal Paris USA. €125m a year in media investment across five categories (skin, hair care, styling, hair colour, make-up). Responsibilities :- Define and implement French brand strategy. - To represent and promote the brand to beauty/generalist/professional journalists - management

Cons: It is not good to play with people emotions. loreal is much better than this. the demonstration of such selectivism is a blot on the image and difficult to remove. It is strange that such a decision went through and nobody got up and said that it is wrong and not fair and is anti to our values and principles. it seems few people applied maths and science to deal with people emotions.
Advice: How is this decision in line with creating the beauty that moves the world and in being inclusive, fair and upright to its own employees ?
Pros: This year many of my colleagues have been outcasted from going to annual conferences. annual conference is like a loreal trademark way of celebrating success and aspiration. employees always look forward to it. It was not like this before. celebration was inclusive and everyone was included whether you were a junior resource or a cxo. now its only for select people which makes others feel unworthy. it is like saying to those outcasted that u don't matter to us and are not part of the elite group. many people have already excluded themselves from this demonstration of exclusivism and discrimination. if their friends are not part of any such outbound then they also don't want to be.

Cons: Workplace politics, career advancement tends to be based on who you know rather than skillset and work ethic. 
Believes they are 'agile' but realistically this means a lack of direction and poor management. 
Systems and processes are extremely manual - No desire to change or improve on what has always been done
Salary is v.low in comparison to the work load, a very 'not my job' mentality
Advice: Make a plan/strategy and stick with it. 
Cutting head count and piling people with extra work is not a sustainable way to make profit
Spend money on decent systems or improving/automating processes
Understand the importance of people/roles who execute work, its great looking at strategy but you need people to actually put these into action
Listen to your employees and be pro-active: if you notice unhappiness or stress act on it, or if you see the value of someone pro-actively try to keep them happy in the business. Don't wait until the person is almost out the door. 
Have a better structure for salary, it is so inconsistence across roles and experience  and way under market
Pros: Excellent benefits inc flexible working, product discounts etc
Opportunity to quickly develop and advance your career if your network contains the right people
Opportunity to work with global teams and move internationally

Cons: everybody is playing the push game when it comes to work .. nobody is willing to step up to take accountability and eventually it all gets pushed down to the admin.
Very horrible operational process. maybe i should say little to none . operates like a start up. each dept has their own way of working.. a place where everyone likes to be acknowledged but no one wants to do the job
Horrible front desk service which does that 5 things and pushes other front desk jobs away.. seriously dont know what they are doing
all the real hardworkers are quitting the company
Advice: wake up and start looking at your internal process .. a company growing at this pace should not have such lousy operations / processes. no point hiring so many people who just want to look good but not do the actual work.
Pros: they are willing to pay for the right candidate. Flexible work arrangements though most of the staff prefer to get into office.

Cons: - Extremely difficult and challenging to make an idea come true as a local market
- A lot of time spent on handling tedious admin/compliance tasks regardless of your years of experience
- Top management direction lacking especially due to COVID's hit on total cosmetics market
- Slow-to-market where go-to-market mindset is still extremely offline-driven
- Some people are 24/7 working during off hours, weekends and even during AL
- Digital here is not really digital, and innovation-side is only from HQ
Advice: Reward the hardworkers who sacrifice their personal time to make things happen, not to take them for granted.
Pros: - A lot of internal mobility
- Across the cosmetics market, the best brand portfolio you could ask for
- Great workplace to kickstart your career as your agility and skill set really gets trained up by the fast pace
- Nurturing environment that in general accepts mistakes as long as you learn from it
- Very good staff benefits and remote work policies

Cons: Overpromising the programme of being filled with exciting challenges and exposure for a fast track career. However business needs are put first - landing role and project involvement is subjected to availability.  Learning tends to revolve around company specific processes. 

Office politics and use of power play. Routine tasks with high workload due to lean structure.  Lack of responsibility to take ownership from senior managers when issues arise , instead blame and pinpoint individuals.

In HR 'eyes' this is considered as a training and your real job experience starts from the day you receive a full-time position after the 1 year programme - so if you know what you truly want, get that role instead, otherwise you might 'waste' time rotating and not getting a role in a place which best fits your interests and strengths. For some functions, after the programme, you start off as an executive.
Advice: Walk the talk about grooming young talents, HR spends effort on initiatives however the managers have to change the mindset of MTs and interns being a means to an end.
Pros: Good brand on your resume, okay salary for a fresh grad. HR inductions and integrations help to ease one into the company in the first month but the follow up end to end during the year is poor. Few capable individuals to learn from. Learning ground on how to drive your own initiatives if your managers are supportive.

Cons: Average Salary 
Luxe promotions very limited to men - Women promotions 5 times greater than men. 
Age reach 40 and above very little chance of going further in the company 20 -39 females seem to be the priority of the company.
Not really careers for mature colleagues more a job really - no support .
People tend to be your friend when they need something - then blank you 5 mins later once they have what they needed.
Advice: Start looking at recruiting more mature people in day to day managerial roles instead of overlooking them . Stop investing in young talent start looking at talent that has been out there lived a life and seen more. This is a good place to work but can be and have the potential to be a great place to work.
Pros: Nice environment 
Good Communication 
Staff shop
Staff Allocation 
Free tea and Coffee

Cons: 1. When a company has to entice employees with higher pay, there usually is a fundamental issue
2. There are a lot of L'Oreal babies (people who have worked in the company for 15-30 years, usually from their first job), who are favoured for promotion
3. However these L'Oreal babies do not know what's out there and may potentially always think they are 'right'
4. Listening skills and empathy are severely lacking in this company
5. There are double standards and people are treated differently i.e. if you are not on the favoured list for promotion or if you have resigned you are treated like a 2nd class employee (not able to go on company trips for example)
Advice: It's the usual, not that you are don't already know from pulse survey .. listen to your employees .. and walk the talk, not just pretend to walk the talk, and also always pretend to know everything and not listen to experts that you hire externally.
Pros: Willing to pay in most cases to attract talent

Cons: -No corporate culture because of the unexperienced managers and high turnuover rate. It’s chaotic. 

-mid-level managers puts immense amount of pressure on low-level employees bcs mid-level play up to high-level.

-Your performance and happiness depend on your manager. This company was my love brand and i was treated as big talent with my first managers. but 1 new toxic manager, 1 new toxic director could be able to ruin my reputation easily??!! Haha it’s horrible

-Powerpoint obsession. Meetings are big deal in l’oreal turkey. You can prepare 200 slides of presentation in each week (190 of them are hided, many revisions, impossible deadlines)
Advice: Don’t trust your mid-level employees… they don’t have any experience to manage people. very early undeserved promotions make them more ambitious and open to make mistake in terms of business ethics
Pros: -Fancy brands
-Like a school for new graduates

Cons: Willing to increase salary - if the company is doing well and there's inflation, the company should be willing to increase one's salary
predominantly Female oriented environment - could be both plus and minus depends how you look at it and what works for you
Advice: Paying attention to the economy(inflation) and giving us increases in quarterly sales results does not translate to stagnant salaries
Pros: Work-life balance 
Kind management
Company benefits (partnerships with different brands, free/discounted products for you and your friends/family)
Career opportunities - Moving between divisions- a variety of jobs - especially in the area of marketing/e-commerce/sales
Employee trust and entrepreneurial culture - in making decisions and progressing with the business - your opinion matters in the business 
Events and taking part in a variety of different conferences- network

Cons: * Everything * Bad pay * Non transparent HR team * Management expects you to put in 50 hour weeks * Avoid this company at all costs. They work you like a dog and are short staffed!!
Advice: Company needs a revamp - invest in your people. Dont say you are a people first company and talk about the importance of culture when there is an expectation that staff work over 40 hours a week with no extra compensation.
Pros: * They do fabulous parties and glittery promotions - however, dig just a little bit into the culture and everything about this company is toxic. * Is diverse - lots of female leaders but doesn't look at diversity in terms of ethnicity in the workplace

Cons: Salaries bellow avarage
Work life balance doesnt exist
Very stressful environment due to chaotic organisation, lack of people and unrealistic deadlines
Advice: Make your best people loyal with competitive package - review salaries per market comparing to the big FMCG companies
Improve work life balance by giving as KPI to every top manager with closly monitoring actions and team feedback
Make clear RASCI for every role in the company to avoid 10% of your top talents doing all the work

Company at the forefront of the trends great for continuous learning and development 
Great opportunity for career development within the group

Advice: The L'Oréal managerial structure is goodand balanced.
Pros: Great benefits, pension scheme, free product allocation, lots of incentives and progression within the company if so inclined to put in the work.

Cons: - No words can explain how terrible and poor this company treat its employees. Best advise is to never go there if you prefer to have a life where you want to be treated with respect and have a normal work life, which many other companies can offer. Loreal know they have huge intern problems, bullying, poor leadership etc., they say that they want to change, but they will never do. In the end, what's matters is the turnover, nothing else. They all know it in the top management, but nobody really care in the end.

Cons: Middle management is too preoccupied playing politics and often junior staff get hurt in the middle of their political games (e.g. stealing ideas, being passed over for positions, etc.) No one actually wants to do any work, just want to further their own political agendas.

Company always talks about feedback culture and how it's a "people-first" company, that's ridiculous. Managers don't take feedback well and more often than not, they take your feedback and start gossiping about you to others in the company. Unless you give them good, stellar feedback, they'll take everything else that you say as an insult and start gossiping about you.
Advice: Stop playing politics and start appreciating your employees more if you want to secure higher retention rates, otherwise, you'll be losing a lot of your top talents to competitors.

Cons: Where L'Oréal falls short is on its toxic culture that it has tried for years and years to change, with little to no success. Its reputation is notorious both inside and outside the organisastion. I joined as a grad, with around 30 other grads (many of them were my good friends) and I would say now only around 10% are still working there for this exact reason. Working extremely long days, with unrealistic deadlines and timeframes is not only commonplace, it is expected and demanded. I would sometimes get to my desk at 7am and not leave until 11pm. Having breakfast, lunch and dinner at your desk is something you just have to learn to get used to. Although it is worth noting that it is very much a 'work hard play hard' culture, so long hard work is sometimes offset by socials and work events (although I hear this is few and far between these days due to budget cuts).

The long hours and demanding work is not the worst aspect of the culture, however. Having only spent my professional career at L'Oréal I thought a culture of bitchiness, bullying, humiliation and disrespect was normal of every big corporation. I had no idea how wrong I was until I eventually left to go and work for another large conglomerate, which couldn't be further from this. General managers will humiliate you in large team meetings by challenging and criticising your decisions in a demeaning and derogatory way, and colleagues will throw each other under the bus to get ahead in their own career. General managers will pitch you up against your counterparts in a way that is so obvious and uncomfortable, it makes you permanently anxious and afraid that you are not living up to expectation. Despite the division being made up of majority females, CPD has a toxic masculine culture where males within the division will roast other colleagues in things like team quizzes, large email threads etc in the name of 'workplace banter'. Often this can be uncomfortable to witness, as its clearly borderline bullying, but everyone is complicit and says nothing in the name of not 'rocking the boat.' HR are fully aware and do nothing about it. At a more junior level interns and grads are given inexperienced managers who are trying to flex their new managerial muscles and make their interns miserable with harsh words, unrealistic expectations and passive aggressive emails. Personally, as an intern I would walk home nearly every day in tears, but again just thought this was part and parcel of 'normal' corporate life. 

Of course its not all bad, and I worked with some lovely colleague and managers. But for the most part I would strongly recommend you do NOT work at L'Oreal unless you have an outrageously thick skin, and if you're happy to give up your entire life to the job.
Advice: None
