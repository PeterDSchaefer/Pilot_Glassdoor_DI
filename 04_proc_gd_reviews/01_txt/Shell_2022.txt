Cons: I wanted to move from New Orleans to Houston, and a team in Houston said they wanted me on their team. The New Orleans team blocked the move. If you want to advance your career or want a change, do it externally to Shell, don't let Shell hold you back. Poor work life balance, lots of after hours calls and a typical week is already 60 hours. Company continues to make this worse by laying people off. People are frequently promoted into roles they are not qualified for. This is frustrating when you have to teach senior people how to do their job, but also stressfill when it happens to you . Management of Change process is very cumbersome. Very poor software is used. Shell was very cowardly about oil and gas outlook in 2020. When oil was cheap and we should have been spending big money on maintenance and refurbishment, they focused on laying off employees. By the time "project reshape" was executed, gas was back to $80 per barrel.
Advice: The matrix style organization is taken a little too far... your junior employees need to work directly for a manager. Don't block moves... Upgrade IT infrastructure. Especially MOC and SAP.
Pros: Good Pay. Lot's of training amd education. Very interesting work.

Cons: Salaries especially for JG5 and JG4 (ex: associate engineer and engineer, respectively) are falling behind greater industry standards. Management refuses to compare with talent outside of O&amp;G, which happens to be where the best talent resides, while touting how much digitalization they want to achieve. It would take a minimum of 10 years to get to a competitive total compensation. We are losing young talent to tech where even remote pay will easily start 2 times higher than Shell's starting comp. People under 40 will leave for greener grass, creating a void of technical talent for years to come.
Advice: Shell being a large company has plenty of room for an employee to explore different career paths although a good sponsor or mentor is necessary to vouch for you. That being said, although the benefits package is still very solid, Shell needs to step up their cash/stock compensation game to recruit and retain talent, not just hoard cash for management. Too many times have middle managers walked away with 10 times the bonus of a lower employee that has worked equally as hard or harder. Making a (rather small) one-time adjustment on the bonus after not paying bonuses or raising base salaries the previous year while leadership continues to rake in millions is sending a terrible message to the supposed greatest asset of the company - the people.
Pros: Health (free annual exam with premium discounts, plus full coverage on cancer and cardiac-related illnesses) and relocation (sizeable lump sums with additional services) benefits are substantial. Pension is still available but the structure is not as good as it used to be. Various corporate discounts are available, particularly in Houston. Overall, a complex organization in a very complex industry that makes you appreciate the global drive for energy transition.

Cons: - 5+ years ago Shell jobs were dynamic and fulfilling, but HR transformation has led to less exciting roles. Roles are challenging but mostly due to complicated stakeholder management. Now business partnering jobs will take much longer to reach unless you're identified as high potential. I think many other companies may also be headed in this direction unfortunately.
- Work/life balance is promoted but going beyond is valued and recognized. That coupled with job insecurity due to frequent reorganization leads to lots of people getting burned out to avoid making mistakes or being laid off. It can also sometimes lead to people shifting responsibility/blame to other people or CoEs to save face.
Advice: - 9/80s won't be enough to keep people forever (especially if people end up working on their days off anyway), and comp/benefits are becoming less competitive with the growing tech industry.
- Be cognizant of office politics that exist and keep working to make people feel safe going against the grain.
Pros: - Some employees are truly wonderful and genuine people and coworkers can become like family. 
- Flexible hours, and 9/80s are hard to beat.
- Great bonuses when business is performing well.
- Lots of passion around D&amp;I, great affinity groups.
- As far as big players in the industry go, Shell does seem to be trying hard to transform itself and move towards being more environmentally-friendly.

Cons: Inflated competition People are promoted based on his/her ratings when they were hired and it cant be changed during your employment, doesnt matter what you do. As the result of these two statements, majority of the employees are there for salary/benefits only. Good employees usually leave with the package deals, and you are left with whatever is left.....
Advice: Get rid of all managements
Pros: Good Salary and other benefits

Cons: No heath offered to full or part time ..You have to be manager or higher....its also Franchise owner so basically no real job security..They expect way more than your paid...pay is bi weekly..also seniority over who really needs hours...They go out there way to get you to quit if problems accrue in employment..As of right now I'm off schedule due to seniority..When confronted they're quick to tell you everything that's wrong with you. .Who needs that crap and if you are having personal issues they think you are on drugs..Rumors spread quick due to Management telling anyone who has ears your stuff. .Dont Work for this company if you value yourself and ethics..
Advice: My advice is quit your job ..under qualified and just cause you are salary dont make you better than me ..your just a  glorified shift leader...Stop asking your employees to do something you wouldn't do!!!
Pros: The costumers....THATS the whole reason I stayed!!!

Cons: Salary is low compared to market comps.
Moving away from hybrid to more time in office 3+ days.
Campus is boring... Wish we worked downtown
Advice: Allow people to continue hybrid as work productivity and creativity has not dropped.
Raise salaries - ensure equitable pay across genders
Pros: The people are truly wonderful. 
The work is relatively exciting.
Hard lean into the Energy Transition, which creates a lot of exciting opportunities for growth and development.

Cons: The progression is too slow. Work-life balance depends on who is your boss and where you work. If he is a micro-manager expect no work-life balance. Senior Management unapproachable.
Advice: None

Cons: low 401k contribution unless you been there for 10 years
is a union plant ... so be prepare for strike when ever contract time comes arounds
no work life balance

must schedule vacation 1 year in advance or you might not get it ( plant needs come before your life)
promote safety ... just promote
unable to transition to a new role unless you know someone
I was told your hired for a role and your going to stay in that role
Advice: they have their favorites
Pros: good pay
plenty of overtime
willing to teach you your job
good company if your not an operator and want to move up
great shell is in a great position for economy needs

Cons: Pay isn't good! Especially for how hard I work!
Advice: Starting pay should go by experience. I can't live on what I make. No one can. I shouldn't have to ask for a raise. If my work is good, better than, I should be compensated appropriately. That's the reason employees have left. And I think why it's so hard to get new employees.
Pros: Really like the job. Love coworkers and bosses. Company seems great. Good schedule. Good amount of hours. Customers are great. Location is good. Store recently remodeled. Clean.

Advice: None
Pros: Shell has a great people culture, diversity is very important, if desired you can have a life long career, and pay &amp; benefits are great.

Cons: Boredom is tantamount, as it is almost never busy.  The worst thing to deal with is a lack of respect from employers. I am often told to do the work of other employees, do things not in my job description, and work inconsistent schedules. Although the manager has a perfect schedule with an extra hour of overtime added every day, no one else is promised even the normal amount of full-time hours. Boss collects overtime while all other employees work whatever hours they're given because apparently the business can barely afford it.
Advice: Stop stealing hours from the employees to collect over time, especially when the business "cant afford to give us overtime."
Pros: Decent pay and not too difficult of a job. Much of what needs to be done can be finished in a few hours, and the rest of the shift is spent killing time.

Pros: Talks a good talk. Business is necessary for today's world.

Cons: Pay vs. Duties= pitiful. Too much is expected for such terrible pay. Raises not applied as promised.
Advice: Pay more and you'll keep your help.

Advice: None
Pros: Good hours. Mostly great customers.

Cons: Travel can be much. Sometimes hard to reach higher management.
Advice: n/a
Pros: Good Pay, enjoyable environment, good benefits.

Cons: New daily tasks involving maintaining oil production are frequent and urgent but you are  still above all expected to make time for your own discipline development projects (Electrical, Mechanical, Chemical, etc.). This can be difficult to get around to with the workload.

New work cannot be completed before crossing over to opposite every 2 weeks, so backlog inevitably piles up especially as engineers cycle out of the role every year or so.
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay and benefits for graduate role out of college

Most coworkers are high performers and willing to help teach new hires

Large company allows flexibility with movement across and up to different roles, giving employees the freedom to learn different skills

Cons: May not be able to provide full-time opportunities. Being alone at a gas station can be nice, but its not great when things get crazy, and people really do not like to wait in line at a store which is literally titled "convenience".
Advice: None
Pros: Workplace is nice for those who prefer to work alone/mostly independently.

Cons: when headcount reduction is announced, citizenshop is a priority in deciding if you are staying or not.

Advice: Hire actually good people to run your stores
Pros: Great Customers, Easy job. Period

Cons: Work is not merit-based, Promotions and Perks are all based on politics. Even if one politically significant person dislikes you, you are limited. And the dislike does not have to be substantiated. Set low expectations for your employment. At least you'll earn average pay while working as a servant. That's typical for most of the people who work here.

The work environment is based on the oil price: a high oil price means a normal work environment, low price means you can be fired tomorrow. So be on alert.
Advice: None
Pros: Compensation is average. You can definitely get the same in other places.

If you are good at playing politics, then it is a great company for you. You do not need to know anything and you'll be a manager before you know it.

Cons: I can't really think of anything I don't like about Shell.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay, great benefits, great people, great work life balance!

Cons: My boss hits on me
Advice: Don’t ask me on a date my first shift
Pros: I like the smell of gas

Pay is good

Cons: Shift work isn’t for everyone, so can be challenging at times having a life outside of work. Management has some issues and the work isn’t always fair or within the bounds of realistic expectations.

Cons: the work sucks a lot
Advice: None
Pros: the schedule is very flexible

Cons: Heavy workload, a lot of legacy issues that you need to clean. Management always promote Continuous Improvement (CI) project and digitalization but no proper guidance given and simply wants the team to blindly do, in the end it is not sustainable. A lot of the hiring managers already have preferred candidate when they want to advertise a role which end up causing unfairness and favouritism because the candidate has been selected even before the role is being advertised or interviews are conducted. When questions being asked to the management, the answers given are unprofessional and not precise. Good and capable employees are being hold in the role for so long but bad and incapable employees are given with the chance to move quickly because managers dont want the 'bad weeds' to be in their team.
Advice: If management really look at capable employees as an asset to the company, make sure to brush up their skills and improve their knowledge by providing proper guidance/training and dont hold them in a role for so long just to ensure stability of the team. This excuse doesnt work anymore because people can feel if they are being valued or under valued. People can be streched but  if they are being stretched too much, they will be broken. Eventually, you only have those bad/boot-licking/incapable employees in the company and the company will stumble.
Pros: Flexible working time, flexible working arrangement (work from office/home), friendly colleagues, good salaries and benefits (you can earn 5-figure salary as early as at the age of late 20s).

Cons: The other side of the coin of a high performing environment is that a competitive environment may also exist. It is up to yourself to take that as a positive challenge or not. Benefit wise - it is not as good as 5 or more years ago. Regardless, it is still among the best among other companies in the same industry. Finally, Shell has a tendency to overcomplicate things and making a lot of terms/phrase/jargon into abbreviations. It may take some time to familiarize with it.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, everyone is professional and very welcoming, all the seniors are always happy to help with questions and your learning development. It is a place where you take full responsibilities of your own future and development in the company. Everyone is entitled to training budgets annually, and that means every year you will learn and grow.

Cons: - No focus or methods on ensuring quality delivery but just routine, mundane work 
- IT processes, methodology &amp; tools running in mediaeval period. Some are adopted under pressure to keep up with current market to avoid difficult questions from vendors
- lip service and eye wash on targets &amp; values but no org. Or leadership actions or intent on adoption or ruthless drive to faster outcomes 
- people culture is overrated. Appraisal system on bell curve is just for the record but 80% in d center and rest 20% just above it. Seldom anyone is rated Lower. Mediocrity is standard. PIP is more headache and job risk for supervisors than reportee
- no respect for talent and value drive but exceptional efforts on retention of non-performance in the name of engage &amp; inspire. Haven for incompetent resources 
- extreme demotivation for people who are aspirational &amp; talented as growth stops after a while as executive positions are kept for outside India
- HR staff themselves misbehave and don't treat staff with respect and showcase insanity despite they being the face up for any org.
Advice: Pyschological Safety push is doesn't mean retain &amp; standardize non-performance. There has to be a metric for weighing a learners mindset. If this attitude and vision continues for IDT, it won't be long when eventually the whole IDT would be a white elephant with extremely unacceptable &amp; poor quality delivery to our business, resulting in outsourcing to d big IT service suppliers in d industry.
Pros: - Clear strategies for positive impact to powering lives and sustainability
- Good policies on travel

Cons: Pay is not very sustainable for employees in the lower job groups. It is comfortable for an individual with a single status, but if you already have a family, you might need your husband or wife to also work. You may also come across managers who are not so competent or toxic. WLB would depend on the team you joined.
Advice: None
Pros: A healthy, safe, and an inclusive environment for its employees. There are literally a bunch of company-wide sessions (or sometimes even celebrations) about diversity &amp; inclusion, mental health awareness, burnout, people with disabilities, etc. Work-Life balance can be achieved. Even if you work long hours, it's still more acceptable than the long hours in big auditing firms or global banks. Its values (Honesty, Integrity, Respect for People) are also evident in its senior management . Career opportunities are vast since the company itself has a diverse range of operations, even in Finance or Customer Operations alone.

Cons: I have been offered a role with Arabic language. Later they came back to me &amp; offered a job with Turkish language. Finally one day before the joining date, they changed to English language only job. I agreed &amp; they agreed to pay me the language bonus of 3 months upfront &amp; remaining after one year if I get indefinite contract. I trusted them and agreed to all their terms conditions. But it was too late for me to understand that I'm was being deceived by managers with false promises of long-term contract. It was agreed internally already to terminate me in one year so that they can save the language bonus compensation. I never seen such an unethical company talking about ethics and zero-net emissions. As long as they talk, they keep being unethical and more carbonising. Shameful and pathetic. Toxic and nasty workplace.
Advice: Please be ethical and be transparent towards your resources. Never betray them!
Pros: Nothing but false promises and obsolete internal tools Toxic workplace Stressful and machine like slaves Non-diverse workforce

Cons: - Rigid &amp; Inflexible Leadership - Poor Corporate Culture - Under-resourced (hire more people)
Advice: Train your leaders to show empathy and compassion. Too many of the newly promoted leaders, think leadership is all about results and forget about the people aspect of work. There is too much micro-management as a result. Assess your people properly for leadership positions, being a good specialist doesn’t necessarily qualify you to be potentially a good leader. If you need a reference of good leadership, there are great examples in T&amp;S Operations. You are losing great talent and will continue to do so because of inexperienced leaders. It might not look like it, but having people honouring their contracts doesn’t mean they are not looking outside. The Joburg office has a leadership crises!
Pros: - Remuneration - Work/Life Balance

Cons: Your experience depends on your manager. The one I was under with is biased and has preferred candidates because s/he referred them. Even if you work diligently and has good record than the new hires, s/he will push the new hires for promotion instead. Also, the heavy workload. Expect it every month-end and year-end. Be wary of a teammate who might talk behind your back. I experienced someone who is rude when I ask nicely and shared personal matters to the manager. Even going out with your closed teammates (who became friends) is a big deal to them. There is no boundary at all. Consider this position for experience. But expect that there is no work-life balance to it.
Advice: Put referrals to the different team and not on the same team with the one who referred by the manager.
Pros: Teammates are helpful. Workplace is nice. Free coffee in different floors.

Cons: - Though of lot of teams do good DS work, most teams do not - There is a rigid 2 to 4 year lock-in period in moving teams/roles. If you are caught in one of the bad teams, your only option is to move out - They will take up any work if it brings in money, without much focus on quality of work
Advice: As much as you trumpet your DS/AI initiatives, also focus on weeding out teams/projects that have very little overlap with DS/AI. Value you the skillset of your resources and map them in appropriate projects.
Pros: - Work-life balance is good - Lot of teams do quality Data Science work - Exposure to Azure platform - Pay is on par if not better than the industry

Cons: You have to go for your marketing and advertisement of your work which you have done, if you are working silently then even after all your efforts and goal is accomplished you will not get good rating in the end.

In simple words, If you have completed any work then in next second you have to go for advertisement of that work also otherwise you will lose your point🙂.

I haven't done the above so I got that result too, hope you learn from it and don't make the same mistake.

If someone is from Shell, they can co relate it to their own experience, and if I'm wrong you can correct me and share your thoughts too.
Advice: Management has to be fair, if an employee is putting his best effort then he deserves a good rating and result also. If the employee is not performing well and thinks that he is a hard worker then in that case also management have to tell him that you didn't do this work so you have to improve yourself. If the management is not giving fair feedback then the employee may feel disappointed by treating him/her as a great employee but with less than expected rating.
Pros: I joined Shell virtually, so I can't say much about the work environment, but it seems to be a decent working environment according to Virtual Connect. The team members are very cooperative, they will help you when you need it.

Cons: Lower pay compared to other multinational companies that also offer good work-life balance
Minimal salary increase over the years
Willing to lose people to other companies because it will not budge on its global pay policy
higher managers earn 14th month pay. middle managers to staff get only 13th month pay.
Advice: You're losing talent because you're unwilling to budge when it comes to salary. BPOs within your industry are not the only competitors you have. higher level managers already have the benefit of higher salary. make 14th month pay a benefit across all job groups
Pros: Work life balance (best I've experience in my career)
promotes psychological safety, diversity, equity and inclusion
unlimited coffee and juice drinks in the pantry
really great office space
midshift transpo (they'll bring you to your house if within serviced areas)
better pay over local companies
great opportunities available as long as you give your best
lots of great leaders who are flexible to accommodate unforeseen personal circumstance
if money is not an issue due to financial responsibilities, this is a really great place to start and build your career.

Cons: Pay was not adequate and did not match expectations of the position Gossip Recognition was rare. Expected to cover shifts almost every day off and treated poorly if you refused.
Advice: Appreciate your employees, if you treat us like we are replaceable we will treat you like you are :)
Pros: I worked here until 2015 but there was no option for that and I just want to look at reviews but they force me to do this first so. It was fine, It's usually pretty busy and as a manager there was always a lot to do. Customers are very nice for the most part.

Cons: - Your experience can depend on the team you are in. There are some teams with incompetent leaders or sometimes individual contributors with an informal leadership role. A classic example is a former manager who was moved to an individual contributor role. - Pay is not competitive, even if they claim they do - Lack of flexibility on working arrangements - Lack of external perspectives
Advice: External perspectives, especially in the Finance and IDT functions, will go a long way. Hire more competent people to run the department.
Pros: Great culture. The team I was in truly embodies Shell's values as well as the Learner Mindset

Cons: Working at this particular shell garage was awful you are overworked .worked on my own between 5pm and 11pm where I had to lock up by myself which was extremely worrying . Being on your own at work rush hour and having to cook work on tills watch the forecourt whilst people put their fuel in take fuel delivery's .if a pump stopped working ypu would have to go out and section it off leaving in one in the store .card machines constantly broke. Needed a manager to over ride things on till but there was never a manger on shift with . And being treated like rubbish by alitnif the customers this job took a toll on my mental health . This may just be for the particular shell garage i worked for so
Advice: When working in a petrol station  2 people need to be on shift
Pros: Some nice understanding customers. And when the shift was over

Cons: Not much growth for technically strong employees after you are into senior position.
BAs are most valued.
Your technical skills doesnt matter at all to the company but your over and above visibility stunts matter. 
If you are a dead wood, just somehow find a way inside and you can stay there forever without doing much work.
Frequent reorgs benefit who are impacted as they get a chance to find higher roles.
Your line manager who doesnt take part in your day to day work assess your performance based on your visbility rather than delivery.
Overall No for people who are looking for career growth in tehnology but Yes for people who are BAs or are not successul in IT but have good networking social skills.
Advice: Focus on delivery which is what matters to the company. How much value employee generates through its work is what matters the most not visibility(glorified word for everyone knows what).
Pros: Good global travel policies.
Good pay which lagged behind in post Covid boom.
Decent yearly increments before Covid.

Cons: Some would think that it would not be beneficial for their career growth if to being tied down for four years in the same role.
Advice: None
Pros: I am thankful to be given an opportunity to be in a team that has a really good culture and a manager who actually helps and provides guidance along the way. Workload is still manageable and there is a trustworthy management.

Cons: Can end up working over 14 hours a day 
Lunch breaks can disappear due to being overworked and on your feet all day with no time to rest and refresh your mind 
Can be an extremely stressful environment with issues of IT systems going down and waiting for support for it to be fixed and dealing with the chaos of the public frustration that your station isn't open again for the 4th time that week because of IT issues
Advice: Head strong 
Willing to go over the usual working time hours in a day
Willing to overlook any food breaks all day
Willing to deal with repetitive problems
Pros: Lot of hours avaliable 
Always on your toes and busy everyday
Free parking
Uniform provided

Cons: Long working hrs especially in global roles Many VP level and up leaders have very poor people management skills. They got to where they are for IQ not EQ. Even with bottom quartile team leader skills in the employee satisfaction survey they stay where they are or get promoted.
Advice: Move out leaders with consistent low team leadership skills over the years, and put them into individual contributor roles. They make people’s work lives quite frustrating and cost the company talent in the end.
Pros: Good benefits Focus on fair treatment of people Flexible working arrangements (if not in Manufacturing)

Cons: This is a positive - the stress that comes with the work. The responsibility is huge and one have to be on his toes to always deliver. Excellent delivery is our culture
Advice: None
Pros: Global leader in everything energy. At the centre of and driving the energy transition. Opportunity to help deliver the energy that powers progress across the world. Cutting edge technology and you can be what You want to be. Opportunity to work in one of the hundreds of sectors that make up the giant, as well as work in different Beau countries across the world. A diverse workplace full of love, acceptance and tolerance. Opportunity to develop and contribute to tangible real world projects.

The employee value proposition is top quartile.

Cons: Promotion after 4 years of buttering only.
No respect in the workplace at all.
Manager bash at their reporting employees like anything.
Managers sexually harass their employees as well.
No appreciation &amp; recognition until you do something that saves them money.
It's been hell for me and for other as well. There's a reason there are around 40+ opening because people are leaving. Nobody wants to stay here.
If you put papers, they'll treat you like animals.
This is worst than many service based company. 
The pay grade is damn below the average.
If the HR is saying, you'll get lots of benefit, don't believe them that's a scam.
One you join the company there is nothing called as perks.
Please leave this company even after a month of joining.
This is a sh** place to work for.
There is no career opportunity. Once you get in a team, you'll be there forever until unless you leave. No learning. Lots of favoritism.
Advice: Check on your manager and how they are treating their employees and just scheduling skip level meeting and ignoring the questions based on salary won't help.
Pros: No Pros for this company.

Cons: Difficult and heavy organization with a lot of hierarchical procedures that only hinder the work and take up time Unprofessional and untrained line management Mobbing Standard “flattering the manager” agenda and a lot of drama on top of hard work Personal relationship are valued more than professional Corporate culture can be toxic and intrusive and is more a “show” then the real care
Advice: More accurate selective process for local line management positions Clearer organization of work Try apply agile
Pros: Salary Bonuses Project type of work.

Cons: When people ask for promotion majority of people of being told that first finish your 4 years then they will talk about it. Slow growth and recognition in the terms of coorporate ladder.
Advice: Just recognition given in a project meeting is not enough. People need to rewarded in terms of growth too in the company which means growing financially and level wise too.
Pros: - Good work culture in terms of equality, diversity and open platform for discussion - safety and health first. Good learning opportunity in some of the projects

Cons: None observed as of now
Advice: None
Pros: 1. The organisation culture is curated to be highly empathetic towards their employees. 

2. Organisation structure enables and ensures every employees are treated with same amount of respect, care and love
 irrespective of their designation.

3. The HR processes are transparent with many added perks/ benefits and unobstructed access to higher management.

4. Unlimited sick leaves

5. Immense learning opportunities and avenues to develop leadership skillsets

6. Values networking between employees

Cons: Cons are poor management and insecurity driving poor behaviours, in some cases.
Advice: weed out the insecure managers who do not reward talent due to their own insecurities. Give management training in honest communciation and personal development so they have the capacity to do the right thing in every case
Pros: Amazing rewards, amazing pathway for the select few - those who are talented, and for those who know how to align with the right people.

Cons: - Lot of unnecessary bureaucracy. 
- Unskilled &amp; uneducated management for technical roles or when supervising technicians. 
- Poor management leads to false expectations on you, blur direction.
- Less and less IT roles opened on Americas and Europe, lot of them moved to India.
Advice: For IT: get more hands on with tools and with the real work, get education on vendor-based certifications; talk more with the doers and less with middle-management.
Pros: - Work life balance (if you choose so). 
- Top tier education/trainings for yourself. 
- Good job stability and pay.

Cons: Since the pandemic and the 'Reshape' restructuring project announced in 2020, the company leadership and culture really changed -- what used to be a supportive culture became a toxic one, where the senior leadership seemed more interested in preserving their own salary grades than creating a really customer-centric business that would thrive in the energy transition.
Advice: If you want real culture change to carry through the energy transition, you need to change the senior most leadership, bringing in 50%+ external leaders, and no longer have VP+ execs who all boast they have 'been at Shell for 20+ years'.
Pros: Bright, kind, international colleagues trying to solve some of the world's hardest problems. Great London headquarters office location. Good pay and bonus, pension and healthcare, annual leave and parental leave policies. Great support for healthy work life balance. Made a lot of friends with wonderful people!

Cons: Working longer hours when necessary
Advice: You hire someone who is interested in working in your company and in this field, if he is not interested, then you make him the CEO, then he will not work. If I have even the slightest interest, he will be able to do great things even in a small position, thanks
Pros: Iam now ready to join your team,and use my skills and learn from your talented team.
I have also heard that your company has allocated education fund for young graduates to study further.It would be a great opportunity for me to study further and work here.

Cons: Frequent reorganisation Monotonous ways of working Less control on India LTs
Advice: Leadership team has a great vision, long term strategy has been defined that is win win situation for both the organisation and environment.
Pros: Competitive Salary Transparency Driven by great leaders Great Ambiance and workplace

Cons: Very process and systems oriented , sometimes takes longer times in executing things. Flat organisation
Advice: Benchmark with market compensation as many employers are offering better perks and compensation and taking away best groomed talent
Pros: Gives complete authority in job roles. No hierarchy and can easily reach to top leadership.

Cons: Workload imbalance. Instead of hiring best people for process improvement or consultants - they guise continuous improvement efforts in games and targets that every employee must reach. They would tire people out on delivering cost efficient measures and most that an employee can get is some pennies along with a high five. No, they don't patent ideas - they claim it as the company's.
Advice: Hire a consultant, hire the best so they can pass it on - they can develop people. Don't preach about work life balance when you would send a message on a Sunday night asking people to check their laptop since a truck needs to be rescheduled.
Pros: They are very particular with the safety of their people, whatever aspect it can be. The company would provide all of the things one needs, including the best healthcare privileges and allowances. Their benefits are top tier coming from a person who has worked in a number of multinational companies.

Cons: Leaders are horrible - they aren't classed as leaders but more like BOSSES! Very biased and racist leaders. They DO NOT care for their employees at all. Luckily John the so called CPO has left the company. Although his title says Chief People Officer, he is not at all a people person. Alec who is a so called Head of Comms, just doesn't know how to communicate with the business in his comms and ends up being very harsh in his articles that end up hurting employee's feelings (very arrogant and shrewd person). Managers on the floor as well aren't very great. If you're working for Shell Energy - you're just another number for them making them money. People don't last long there because the work culture isn't good at all. This place is filled with bossy and arrogant people. No scope for development. You will only get a chance to develop if you are good buddies with the bosses!
Advice: Appreciate your employees. If you do it - do it fairly. Help your employees to grow and develop. Don't tell them how to do their JOB - they are hired for a reason, instead give them tools to excel and grow in what they are hired for. Don't just sack people just because they don't agree with your way of thinking... Instead hear out and listen to their views - it will help you being open minded not narrow minded! By giving your employees a fair chance to grow it will not only benefit them but in the long run it will benefit your company. Happy employees = Happy clients and Great customer service + great company culture. Yes Financial goals are important however employees should be kept at the heart of anything you do (remember actions speak louder than words).
Pros: The cafeteria is lovely. You have parking area

Cons: Weak management, high workload, low level of trainings. Typical corporate politics.
Advice: Provide proper training and coaching to motivate and empower people. They expect too much from employees getting paid average salaries. Talk less and do more.

Cons: local terms for pay might not be encouraging especially in countries with high inflation Pay is paid is local currency &amp; may vary with similar jobs or positions in other climes
Advice: None

Cons: Company could do better in terms of growing on a faster pace.
Advice: None
Pros: Shell is amazing when it comes to the safety and health of its employees.
