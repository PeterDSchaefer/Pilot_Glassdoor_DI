Cons: Tiny market share becoming even smaller and smaller and smaller.................................
Advice: None
Pros: A name to be proud of and a product that deservedly is loved by many.

Cons: It is not clear what career path you can have when you join the company. Currently there is a lot of encouragement towards horizontal moves of people, cross-functionally. The Swedish mindset and culture brings positives, such as a flat organization and democracy, and a great work-life balance, but it also generates a laid back working culture, with very few ambitious people willing to walk the extra mile.
Advice: None
Pros: The designed around you culture means there is a lot of focus on people development and the leadership practices are oriented towards positive and constructive feedback, encouraging employees to have initiative and be proactive. The industry as such is very dynamic and rapidly changing, and working for Volvo which is a quite small player compared to BMW or Mercedes, means more exposure to the industry, different departments and projects.

Cons: The desicion making process can be quite slow
Advice: None
Pros: Qualified personnel, great working conditions, good atmosphere
