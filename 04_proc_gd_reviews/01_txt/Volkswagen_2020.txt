Cons: They treat their employees like dirt! Cuss out the employees and punish them by making employees work on their off days. They raise hell if customers choose to go elsewhere, not come back in, buy a vehicle or leave after just browsing as if it’s in the employees control to stop a customer or force them to buy a car! Upper management just sits around yelling at employees all day long if sales aren’t coming in. It’s just ridiculous how the owner of this dealership allows this type of behavior to go on when the real problem is their own judgement of who manages their store! One manager steals other teams deals and puts his name on it to make himself look good and tries to save himself while throwing others under the bus. If they aren’t firing people, people are quitting all of the time because of the disrespectful ways they treat people then expect employees to be happy there and be happy serving customers! Employees barely can take 5 minutes to chew a bite of their lunch! They say this is a THRIVING location but there’s a HUGE difference between THRIVING and slaving your employees. Labor Law Attorney is coming their way pretty soon! I would never recommend this place to anyone- customers or employees! How do you expect to have a solid team to make sales for your business if all you do is treat them like slaves!? If any changes need to be made it’s ownership and selection of management!
Advice: Forget management! The owner needs to get involved! Look at who has been managing your store for a while now and start with making changes there before you try to fire people that put in all of their time and hard work at your dealership! It’s ridiculous that all of your employees feel unappreciated and worked like slaves because your management has anger problems and cusses people out every 5 seconds!
Pros: None! This place is horrible and I don’t recommend anyone to even apply here unless you’re ok with making no sales and getting cussed out! Literally. It has been poor management here for a while now and it’s not getting any better because the owner keeps the same problems managers!

Cons: Worst place for a Software Engineer to make any kind of career. Every single department is a disaster, ego tripping everywhere, everyone is trying to reach the end of the month to get their salaries for the next one. No one has any idea how to make software, they think that's like making a car, it doesn't work this way.

No one can't be fired, this is a nest of incompetence.
Advice: Fire incompetent people and take some time to make some reflection about yourselves. Whatever decision you are going to take soon, doing taking this in mind, do actual people have the competence to "Drive the future of mobility"? If not... fire them. This whole situation is contraproducent for the goals of the company, this many external companies... they's no accountability, ownership for anything we do, the daily job is reduced to a game of blaming others. It's just a big hierarchical structure, where everyone is blaming and fingerpointing each other for their mistakes instead of working as a team towards a common goal, this mindset percolates even in small departments and even amongst team members, or teams.
Pros: Stability, pension, the workers council will make sure to make you stay (although this is bad, as incompetent people will always stay)

Cons: Not busy = means that it is really quite boring, and not just for my position either the sales team are equally as bored.

Where to start?
• Poor training, had no idea what was going on for the majority of my employment and therefore I didnt learn anything to help me develop any skills.
•Lack of communication between all the departments, leads to a lot of confusion
•Manager was way too passive aggressive 
•The Sales team were quite good at returning calls, however some members of the service team just dont care (I dont blame them) but the consequences are that customers get angry at le receptionist. (Which reminder, wasnt trained for)
•Diversity is probably good, the other employees had low key racist comments or discriminatory comments to certain races etc.

Additional meh things:
•The layout of the place made it very hard to see things and do my job
•Update employee areas please, the toilets were horrible, the kitchen was just grim and had very basic things, just a kettle actually
•You would think for a multi million or billion company they would provide more for the staff like lunch, better utilities, even caring and that's free
•Sick isnt paid which is just stupid
