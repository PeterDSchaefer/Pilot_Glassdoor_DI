Cons: Aggressive culture that can be very cut throat at times. Lots of changes. Continuous pressure to outperform previous years and previous product launches. Not a lot of work life balance. The general sense is that the company doesn't care about you as an employee. I know many people who took leaves of absence due to mental health impacts of the job. A lot of politics and abusive behavior. I would not recommend working here.
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of opportunities to learn in a fast paced environment for a globally renowned company.

Cons: Strict technology policy. You can't bring a personal laptop and your phone if you get their "Proprietary" software inhibits most functions on your phone. Your phone is your only real gateway to anything outside of the company. Everything is tracked heavily from where you badge in and out of, to the websites you look at if you are bored. Lastly, the biggest con in my opinion, is the company is massively "Woke". Guys can't say anything in any joking manner without looking over their shoulder like the policy police are out to get them fired. This is not an exaggeration. As a result, I never talk to anyone outside of people I absolutely have to for business reasons.
Advice: Stop being political in your corporate policies and allow people actual freedom of speech.
Pros: Overall the company is good at compensating the employee. Seems like there is always someone getting food for some type of reason. GWP as they call it. Being salary, there is no issue submitting for extra pay when you come in extra although it's capped at 300 per occurrence. This depends on job grade. Lower job grades salary is 150 per occurrence. The people in my immediate group are all pretty good it seems. Although this might be slanted because I am in management and don't see what the average worker sees.

Cons: Management and teams are often outsourced and under budgeted resulting in chaos when coordinating cross teams and platforms
Advice: Allow field ops to make executive decisions over scummy 3rd parties
Pros: Samsung is truly one of the forefronts of technology, so naturally you get to be part of it

Cons: Workload and Deadlines: Like many technology companies, Samsung operates in a fast-paced environment, often demanding tight deadlines and high workloads. This can sometimes lead to work-life balance challenges and periods of intense pressure. However, with effective time management and prioritization, it is possible to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Bureaucracy: As a large organization, Samsung has a certain level of bureaucracy, which can occasionally slow down decision-making processes. Navigating through various layers of management and getting approvals for certain initiatives can be time-consuming. However, the company has been actively working to streamline processes and improve efficiency. Limited Autonomy: In certain cases, as a software engineer, I felt that decision-making authority was concentrated at higher levels within the organization. This limited the level of autonomy and ownership I had over certain projects. However, this can vary depending on the team and project, and it's important to proactively communicate and collaborate with colleagues and supervisors to influence decision-making processes.
Advice: None
Pros: Technological Advancements: Samsung is at the forefront of technological advancements, and as a software engineer, I had the chance to work on exciting projects that pushed the boundaries of innovation. The company invests heavily in research and development, providing ample opportunities for engineers to work with state-of-the-art technologies. Diverse Work Environment: Samsung is a multinational company with a diverse workforce. Working with colleagues from different backgrounds and cultures was enriching, fostering a collaborative and inclusive work environment. I had the chance to collaborate with talented individuals and learn from their diverse perspectives. Professional Growth Opportunities: Samsung encourages employees to grow both personally and professionally. The company provides various training programs, workshops, and certifications to enhance technical skills and knowledge. Additionally, there are opportunities to work on cross-functional teams and explore different domains within the company, enabling career growth and development. Compensation and Benefits: Samsung offers competitive compensation packages, including salaries, bonuses, and benefits. The company values its employees and provides comprehensive healthcare coverage, retirement plans, and other perks. The compensation package was commensurate with the industry standards, ensuring a fair and rewarding experience.

Cons: In my experience, HR will back management and does not listen to the employee.
Advice: I would suggest to HR and especially to the head of HR to at least listen to the employee and not violate your own policies. Everything I said to management and HR was responded to with a "It doesn't matter".

The company new employee training includes a module on how to navigate theKorean binge drinking culture. You were expected to binge drink at company functions if you wanted to get ahead. The company culture is sexist. One example, I had a female colleague who was asked in an interview for a promotion "If you are selected for this promotion who will take care of your kids?" This is an awful place to work. I highly recommend seeking employment anywhere but Samsung.

Advice: None
Pros: Huge benefits and discounts offered

Cons: ...however their values get trashed by the culture which is about running around like a headless chicken, spinning wheels, doing things that don't really add any value just to look busy. Expertise is frowned upon in favour of just spinning wheels and wasting time on pointless leadership team appeasement. Empowerment non-existent in favour of box-ticking for leadership. Very little learning and development at all after the probation period. The epitome of that definition of madness where they just want to do the same thing over and again expecting a different result...but they never get it. Understanding of data and statistics is almost non-existent, with the rule being that it's only used to prove the opinion of the person using it, never to open up learning to inform action. Leadership team is an assortment of people from failed enterprises, not successful and market-beating ones. No internal job move opportunities unless you've been on the grad scheme, then it's a case of rolling out the red carpet. Made a big song and dance about having work-life balance but then those without kids or a significant interest in life outside the 8-6 set the tone for what's expected and aggressively hound those whose work isn't their life. Any expertise you offer will at best be slyly appropriated by the audience and no credit will be given to the source at all - this is the worst organisation I've ever been in for this sort of thing; at worst you'll be openly told off for daring to have an original thought.
Advice: None - it was all given during the time I was there and none of it
Pros: Ethnic diversity promoted there, and some good-natured people working there...

Cons: So many projects, but not enough Man-power.
Core members tend to be working too much.
Even though firing cases are not common, there are limitation of chances depend on age, like retirement age.
In Korean offices, Korean is used for most meetings and e-mails. It can be challenging for foreign workers.
Advice: None
Pros: Nice place for developing career. 
Tons of works to do if you want. Many chances if you have the will. Various educational chances.
Many experts in various fields in H/W and S/W. Can get kind help from them in many cases.
No fear of getting fired.
Enhances work-life balanced culture compared to the past.
One of the best salaries and benefits in Korea.

Cons: - Mentally prepare to see your hard work be destroyed by utterly incompetent local management, over and over again. - HQ leadership / mindset are very good, but often out of touch with what really goes on in this department. - Forget about career progression here, local management goal is to do as less as possible while getting away with it. If you oppose this mindset you will be targeted and gaslighted, they'll go far and wide to protect their little circle. - For these reasons this was by far the most toxic and depressing place I've personally ever worked, with reasonably crazy high turn-overs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You have been warned. That been said, my advice to you is: give it a shot and see how it goes, but always keep an opened mind and be ready to jump off.
Advice: Stop playing games or leave the chair to someone that knows what he's doing and he's willing to commit for the project and his team. Stop antagonizing HQ and talking behind their back, dumping on them the responsibility of your own failures. Stop the lies, manipulations and gatekeeping. Such behavior is not doing you any good, it promotes toxicity and ultimately will lead to your own downfall. Best of luck and farewell
Pros: - Interesting projects to work on - Good salary and benefits - Good name on your CV, but know what you're signing up for (see Cons)

Cons: Getting promoted is nearly impossible (there’s certain rules, like limiting the number of people to be promoted, etc). The salary increases, but not as much or as quickly as it should. Forced work from the office 3 times a week after work from home during covid had brought the company better results.
Advice: If there is a system to grade employees, but then you limit the amount of people that can be graded well (cause it implies promotion that is for only a few people), then it is not fair. People that do exceptional work are graded as “average” just because of this system. And there’s lots of very talented people in the AI team. Don’t force people to work from the office if they perform better working from somewhere else.
Pros: The jobs is very interesting most of the time, if you land good projects and have the initiative to take on challenging tasks. Lots of opportunities for development. Possibility of publishing papers at top NLP conferences. Great atmosphere. Brilliant engineers. Good benefits.

Cons: Following my internship experience, I've noticed a few cons associated with the company. These include limited opportunities for advancement, potential communication gaps between different departments, occasional heavy workload, and a lack of structured feedback during the internship. Additionally, the company's work processes could sometimes be inefficient, and there might be room for improvement in terms of diversity and inclusion efforts. It's important to note that these cons might vary based on individual experiences and perspectives.
Advice: None
Pros: After completing an internship at this company, I've identified several pros that make it stand out. The company offers valuable hands-on experience, a supportive and collaborative work environment, exposure to cutting-edge technologies, opportunities for skill development, and a strong emphasis on networking and professional growth. Additionally, the company's commitment to employee well-being and work-life balance is commendable, making it an appealing place to consider for future employment.

Cons: Almost impossible to teach this old dog new tricks. You don't have agility when it's needed.
Advice: None
Pros: quite stable, a good place to work if you plan to settle here.

Cons: Compared to other global companies, the salary isn’t competitive at all. People with qualifications that allow them to work in the US should seek for opportunities in the US. Even if you want to go higher up in the company, it’s easier if you have extensive experience in other global companies.
Advice: None
Pros: The benefits, salary are top notch for korea. They provide all three meals, a shuttle to work, many educational opportunities, great maternity leave, etc. You’ll never get fired (before executive level).

Cons: High bureacracy and no or less innovation.
Advice: The firm location is less attractive to many young graduates or industry experts who used to work at the finance centre, etc.
Pros: It’s the best place to work with a structured and well organised company system. It guarantees your employment as long as you work the required working hours.

Cons: Poor policies for consumers, requires breaking the bad news often, Having warranty on devices still causes consumers much stress. Company does not value service efforts Retail store and online store is seperate entity.

Cons: Samsung is the "big dog" in Korea, everyone wants to work there. It is a matter of honor to work there. So they work like slaves. They sleep at work under their desks as they are putting in 16 to 18 hr days regularly. If they get fired they won't easily get hired elsewhere. So they work incredibly hard and expect the same from everyone else. In Aus we have other options. What they do is not necessary. So they consider us lazy. I told them they are slaves. They hated me. They are 100% data-driven. It's not OK to hit 95% or even 105% you have to hit your target 100% every time. You get reviewed weekly, not monthly. If you can handle the stress it's fine. If not you won't last. If you can last though then other people know how tough Samsung is and you can get jobs easily elsewhere. They know you can handle.

Cons: This company is the reason I still have burnout after 2 years. Imagine having to do overtime work everyday and no weekends for 2 months straight just to deliver something that barely works. No rewards or anything even if you are one of the top contributor on the team, all you get is more work. This company is the perfect example for famous saying: "The reward for good work, is more work" The Korean counterparts always assigns deadlines even if they still have no clue what they want! Much worse is that our PH bosses / managers can barely do anything with that decision, they just seem to be middlemen from PH developers to Korean bosses.
