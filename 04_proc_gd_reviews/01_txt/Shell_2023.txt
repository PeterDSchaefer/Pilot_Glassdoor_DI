Cons: Nepotistic leadership chain that exists at every level throughout the company, both laterally and vertically Male dominated with not many women (at least on my former team) Also a decent amount of less-than talented individual contributors Redundant middle management Loads of wasteful meetings No career growth or structured development plans Less autonomy since the company was acquired by Shell
Advice: Ask yourselves: if I owned this company, who would I want to run it? Which individual contributors are worth keeping? The company could use an overhaul from the top down.
Pros: A decent amount of talented individual contributors Each product has their own unique challenges that make it fun

Cons: Increasingly difficult to move to new roles, company defines itself as an energy company, not an oil company...as if being an oil company for over 100 yrs is negative.
Advice: Oil started Shell, built you to what you are, and will be part of the world economy for decades to come.  Don't cut off you nose to spite your face...be an oil company.
Pros: Benefits, Recognized as as top tier employer so helps obtain future jobs.

Cons: Not enough wall outlets to use my george foreman grill to make lunch.
Advice: Please add more wall outlets, as this is an employees home away from home. Changing tables need to be checked by maintenance to see if repairs are needed on the drop-down wall units. This will ensure no children will be in danger and it also doubles as my dining area and is quite inconvenient when half of it is hanging off of the wall.
Pros: It sounds gross but i have learned so much because you can hear everything that goes on conversation wise in a rest room. The amount of people that use their phones while in the stall is amazing. Sure, they may wash their hands but that poor phone is covered in waste.

Cons: Pay is a little less compared to market, and growth is a little slow moving. Culture is very European - easy going, relaxed and chill.
Advice: None
Pros: My first company out of college, very relaxed and laid back, great work-life balance, work culture is amazing, people are lovely and supportive, great place to be.

Cons: The largest flaw I have experienced is by Shell placing leadership based on their education or outside experience. I recently received a poor IPF by a "new to Shell" manager because I did not lead like he led in the military. I achieved my goals and highest results in the department. Proved to HR and Employee Relations that I was discriminated against for not being like him. They recognized and acknowledged the unfair actions against me, but finally said 'HR does not have the ability to reverse the wrong done to you'. It cost me over 10k in my bonus, over $3,000 each year in my compounding salary and more in my pension when I retire. I received a punitive punishment based on confirmed discrimination and lack of diversity with zero desire for the business to make it right.
Advice: Treat your employees better! Be serious about discrimination (at all levels) and stop placing people in management because of their degree or military experience and give HR the power to 'right the wrongs' done in your organization. This protects management from discipline when they abuse frontline workers.
Pros: Great company, but like all they have their flaws.

Cons: You have to be willing to move to another location, after you reach certain seniority level, if you want to keep growing. It can also be pretty time demanding, which may compromise your work life balance Changes happen too often, leaving your energy drained. Constant reorganizations.
Advice: Every two years or so there is a reorganization. I understand the environment changes, and company needs to adjust, but unfortunately, it takes a lot of energy for employees to having to think constantly about reorganizations.
Pros: You can get work life-balance, if that is a priority for you You can still get good opportunities (with limited growth), if you can't move to another place Salary and benefits are really good. The longer you work, the more financial benefits you get through shares Opportunities are pretty dynamic, so it provides space for changing jobs and experience new areas, if that is what you are looking for

Cons: Regular restructuring within the businesses and functions. Global decisions on local assets, no local control.
Advice: Find ways to make more money not just cut expenses to be profitable. Respect your country and regional business personnel to understand their local business dynamics and communities.

Advice: None
Pros: Making strides with DE&amp;I. As a woman, I am generally happy working at Shell and have many male Allie’s too. The company is trying to be more gender and race diverse. It’s maybe slower than I’d like, but acknowledge that the larger the company the slower the change can be. I am constantly challenged and find my job very rewarding. I get to work on different projects so that keeps it interesting too. With the exception of one boss when I first started, I have had amazing and supportive bosses that are trying to help me be better at my job. The maternity and paternity leave policy is excellent too.

Cons: Several recent shifts in top-down decisions.
Advice: None
Pros: A strong culture that fosters career loyalty.

Cons: So much corporate politics and bureaucracy. Hard to get things done. Seems like there has been a "re-org" and layoffs every 2-3 years since 2015. Many high flying managers get shuffled around quickly and by the time they get to upper management, they haven't ever really stayed in any part of the business long enough to see all the cost cutting measures they took start to backfire. Continuous shift towards treating our projects and engineering/staff as a simple generic commodity that can be outsourced to shorter term contract workers, and HVEC (High Value Engineering Center) aka low cost places. IT and HR was completely gutted and outsourced, it's a nightmare now trying to get help from those support functions.
Advice: It's a dynamic industry, and some changes are anticipated, but be better about making plans and sticking to them. Otherwise employees won't put any faith in new plans each time they are rolled out. It's just "flavor of the month".
Pros: Pay is competitive for energy majors, being a European company they are a little more relaxed and better work life balance than what I've heard from others at US based energy majors. A big focus on safety and trying their best to do the right thing.

Cons: lack of care for employees
Advice: None
Pros: Opportunities to move in company. Good Pay

Cons: 1. Shrinking manufacturing foot-print 2. Not sufficient diversity at key leadership positions 3. Too many layers of management.

Cons: Shell needs to evolve and change as it makes its into the 21st century. I believe it'll be around for a while as it'll play a critical role in the energy transition. The scale of that role highly depends on a few things: 1) cease juggling many things all at once (anecdote: you're required to have 8 goals a year), 2) strict financial discipline, many many projects have negative value and fuzzy strategic value at best.

Pros: A self-managing problem solver would have a blast working here. Every day is different and challenging. The people are fun and smart.

Pros: Compensation and benefits are good

Cons: management was moody and not friendly and did not train people correct
Advice: train people and stop the attitude
Pros: easy work to perform once trained.

Cons: HR (read: someone in the Philippines whom you will never even have a phone conversation with) will put you wherever there is a "business need". Most of the time these departments and opportunities are pure garbage and are of little relevance to the future, your career trajectory and the company's bottom line. RIP skills. 

Because they just throw you wherever (and at little notice) this translates to you likely not having any experience working in the specific function, and at the same time you will not be supported/mentored to do the job correctly. I have been regularly working overtime and weekends without getting paid and I do not feel like I am getting any skills or experience, so I am hoping to leave soon. 

There have been surveys sent out to global new graduates in the program. The results are summarized:
- Majority leave before their 3 years, 
- &lt;40% were satisfied to have completed the program
- 20% rated their line managers as good/sufficient
Advice: Stop using 1 young person to do what it would take about 2-3 senior full-timers.  At least give me a raise!!
Pros: - Decent/Good Pay, Benefits, Retirement
- 1 of the only Oil and Gas Companies that wants to be seen as the World's Hip, Woke Energy Company (do what you will with the greenwashing and heavy investments into marketing, lol)

Cons: Busy month-end activities where overtime is expected (though this is common for finance departments even in other companies)
Cost-cutting (depends on which department you are in), therefore automation is encouraged which could also mean downsizing
Annual salary increase is low and even if you are promoted, increase is still low (around 8-10% only)
Base salary compared to other BPO companies is relatively low.
Promotion takes time - each employee has a 4-year window in their current role before they can be promoted. You can be promoted within 1-2 years if you have an exceptional talent or skill, or if you are a lead's favorite.
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of benefits - medical, 13th and 14th month pay, choice pot (20K annual allowance for all employees to encourage work-life balance e.g. hotel reservations, flight tickets, medicine, gym membership, workout apparels, etc.)
Performance bonus and salary increase annually
Annual Leave - 17 days VL for employees less than 10years, 15 days sick leave (convertible to cash every January), and 5 days emergency leave
Easy to request for leaves, though this still depends on your manager
Hybrid set-up (2 days mandatory in the office)
Since it is a BPO and multinational company, you get to work with plenty of foreign stakeholders.

Cons: - Bad trainings - there is not a structured training, onboarding pack has limited information. A lot of pressure to achieve an high performance even when you are not trained accordingly. - Meetings with your TL feel like you are being in a room with KGB. After 1.5 months of working, with limited training, you are already told that your contract might not be renovated. Destructive Feedback with a goal to intimidate and not to teach or help improving. - Most of the time the meetings would be conducted not only by a TL but also by one of the seniors, who has been made senior through "politics" as it is not possible to pass from a junior to a senior within 2 years. Several other colleagues with very high scores took that amount of time to pass from a junior to an analyst. It felt like the TL needed some help passing the message or was trying to use an extra hand to intimidate. If you defend yourself they ask you for proof like if you are lying. - Toxic and stressful environment to work as your jobs is constantly micromanaged not only by the TL but by other older colleagues. -TL yelling during meetings and sending emails saying you are making other people uncomfortable in the team with no explanation to why. - Lack of appreciation for the work you put in and extra hours. These are not even paid.
Advice: None
Pros: - annual bonuses - if you are lucky, some of your team mates are nice .

Cons: 1) Shell have a disappointing habit of hiring serious and successful professionals from the sector and then dis-empowering them. It is very hard to succeed with the combination of clunky IT, overly heavy process that crushes innovation, and deep layers of politics to navigate. 

2) Toxic environment created in electricity trading department. One red flag was when a very senior person said “people without mortgages are of no interest to me”. The implication was worrying and intimidating, with the behaviors displayed in the months to follow confirming the fears.

3) I was threatened and indirectly accused of intending to steal IP on the phone the day I resigned, by the same senior leader. It was a very upsetting way to finish my role and justified my decision to resign before securing a new role to move to yet.

4) The toxic management style lead to high stress, not conducive to innovation, happiness, or success. Not how forward thinking organisations should think about leadership.
Advice: Leadership change needed. The very senior management should note the obvious red flags and take action to remove dangerous senior staff members. Make a serious investment in IT. Foster a culture that allows your stars to demonstrate their excellence. Make a proper commitment to decarbonisation.
Pros: Good pension benefits and there are some good professional people.

Cons: Shell works on a top-down corporate culture with only senior managers expected to speak and be listened to in meetings.

Very little of business value appears to get delivered and nobody cares. 

Shell seem to think that cutting costs by offshoring and paying the profits out to shareholders is the height of their ambitions now that oil &amp; gas is out of favour. So they hire technical staff that are bad at their jobs but are cheap. Pretty much everybody in IDT delivery below management are now Indian. Once in a position of power, they make sure they only hire Indians.
Advice: None. They're past caring and I've no illusions that they'll listen
Pros: WFH is common dependent on which team you're in
When you go to the office, Shell Centre is a good location and the subsidised restaurant &amp; cafes are excellent.
Work hours are fine

Work hours are fine

Cons: The ceo wael has one goal. A big payout for him and the board. The focus for him is: # Cut costs as the consequences take time to show and he'll jump ship before hand. Similar to the Peter Voser era # Forgetting the environment, as oil is highly profitable #Cut staff whilst telling those remaining they have to work harder without extra pay to increase profits and keep pay rises below inflation #promote woman to hit D and I targets even if they are inexpw # Move jobs offshore to India, Poland and The Philippines where Labour is cheaper and they have very few employment protections # Promote the loudest and most aggressive people to managers # Down grade job requirements and put in junior staff who don't have the experience # Pay VP and above extremly well to keep the old boy network happy # Make staff fly economy but don't sell off the three corporate jets for the board and VPs
Advice: Some advice Reward staff and treat them like humans. You made nearly $0.5m profit per employee and hit $40b profits. Stop with the greed and remember your staff! Men are not the enemy. Stop treating them as such!
Pros: It pays the bills Home work

Cons: Time-zone different between the team you are in and the business you supporting Too many layers at management level Company core values (Honesty, Integrity &amp; Respect to People) usually only rhetoric instead of actual practices Office politic is real - people who proven exceptionally do the work well were let go and people who have no idea what the work is selected to secure the role Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DE &amp; I) is another rhetoric which favoritism happened at all levels
Advice: Management should walk the talk. Act accordingly to company core values. Choose the right person which possess good leadership skills to be a line manager / team leader / supervisor One culture concept should be followed across companies around the globe as long as it is not against local policies &amp; regulations. Plan wisely before any decision regarding redundancy be made to ensure to avoid lost of good/great talents which somehow will cost you more to find other talents externally, provide training, etc.
Pros: Good place to learn &amp; enhance technical knowledge &amp; skills Good work-life balance (depending on the team you are in) Good benefits to support wellbeing and mental health Great supports from stakeholders (depending on the team you are in) Salary benchmarking happened quite frequent A lot of organizational events to provide employees with adequate knowledge &amp; information on what happened within organization

Cons: Minorities and women have a glass ceiling set at the beginning when you join, you aren't aware of it, it a job group level e.g. 4, 3, or even lower. You get cheated in the term, because when you join your eyes are on the salary and you pay little attention to the job group. Where as the job group is your LIFE in Shell. Once set it is IMPOSSIBLE to revise, forget about the blabla of it is possible, it is not. To move from one job group to another you need 3 to 4 to even 5 years in a job (mostly 3), if you get cheated you'll never make it to any top position, because there is an even worse thing whicih is the estimated job group at retirement, even tah gets assigned, you have NO say, so for minorities and women the estimated JG at retirement is set at maximum 3, which means never reach any position of value. Shell is only for the English and Dutch and fellow white anglosaxons. Don't believe me? go waste a couple of decades of your life in Shell to find out.
Advice: None
Pros: Marble reception, but I guess it wasn't meant for me.

Cons: Mediocre pay, heavy bureaucracy, culture slowly becoming like a service company, reorgs every 2 years, delayed career progression, lethargic HR, no challenging work, over focus on visibility, unclear strategy, overall very bloated and inefficient.
Advice: It's good that the focus is back on performance. Avoid reshape every couple of years. Kindly rethink on making it attractive for talented people to stay back. The pay benchmark is done with service companies and you will only get talent that are mediocre. The HR really needs to get their act together. Reduce favouritism and bias.
Pros: Global outlook, good work life balance, safety culture, you get to be part of teams working on big problems like energy transition.

Cons: None. You are the best Shell
Advice: Keep up!
Pros: This is the best oil and gas company which i have been working with. I have been with other major oil and gas company inc the one and only Malaysian famous who always been talked about ( but rest assure, the book is prettier outside rather than looking the real truth inside) The team always walk the talk. Taking diversify and inclusivity seriously. The perks and compensations are the best. The management is always the leader team who helps the team to carry the mission together, and aids if team need their helps. Composition of the team is geolocation, where you will adapt the best mixed cultural working environment with less political office impact. I always love this company, the team, the management.

Cons: Minimum wage, Slow Shell App which makes for a longer queue and can make customers irate. No staff discount or perks, Supervisor only get 20p extra per hour and that's only paid for the time in office doing banking not even for the whole shift.
Advice: With all the billions of profit you make I am sure you could give your staff and store managers some sort of discount.
Pros: Every shift is like running your own business, trusted to be able to get on with the job and not be micro managed. Help and support if you need it no matter what time of day. I thought I would only stay there to make some money get me through the Covid-19 pandemic, 3 years later I'm still there. I have some amazing regular customers who make up for the not so pleasant. I have worked with two colleagues who are now station mangers so the opportunities are there if you work hard and you want it.

Cons: I have worked for a few of shell retail Franchises over the years and there pretty much all the same. You are on your own for 99% of your time and expected to do the work of 3 people for basic wage (no extra for nights). New starters are left on there own far to soon with only the bear minimum of training and just expected to know what they are doing. One of Shells mottos is Go Home Well, 9 times out of 10 you don't. Summary Salary = Minimum wage ( cash loses come out as well) Benefits = NONE Management = Do the best they can (Franchisee in control) Job work-life balance = If you can get set shifts you will be ok, but good luck with that. Job security = If you show up you will be ok. Advancement = You can ask then ask again still will not get you anywhere. Job culture = Bad ( If by chance any one from shell retail upper management reads this, Please look more closely in to your Franchise's ) In all honesty if you go for a interview just ask these 2 question's, what is the the hourly rate and if it lone working. If the answers are Minimum and yes walk away.
Advice: None
Pros: If you show up you will be ok.

Cons: - salary and benefits are not commensurate with the job and responsibilites - Job group here is smaller compare to other Shell; smaller salary - old plant. fragile and hard to maintain. ex: the plant can trip due to lightning. - high workload, low manpower/staff - some of the bosses/managers still micromanaging
Advice: - add more manpower/staff due to high workload - stop micromanaging - management to be more "efficient" in decision making
Pros: - work life balance - flexible supervisor/manager - way less toxic compare to when I joined - no harassments. super sensitive. 1 email away you can be in trouble.

Cons: Too less salary, people who dont want to work and get okay okay salary. No exposure to asset, limited growth opportunities, within company as a company employee you get contractor treatment. Too bad quality of people.
Advice: Hire good people and they will come at a price. Stop looking at structural benefits, use talent in India wisely
Pros: Work culture, no issues in holidays

Cons: Some times the size and scale can feel overwhelming which is always a good learning
Advice: None
Pros: Shell is a wonderful employer which provides great compensation and also cares for its employees health. There is notion that it is an energy company scope IT is limited but that is not the case at all. There is alot of innovation going on which make it an excellent place to work

Cons: Looking for career advancements which I'm at top level besides owning the company. No raises or bonuses have been given. No benefits. Searching for a new career that is different and room for expanding further knowledge.
Advice: I understand that prices have increased and business has slowed down. I don't agree with cutting my income to almost half to save costs by the owner working at his own business is going to be beneficial. Especially when not knowing how to operating the functions for the register, or speaking fluent English. I've provided regular customer business on a personal level of interaction. Business will surely decrease significantly if my presence is reduced by the drastic measures taken.
Pros: Developed a personal level of customer service. Job requirements are basic for job position. Secure employment. Work independently. Able to manage the schedule to fit my needs.

Cons: Change of organization happens like every other 5 years. Some employee opt to be out- mostly stays. No retirement benefit. most of the role is at Night shift
Advice: None
Pros: Hybrid set up. Competitive Salary and benefit. HMO covers immediate family, 70% is shared by the company. 24 hrs job available - high ay for night diff/sat pay. love the culture

Cons: If you are used to be in a hectic schedule and like that way of working, then the peace here would be a con.
Advice: Have business leadership roles based out of India to fill the only gap in your diversity agenda
Pros: The people are trained and educated to be nice to each other

Cons: The remuneration gift for employees’ long service (5/10/15 years etc) is very little
Advice: Shell needs to revisit its long service awards and reconsider what would be fair
Pros: Shell takes care of its workers first! I have a good life balance, and a manager that constantly makes efforts to remove obstacles

Cons: Strange structure of moving people to new roles every four years, like in the military. Your boss also has too much say in which role you get next and you need their permission to move on, which they can easily deny.
Advice: None
Pros: Nice people who are very hardworking.

Cons: Have to wait or reapply to new position to get career growth ( not merit based once inside with first job) - can feel stuck in lower salary grades unless you initially got in to the right job grade match of your experience.
Advice: None
Pros: Can be at your own comfort level - If you like to push the boundaries, you are welcome but no pressure or merit reward to be expected to do so.

Cons: Below market starting salary, there is no way to play catch up no matter how good your performance is as it the same increment throughout the same grade you are at (L5 to L9). Can be demoralizing during the first few years. Some experienced hires with less than 3-5 years experience (no panel) already higher basic than those working for over 10 years.
Advice: Stop the same grade pay increment, incentivise those that are of higher performance. Imagine a slacking &gt;20yrs experience tech getting the same increment as a &lt;5yr tech who give it all. Over time, people will just start to slack since there is no incentive to perform at all and all will get the same pay increment.
Pros: good salary and benefits + high OT rate

Cons: Single manned garage where everything is your responsibility in that shift, things go wrong on the daily and you have 10 other moving parts of the day you are trying to deal with at the one time, customers, the pumps needing ok'd, the coffee machine needing topped up, delivery's coming in and needing put away, health and saftey for everyone on site. It is alot for one person and causes you alot of stress. I also didn't get any breaks or could barley go to the toilet on an 8 hour shift, you are also expected to stay on if the next person doesn't show up regardless of what you have going on in your life. I really did dislike working here. Also you have to work Christmas and new years day.
Advice: Do away with 24hr single manned garages and check in with your franchise owners to see how they are doing, also a direct link to shell for staff would be beneficial as sometimes they feel they have no where to turn too if other routes fail.
Pros: Got paid for public holidays is about it.

Cons: Has a 4 year limit for every role, after which you are forced to find and change the team.
Advice: None
Pros: Love the management style
Loved the Team
Loved the ideas we build and solutions we delivered
Encouraging culture

Cons: Technology wise little outdated. Although its a Product base company but the methodology is similar to Service based company.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance. Focuses more on employees safety and their well being.

Cons: - Cost cutting measure - No budget for team building activities - Part of SBO, won't have same salary structure as other offices or bonus.
Advice: - Budgets need not be cut for cost centres especially team building activities.
Pros: - WLB - Professional colleagues - Great Benefits. MYR4.5k Total for optical/dental/wellness. As someone who has bad eyesight, my precriptions can go above MYR1.5k easily - Hybrid working and remote working available

Cons: if you join as contractor, and project gets over, they might release you within a month with no further notification. getting permanent is very difficult.
Advice: Please consider the contractor. In shell there are opening, instead you look for outside people, try to fill the position with contractors who has done best to the company
Pros: Good company
work life balance

Cons: Shady organization. The company's communication leaves much to be desired, often operating in a rather opaque manner. Decisions are made with a strong influence from individuals with backgrounds in the oil and gas industry, which do not align with the goal of fostering a cleaner future. Furthermore, a recent shift in strategy has led to the unfortunate situation of letting go of talented professionals recently hired from the renewable energy and decarbonization sector. Going in the wrong direction of the world!
Advice: Respect people. Change in the strategy means change in people's life, the minimum you should do is clear communication. HR contact is an automated email with machine responses. Avoid hiring employees only to reverse decisions shortly afterward. This company needs to treat both its employees and the environment with greater respect.
Pros: Salary and financial benefits are the only pros.

Cons: High-Stress Periods: During peak hours or busy times, the job can be stressful as you may have to handle a large number of transactions and manage impatient customers, which can be challenging
Advice: None
Pros: Working as a cashier at a Shell gas station allows you to interact with a diverse range of customers, providing an opportunity to develop strong communication and customer service skills.

Cons: Things can feel slow and progression definitely slower than big4. But it’s a choice
Advice: None
Pros: Good structure, work life balance and benefits

Cons: - Promotion takes a lot of time for quite a lot of folks and at times you need to keep pushing for it, which is very annoying. Everyone gets similar feedback from Line Managers saying you need to improve your visibility other than the work you do. - Salary structure could be better. Very little scope for saving on taxes - Some people get Market Correction on their CTC while others don't
Advice: - Please make the promotion cycles shorter and - Discriminatory Market Corrections are demotivating for other deserving candidates who don't get it. - Bring in more flexibility for people to move to different roles from IT to Business or vice-versa - Please improve the salary structure, so that in-hand could be improved. On Paper it looks inflated while in-hand after taxes is nowhere near - Please allow employees to jump to a different range of salary in the same job group
Pros: - Good work-life balance - Large organization so there are opportunities to move around, but mostly within IT - With leadership drive to shift towards a product mindset, Application delivery teams have autonomy and they work very closely with the business

Cons: Limited resources in terms of company benefits
Advice: Help provide work benefits to staff
Pros: Will be treated fairly by the firm and other staff

Advice: None
Pros: One of the best qualities is work culture

Cons: small salary, no possibility for growth in the company , discrimination when it comes to promotions , if the line manager is not agree to let you go - you can't move to another department, no change in the salary till I was part of the company at all , your professional opinion mean nothing to the company no matter how much years you spent working the same job, very strange company rules for some things, lies on the job interviews and empty promises /ask everything to be in written form/, polish currency is not constant value and you should be aware that no matter what they promise in euro you will not earn this, very frequently reject to pay for training and a lot of other things
Advice: Start care about your employees. Stop discrimination: for example I've made a check from 15 promotions for one month that I was informed 12 were for polish guys 2 for polish speakers and only 1 for foreigner. On my exit interview I told to the HR that if I quit and after 1 month apply for manager they will agree to sign me , but they do not agree at the current moment to make an offer and the HR representative agreed with this and said that it is totally possible having in mind my background.

Cons: Frequent re-organisations and decision-making speed varies greatly across the businesses
Advice: Set clear targets, not only direction

Advice: Get real on workloads and how thinly you want to spread staff Get real on EDI (in the 16 years I was there the % or women leaders barely changed despite all the fantastic work on EDI)

Advice: None
Pros: -Work life balance
-Good salary
-Good peers

Cons: Little career advancement opportunities, especially in the technical space. People who perform well typically get stuck in their role with poor reasons given not to promote them. Prefer to bring in expat than promote locals who are more than qualified. Fast career progression depends on who you know, even if you are not a performing employee. Salary package is good for the role, but not for the years of experience. People with tons of experience are unable to move up the career ladder. HR is blind to all these as they are only concerned with benchmarking for the role.
Advice: Give more opportunities and consideration to locals. Stop thinking locals can't do the job because more often than not, they can do it better than the expat you bring in.

Very pro-female which is great for me - i just need to make lots of noise, be self-entitled and the company will provide.

Cons: Poor Management, new CEO is only focused on increasing shareholders' profits
Too much politics
Hateful comments by colleagues and managers, some colleagues are liars, in fact most of them, some of them even become proxy-managers. Shame!

Listen to your real talents.
Diversify the business
