Cons: The foreign work culture is a lot of the time very disrespectful to the American citizen. You are treated like you are less than, if you rank under others. Was told in daily basis that work is more important than home/family life. Paid time off /vacation and sick time are the same. Even with doctor statement you are still punished on point system. Have to give 24 hours notice to use PTO or sick time and avoid punishment points. Very little off time work 6 days every week no matter what. They never promote from within. Very disrespectful to employees. Everyone is overworked and exhausted all the time. High turnover rate.
Advice: Just try to care about your employees a little. Give them a reason to want to stay. Start promoting from within and give your people a chance. Try to lead by example and not rule with fear.
Pros: Great Benefits. Not a physically demanding job. Depending on where you work average pay.

Cons: Systems and processes are outdated, hard to have any type of work/life balance. Communication from management is poor. Leadership made a poor decision to move the mobile headquarters from NYC to TX and lost great talent, causing big headaches to replace. More work for everyone and low morale. Culture values face time in office over productivity.
Advice: None
Pros: Hard working culture, challenging, never boring, some fun events if your boss allows you to participate, great health insurance, HR benefits are competitive (if allowed to use them). People are  good for most part.

Cons: Very stressful

Work long 20+ hour days, several days a week

The expectation is that you get everything done, it doesn’t matter how it impacts you or how much you’ve already been assigned

No negotiation or give and take, just GET IT DONE

Work-life balance isn’t a thing

Poor people culture
Advice: Hire many many many more people. It is not okay to drive employees into the ground, just because you give them a paycheck. 

Develop a standard for the people culture and actually care about the well being of your employees.
Pros: Great base pay 

Big bonuses 

Learn a ton about project management and working for a large company

Great exposure to senior leadership

They send you new devices with every launch

Cons: Processes are out of date. Communication and clear expectations between parties is some of the worst I've seen. For one of the biggest tech companies, they use wildly behind the times software (they care more about the bottom line than the user experience is my guess at why they purchase such bad products) Company culture is just, bad. It's dead silent in any sort of capacity where we're supposed to be spur ideas/give feedback.
Advice: Listen more than you talk. Value other's ideas - you'll have a more dynamic and brighter workplace and deliverables.
Pros: Honestly there a few great people who are very smart. But move on quickly.

Cons: HR leadership. The leadership fails in every way possible. Racism exist but even when you go to the top it's still not being recognized that things need to change.
Advice: My advice is take a look at  management and inside the heart of your company's Human Resources. It's interesting that even if you call the hotline or bring notice to the racism nothing will be done.   Those that are put in place to help employees deal with these things make empty promises. I was told that my incident would be looked into by the Employee Relations leader in Frisco Texas and she never checked into it. It was almost like she was avoiding me because she never followed up.  No matter how I tried to bring light to what was going on regarding HR nothing got done.  I was not the only victim there where several of us being overlooked and being denied the opportunities that our white peers were given.   What's interesting is I was warned by the very person that hired me. She ended up leaving the company for the very reason I'm posting this.  She had a master's degree in human resources, SHRM certification, not to mention several years of experience.  They hired someone that didn't have her credentials but had the right skin tone "white".  This most agregious thing was being a person with several degrees, experiences and being passed up by those that didn't have close to my Background or education. At every turn they came up with excuses as to why they would not hire me nor those that look like me. Samsung has a very high turn around rate in HR because of this reason right here.  The most interesting part was I was told that this happens over and over and over again yet nothing has been done. It's very disconcerting to now that in 2020 you're still being discriminated against because of the color of your skin. It's very ugly when you do everything you can to shine a light on it but still it keeps going and being ignored. So the hotline doesn't nor does employee relations doesn't work so what's next? What I experienced was them trying to hurry up and get rid of me. My advice deal with human resources leadership start from the top and work your way down and you will see.
Pros: I don't have any to share

Cons: The worst company culture I've ever experienced, seen or heard of. You will be worked to the bone. No balance at all. Ever. And forget about any onboarding, development, tools or resources. You will be provided with nothing and expected to navigate the most outrageous hurdles at the same time. 

Additionally be prepared for toxic people in the masses. Not just one or two.... most. Including leaders and HR. Everyone had been conditioned to back stab, manipulate and tear each other down. And you can't trust HR or ER to do anything about it. There has been sexual harrasment, code of conduct violations and serious discrimination especially against women. HR knows about it and brushes it off. And In some cases they even participate in it. No urgency. No concern. No action. 

Micromanagement is constant from all levels. You will be handcuffed and expected to run around like a chicken with your head cut off on the least impactful and most meaningless work. Dont expect to enjoy any PTO either. You are always on. Unless you are a low performing dirt bag. Then you will be protected and allowed to make everyone miserable with your terrible attitude all while everyone that is decent and hardworking is expected to do your work.

Everyone will try to place blame on Korea but the reality is you just have a cesspool of nasty, inept and terrible people at one place with no accountability.
Advice: You need an overhaul of your HR, ER and legal department. They are TERRIBLE. They are inept. Most don't even have real HR/ER backgrounds or experience and legal is too busy covering for the misfits and the "risk" they might present to care about the high performing individuals. 

You can't be employee centric when the only employees you care about are low performers and despicable characters. 

Get it together Samsung.

Cons: I read in previous reviews that the atmosphere at Samsung Staines is very toxic. Some have said that they had bad experience working with people of Indian origins. 

I don't generalize, but my experience working in a team where the majority were of Indian origin was not good. I felt there is a lot favoritism and pressure. Hindi is the main language (we're living in England). They use their mother tongue as a language of exchange, so that you don't understand. You feel you're there, but outside what is happening. A complete dilemma.

The team lead is very rude and offensive. I had to report him to the HR, but I did not do. I don't like to report. I joined the company to work and promote the business.

Finally, a European R&amp;D should receive people with a research background. People who have validated their degree in Europe or got an equivalent of the degree they hold.
Advice: Some people at the HR are also not honest. I advise the HQ or the the higher management in Staines to take a look on what is happening inside the teams. I advise the higher management also to check if the HR are not selective, discriminatory. A person there (I don't mention their name) has made my arrival very hard, leaving me without badge for 4 days. I could not access the business and I had to borrow other people's badge or wave someone to let me in.
Pros: I rate Samsung very high because I like this company and the effort they do. I had very good relation with the HQ, the VP and the directors.

Cons: Contractors and Permanent staff getting treated differently with training, going to summer and Christmas events.

Really bad career progression.

Manager hasnt really bothered taking time hiring quality staff.

Zero experience staff joining the company at higher rank and higher salary
Advice: Its really bad to see staff members been put through there paces to apply for promotion or managerial role only to find someone with no training experience, no relevant background been put forward to a higher management position. Only because they knew someone higher in the company to be put forward for the role. Dont be surprised if you see someones, friend, husband or wife join the company only because they wanted the money and not the job. This hasnt once, its happen multiple times.

Internal recruitment and HR have to put up with it and then having to give some long winded speech on why they are better then you. HR and internal recruitment are just bad people and they will fold down to upper management to decide who enters Samsung. 
Its really embarrassing and I feel bad for some of the more highly talented people I worked with to hear them say that to me. Unfortunately, nine times out of ten, they would just leave and find better jobs who respect there talent rather then who they know in the company.

Samsung can make the company better but because the work culture in some departments is basically: “No one cares what you think”. Theres no point in working in such harsh conditions.
Theres a also a bully culture at Samsung which again, why no one speaks about it? Its simple: HR doesnt care and wont do anything about it. 

Enjoy working with talentless people.
Pros: Some good people to work with

Samsung looks nice on your CV

Cake day
