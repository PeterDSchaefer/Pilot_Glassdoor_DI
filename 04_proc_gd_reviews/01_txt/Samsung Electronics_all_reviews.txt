Advice: SCI score is a joke, why have it if nothing changes?  Fix your VP leadership before you lose another 10% in business, they are only there collecting paychecks
Pros: Pay and bonus structure is nice, along with health benefits.

Cons: worst management I've ever seen. Run by Korea who has no idea how to market in US.
Advice: hire competent people
Pros: they pay well and good benefits

Cons: Micromanagement
Paying women less than male counterparts (ITS SHOCKING WHY HAVENT JPURNALISTS LOOK INTO - women anre treated like dirt and they are systematically not promoting them.  Samsung will not do accommodations if you have a disability.  and It will probably end your employment there if you do so.  Please don’t work there. It destroyed my career. 
Advice: You need a better HR department because they would be SCREAMING into the phone trying to get me to quit while my son was having an MRI.  I’m a great engineer and had a stellar record.  I hope things have changed but I doubt it.  The pay difference between men and women for even the woman doing more work was shocking.

Advice: None
Pros: * worked with fantastic and knowledgeable team

Cons: Most toxic working environemnt Untrustworthy leadership, teams that are only out for themselves, willing to backstab anyone to try and take credit for tasks or projects. Systems and technology are beyond subpar using outdated laptops, Microsoft products from 2014 and 2016, with any new opportunities to enhance systems immediately denied.
Long, thankless hours and completely unreasonable expectations are the norm.
No one is allowed to actually succeed or truly grow and bonuses are all based on a quota system no matter how well you perform.
If you love being the scapegoat for poor management, lack or any type of clear guidelines, and a delusional Korean HQ, you will thrive at Samsung
Advice: 
Pros: Pros are all talk. Any claims you see of "people first organization", "flexible working days or hours", "work life balance" are all BS.
Trauma bonding with co-workers is fun.

Advice: When you don't match the type of work to the type of employer, dissatisfaction creeps in and turnover increases. If you continue to hire engineers and don't empower them to use their brains and problem solving skills but instead use them to inspect parts, you will continue to lose them.

Advice: None
Pros: Team, respect for employees, future prospects

Cons: Strict technology policy. You can't bring a personal laptop and your phone if you get their "Proprietary" software inhibits most functions on your phone. Your phone is your only real gateway to anything outside of the company. Everything is tracked heavily from where you badge in and out of, to the websites you look at if you are bored. Lastly, the biggest con in my opinion, is the company is massively "Woke". Guys can't say anything in any joking manner without looking over their shoulder like the policy police are out to get them fired. This is not an exaggeration. As a result, I never talk to anyone outside of people I absolutely have to for business reasons.
Advice: Stop being political in your corporate policies and allow people actual freedom of speech.
Pros: Overall the company is good at compensating the employee. Seems like there is always someone getting food for some type of reason. GWP as they call it. Being salary, there is no issue submitting for extra pay when you come in extra although it's capped at 300 per occurrence. This depends on job grade. Lower job grades salary is 150 per occurrence. The people in my immediate group are all pretty good it seems. Although this might be slanted because I am in management and don't see what the average worker sees.

Cons: Workload and Deadlines: Like many technology companies, Samsung operates in a fast-paced environment, often demanding tight deadlines and high workloads. This can sometimes lead to work-life balance challenges and periods of intense pressure. However, with effective time management and prioritization, it is possible to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Bureaucracy: As a large organization, Samsung has a certain level of bureaucracy, which can occasionally slow down decision-making processes. Navigating through various layers of management and getting approvals for certain initiatives can be time-consuming. However, the company has been actively working to streamline processes and improve efficiency. Limited Autonomy: In certain cases, as a software engineer, I felt that decision-making authority was concentrated at higher levels within the organization. This limited the level of autonomy and ownership I had over certain projects. However, this can vary depending on the team and project, and it's important to proactively communicate and collaborate with colleagues and supervisors to influence decision-making processes.
Advice: None
Pros: Technological Advancements: Samsung is at the forefront of technological advancements, and as a software engineer, I had the chance to work on exciting projects that pushed the boundaries of innovation.

Diverse Work Environment: Samsung is a multinational company with a diverse workforce. Working with colleagues from different backgrounds and cultures was enriching, fostering a collaborative and inclusive work environment. I had the chance to collaborate with talented individuals and learn from their diverse perspectives. Professional Growth Opportunities: Samsung encourages employees to grow both personally and professionally. The company provides various training programs, workshops, and certifications to enhance technical skills and knowledge. Additionally, there are opportunities to work on cross-functional teams and explore different domains within the company, enabling career growth and development. Compensation and Benefits: Samsung offers competitive compensation packages, including salaries, bonuses, and benefits. The company values its employees and provides comprehensive healthcare coverage, retirement plans, and other perks. The compensation package was commensurate with the industry standards, ensuring a fair and rewarding experience.

Cons: I was a project leader for almost two years and i strongly recommend people to stay away from Samsung Research America, specially researchers due to the following reasons.

1. There is no independence and everything needs to be approved by HQ in South Korea. Upper management in South Korea thinks in terms of hardware and they do not understand software. They are old people with poor understanding of technology and all decisions are taken based on what other US companies are publicly doing

2. People from HQ steal many project ideas as they need to approve them. They will say "please do not work on this item idea because we are already working on it at HQ". Then, they will ran back to HQ and create a project based on your idea or team idea. HQ stole to big projects from my team in just two years.

3. Similarly HQ will also steal the patents generated by you or your team and i have known some instances in which patents submitted from usa to south korea for approval come back with different author names.

4. Finally, since all funding comes from HQ your managers at Samsung research america (usa) will be powerless after all the abuses you suffer. 

In summary, Samsung is a follower company, following the work of leading companies such as apple and this is so embedded in their culture that they even follow and steal ideas from each other within the company.

Stay away please if you are an independent and innovative researcher. Join n american company or startup in the bay area better. You will regret joining and you will remember my advise.
Advice: Gain independence from HQ approvals and behave in n ethical manner

Corporate culture favors Koreans over American counterparts
People constantly leaving for other companies, sometimes for less pay, no continuity
Organization and management is very immature and rife with "boot-licking"

Need to do a better job of retaining talent and removing incompetent managers (here's a hint: if people are constantly leaving an organization or team then maybe its worth exploring the reasons why)
Pros: Pay is above average
Health benefits are good
401k match at 5%

Cons: Long hours and very high pressure. The Korean culture requires the appearance of high dedication, and is reliant upon assigning blame and punishment for any failure.

Cons: Korean American culture can be difficult and challenge
Advice: None
Pros: If you have any previous related experiences, it will be not too difficult.

Cons: The base salary is relatively low. The management and company culture are notorious bad. They exploit employee to contribute patent to company. It counts into your half-year assessment which is the reference for your bonus. As I have mentioned, their base salary is low, but their bonus may not be bad. Their the manager controls substantial portion of your yearly income, and that will serve a great leverage for the manager to exploit the employee.

Another thing is that their company IT is notoriously poor. For example, my current American company outsources the IT architecture to professional IT service vendor (such as Citrix). When you got some trouble on your PC, all you need to do is to make a phone call to the help desk, and you quickly get a professional IT service to fix your computer. Nonetheless, in Samsung, fixing your own PC is a part of your skill in your work. You have to fix your own PC or you will be treated incompetence. The group which I worked for in Samsung does have a Korean IT guy. However, he acted like your boss. You have to beg him to fix your PC or your may have to wait for a long time, and you may not finish your job because of that. Your manager won't listen to your "excuse" saying that you could not finish your work on time because your PC has some issue. blah blah blah ...
Advice: None
Pros: Samsung is famous. You may have a chance to get free Android devices. Although their base salary is relatively low comparing to the main stream American companies, their compensation is not bad and their base salary is still higher than many Asian companies, such as Foxconn, Huawei, Supermicro, or ASUS etc.

Cons: If you're part of the ♻️ team it can get really hot out there, so drink a lot of water.
Advice: Keep doing what y'all are doing.
Pros: Very professional. Really nice people work there.

Cons: The opportunities for growth as far as promotion and actual recognition of increased duties has been next to nil. I have increased my duties ten fold since I started, yet make the same pay and have the same title when I started. Every time I add a new skill or service, it becomes part of my job requirements. Three years have passed and I am still considered 'contract', lacking any benefits. The frustration mounts when new hires are brought on as 'full time' from the start. Being expected to help them with deliverables to fulfill their annual bonus only adds to the sense of unfairness. Although I am appreciative for working here, too many things make me wonder if there are better opportunities.
Advice: Try to recognize that we can't run as a skeleton crew. Having more than one person with similar skills helps spread the work load and adds to creative collaboration. As it is, we tend to work in a creative vacuum, leading to inefficiency.
Pros: This is a great place to grow experience with plenty of duties to fill. Everyone needs to be well-rounded, filling multiple roles, which tend to multiply over time. My job today is nothing like the job description when I was hired, which has led to an expanding portfolio to showcase of my design, video and multimedia works. My role keeps growing which is nice, since it tends to give better job security. 
Working in marketing is also nice with the many interesting and fun programs and sponsorships we do. It's definitely something good to put on the resume having worked for Samsung.

Cons: Very bad payment per year
Advice: Just trying to keep improving
Pros: Very good environment office place

Cons: Unless you know the Korean language, you can't get far within the company. HQ folks look down on you and rotational staffs don't care about you.  Environment was bad- low morale where EVERYONE wanted to quit the company. Although you may be hired under a certain position, you are expected to do many many things outside your position. It's good to get diverse experience, but you will never become good at any one thing.  Compensation was so low that it made me feel like I wasn't worth much despite all the hard work I put in. There was lack of appreciation and too many comments that were borderline harassment- "your arms are thick", "it looks like you need to lose a few more pounds", etc.... Although I learned a lot during my time there, I am glad to have left.
Advice: All the management are rotational staffs from Korea. I know that management will be here for a short period: 3-5 years but management should be involved more with the local staff instead of doing their own things. Also, the way management treats Korean speaking American staff members is different from the way management treats non-Korean speaking American staff members. Management tends to overwork the Korean speaking American staff members and compensate them less than their non-Korean speaking counterparts who do less work. What is up with that?
Pros: Benefits are good- health, dental, vision, subsidized lunches, gym membership, 401k, and education. Global network and a good name to have company pride.

Advice: None
Pros: Lots of benefits and good health care benefits
Flexible hours

Cons: Need to like electronics I think
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay if you like to work

Cons: Horrible work life balance. Never a set schedule and punished for taking PTO by having to make up days missed once you return. Field sales managers feel like retail employees based on leadership directives, which constantly change by the week. None of which helps with our never ending schedule changes mid cadence which ruins our executive presence in-store. no one really gets reimbursed for mileage so in turn, our car's need heavy maintenance for only about $5-$10 back in return a week for gas. I could go on but all in all, I'm still with the company (for now) so until a better opportunity that's financially rewarding with good enough benefits presents itself, I will reluctantly remain an FSM.
Advice: Listen to your field team. In sourcing your employees isn't a "reward" it's a privilege for you and us all. It grants you the peace of mind knowing we will be out there doing SEA proud with integrity, not for you to work us to the bone until we lose pride in what we do. Respect that we have families and want time with our loved ones on major holidays like Thanksgiving. Please stop rubbing that we're all "One Samsung" and in sourced in our face every chance you get. It makes us want to quit and walk away for thinking you did us all a favor. I once loved my job but am now feeling depleted and unappreciated.

Advice: Improvise on the management skill and on-boarding process
Pros: Just a good brand name to work for

Cons: Joined Samsung C&T, Americas at the start. Sounded like a great opportunity. Turned out to be a dead end real soon.
1. Wrong US management for a start-up. Lot of conflicting priorities.
2. Korean Management even worse. They have no understanding of western business practices, no expertise in the   
     construction field and are very arrogant. Did nothing to help foster corporation between Korea and the US.
3. If you are not Korean your career is dead. Funny US managers were let go, Koreans got sent back home (Real 
    Double standard)
4. M.O. seems to be to hire westerners to lay the ground work, then replace with Korean staff.
5. Hired a lot of really good people, than did an amateurish job of laying them off. Worse had no plan for the people 
     still employed. 
6. New GM is in the office part time. Office needs a full time talented leader to turn it around.
7. Korean staff has very little respect for US staff and US staff has little if any respect for Korean staff
Advice: You had/have good people. 95% of problems are management related or caused. Get good leadership from both sides of the Pacific. Keep HQ involvement limited. Your employees deserve better than that have received so far.

Quarterly bonus

Cons: I don't know who is dictating the schedule of the field team, but it's gone from bad to worse. Used to be a Mon-Fri job. It was awesome. Now, who the eff knows. We get sent out a schedule a week before it starts for the month. Working company holidays, 8 DAYS IN A ROW over Thanksgiving...for no other reason than this greedy company trying to push a few more boxes. The team is miserable, doesn't have 2 days off in a row...I could go on. This has gone from a territory management role to a retail micromanaged position. Don't you dare have more than 3 pieces of swag on your table during table days, or try to spend time with your family on weekends. I'm sure after S10 launches, they will see a TON of turnover. All the good ones are leaving and upper management doesn't give a damn. Oh, and you will only be promoted if you came from the best buy side....a failing program.
Advice: Open your eyes & ears, you're destroying what was a great team. Lift the blackouts ( 7 months out of the year) and kill the weekend work... it's NOT working. Have a flex schedule. ASK for REAL feedback from the team. We are NOT retail employees.
Pros: Used to be a great job with a lot flexibility. Those days are toast.

Cons: This is the most unethical, unorganized, and unstable place I have ever worked at. Be prepared to work six days(12 hours)/week. This is great if you are an hourly associate since you will receive overtime pay. However, if you are salary do not expect to receive overtime pay.  Supervisors are paid $12.50/hr on Saturdays.  That's right $12.50/hr on Saturdays. We make less than  hourly associates on Saturdays. Area Leaders make more than supervisors with all the overtime we are working. Some Area Leaders base pay is over $20/hr and $30+ with overtime. Supervisors are well underpaid (salary range $49k-$70k+) when considering the amount of time spent in the plant as well as the workload.  There is a major disconnect between HR and supervisors on the production floor.  We are treated like incompetent children by HR. They do not take the time to establish a professional relationship with us. The communication between HR and management here is extremely poor. There is no chain of command in the way information is delivered.  Quite often the associates will receive pertinent information before the supervisor. This place is also not a safe place to work at.  Safety is not a top concern to upper management. The turnover rate is alarming high. We lost at least 20 salary employees within the month of July alone. I have been working at SEHA for less than six months and I am leaving as soon as I find another job.
Advice: None
Pros: You get a paycheck, 10 days of PTO (for the entire year), No vacation time, health benefits are good

Cons: none none none none none
Advice: None
Pros: it was a great place

Cons: Micromanagement
From Senior Management, Management, Team Lead expect this at all level. 
I don't mean to be Race discrimination here. 90% from this Telecom Division (EMS/OSS( are Indian origin hence expect a Indian working culture. 

No Work/Life environment
when working with this division expect to work 12-16 hours/day, haft of the time work on weekend and in my case as T3 support expect to work/attend Maintenance Window (12AM-5AM) during software upgrade. More over. You are expect report upgrade process at 9AM internal meeting. There are only 4 people in the T3 team and each group is 2 people, hence rotation is every other week. I wish I have known this working hours, hence no-transparent is the norm. Shouldn't there be a working hour law, requirement and disclosure?

Growth and Development.
Learn/train on your own from documents and internal Video session
Documents/MOP are un-organize,. Try to find the people who last updated the document and/or latest document on his PC.
Advice: None
Pros: New 5G technology, employee package.

Cons: Money/Profit obsessed company (but that makes them successful) Lots of politics, meetings, and endless reports & reports of reports. Korean business culture and hierarchy, even in the USA. After hours drinking expected. Demands of managers or their bosses trump any customer request. Expect to drop everything when upper management from Korea visits. If you are not Korean, you will not make much progress. Use this company as a stepping stone.
Management changes every year in December, so there is yearly turmoil and disorganization until the new boss settles in.
Advice: Need more humility.
Pros: Budgets are available if you have an appropriate cause. Excellent benefits, especially health coverage. Good support for travel.

Cons: Probably 85% of employees are outsourced - only upper management are permanent employees.  Samsung also has VERY high turnover - people drop like flies there.  Samsung is a Korean company - but the Koreans micromanage EVERY aspect of business-to the point it's counter-productive.  Everything has to have approval from Koreans prior to coming to fruition - and Koreans will ask a million questions about why you are requesting whatever it is you want.   Way too many hands in the pot.  Also-Koreans don't like anyone who is not Korean or at the very least Asian.  All upper-management is Korean.
Advice: See above.  Stop being so racist towards non-Koreans and pretending like you don't understand English when someone pushes back on you for questioning them.  It's very frustrating.
Pros: The people are the best reason by Far to work for Samsung.

Cons: There is no work life balance, with average working days normally exceeding 10 hours and working during saturdays.  Management does not conduct business in English, so all internal meetings are held in Korean, making it difficult to participate in meetings.  Decisions are never made in meetings, as Koreans are not comfortable having open discussions.  Management changes every year, making it very difficult to carry out short term and medium term goals.
Advice: As a global brand, company needs to incorporate western business practices.
Pros: Company name opens many doors.  Benefits such as insurance are great.  Large number of employees across the various companies allows for lots of networking.

Cons: hardly found as long as you are willing to live and work in Korea.
Advice: Keep moving forward to global culture standard so that the company becomes global company.
Pros: As a sales manager in headquarter located in Korea, I worked with so many various IT companies such as Amazon, Apple, Sony etc. Everyone knows Samsung that has been leading many industries(Mobile, TV, Display, Semiconductor etc). So, that is more than just a privilege. If you want, you have many career opportunities and compensation is overall better than any other competitors. Work & Life balance is getting better. What you've probably heard about it is rumors that applied long time ago. Working culture is getting global as well.

Cons: Usual problems of a large company made worse for people at US site by Korea-centric leadership attitude.   Silo-ed, very complicated corporate structure, hard to communicate, variable quality management - can be quite ineffective.    Many people wonder why the great success when they look around them and see what's done that they can see.   Somehow, enough works somewhere for the company to succeed.
Advice: Better take advantage of remote sites to lead and innovate.   Everything driven from Korea wastes the strengths of other locations.
Pros: Polite, calm culture, a lot of good people, ambitious culture,

Cons: Look at the track record for the last 10 years layoffs, third party, micro managed. Black out from vacation for almost 6 months Thanksgiving - March 22nd and then summer time almost 2 months. Working every Saturday, Sundays mixed in and major holidays. Feeling of results only not there to help field teams succeed but to insure they are doing their jobs.
Advice: Work with field team closer as support not to micro manage. Have a better plan for execution instead of the internalized, third party, layoffs back and on and on.
Pros: Good pay and benefits. First hands on of latest devices. Representing one of the top brands available.

Cons: Abusive atmosphere
No autonomy
Red tape everywhere 
Now matter what level you are, you are just executing
You won’t get far here unless you are Korean
Also they tend to prefer to hire Koreans 
HR does not care if management abuses you and turns the other cheek 
Everyone is stressed and miserable

Benefits
Subpar medical benefits
2 weeks of maternity leave
Medical leave is shady parameters 
Politically- right leaning 
Perks are terrible - it takes months to get the friends and family discounts for the devices and when you do- you get better deals on amazon. 
If you are lucky to get vacation approval from management
Advice: Stop abusing your employees 
For a Tech company you are terribly behind the benefits and perks of your competitors.
Your reputation in the industry is terrible for a reason
Pros: 1. Big name company 
2. Big name company
3. Big name company 
No more  pros that I can think of...

Cons: Location of the office is terrible since there are always lots of traffic, makes me nervous driving there because of all the bad drivers.
Advice: There are a lot of Korean employees so they speak Korean most of the time which is very rude in a business environment for all the non-Korean speakers
Pros: New Samsung building is great with a cool game room, basketball court, volleyball, ping pong, pool, video games, nap pods.  HR are quick and responsive and very helpful.  When CEO come around they have meetings for them to communicate with employees and let them know status and plans for the company.

Cons: The office is extremely quiet like a library
People are generally not friendly 
Long hours- leaving at 7 is normal
Meetings can be all in Korean, and you are expected to sit there
hard to transition to higher positions, no internal job board
Advice: TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES, expecting them to be experts right away is extremely frustrating. 
Give them realistic targets so they don't burn out.
There needs to be more team synergy, having one person hide all the information is extremely frustrating. One person can not manage all the accounts. 
Be honest about career management, there is no marketing department
Pros: Great HR department
Great benefits
Ability to source new products at your own discression

Cons: Expect to be thrown a million things all at once on a salary job and you will have 80 hour weeks sometimes. Basically a south korean company whom disregards labor laws. So your 45k-55k a year job really is half that because you work twice the hours for that pay.  The work life balance despite all the time off doesn't work because then when your back from vacation you have 3x more work to catchup with time lost. Your doing work reports all night and manager calls you after normal business hours asking for information. They entrap their employees as well and i will be seeking legal action for the overtime not paid and abuse of labor laws in Florida.
Advice: Don't micromanage. It never helps the company and helps to get good people fired. Experience is valuable and in this economy quality employees are hard to come by. Focus on helping your team not making them feel spied on, or constantly in fear.
Pros: No doubt they are a huge company with money to throw around. The benefits are great.

Cons: All the strategic direction and decisions come from the Korean headquarters; and unless you are Korean, you are treated like a second-class citizen and your ideas and contributions are not be valued. There is very little transparency and sharing of information within the company. They have no idea how to “collaborate” or “innovate”. Majority of senior executives are from Korea and they are quite rude, disrespectful and raise their voices. HR is unable to shift the culture of the company so that a company that has offices and presence in the US adheres to US values and professionalism in the workplace. Women especially are treated badly as Koreans are quite chauvinistic and expect everyone to bow to them - literally. Despite its new building in San Jose, Samsung is a rotten company!
Advice: You can't run the company as though you are still in Korea. Need to learn and understand the US corporate culture and adapt.
Pros: The gym is fantastic and they have great trainers. They also provide free lunch at the cafeteria and the food is not bad!

Cons: - Work/life balance is virtually non-existent
- Sales goals are extremely high and out of touch with reality which is demoralizing
- Upper management has poor communication with field management 
- Job focus and objectives are constantly changing with little or no reason given which leads to confusion and poor execution 
- Field team is managed from afar with often unclear direction, but still held accountable for things out if their span of control
- Upper management focuses on negative performance management with little recognition given for contributions to the program 
- Limited career development and promotional opportunities
Advice: The turnover rate for the Samsung store in store program is very high and will only increase unless upper management takes a more positive approach, becomes more supportive and begins addressing pain points in the field.
Pros: - Great benefits 
- Schedule flexibility (work from home office) - Get to demo the latest mobile technology

Cons: -It is a Korean company:  poor communication from management; employees are treated poorly, especially if you are not Korean; complete disregard for US business practices; you will often be told that Americans are dumb and lazy; excessively long hours; mangement makes busy work (insane reporting of excrutiating detail); everything is a last minute fire drill and half-baked, there is no planning; manage by instilling fear in employees
-Most of US management is young and never really had any true leadership experience.  So, there is no leadership anywhere, just lots of micromanagement.  The lack of leadership depth produces a rude, disrespectful environment.  But they all look "pretty".
-The systems and tools employees have to do their jobs is unacceptable for a Global company as big as Samsung.
Advice: Implement world-class systems and treat all employees with respect.  Let local employees run the company.
Pros: -Benefits are very good:  cost and coverage is best in class.
-Pay is fair.
-There is no time to be bored
-Great brand recognition
-Produces good technology/product

Cons: Newberry is like little Korea.  Probably 100 Korean team members running around everywhere making important decisions based on each of their own measurements.
Drastic changes to process almost daily.  Most with little or no notice.
Work hours are as bad as I have ever seen. Expect at least 6 working days a week if not 7.  14 to 16 hour days on top of that.
American team not allowed to make any important calls.   Your role is only to take the blame.
Everyone there is looking to leave.  Honestly the worst environment I have ever been a part of.
Advice: The Korean work ethic in Newberry will never work.  Let the Koreans run the place or the American team.  Its not working with two drivers of one car.  Honestly, I am not even sure who runs this place.  Even the Koreans seem to have teams work against each other.  Crazy...
Pros: Health insurance is good and cheap
Product discounts are nice (not great but nice)

Cons: No work-life balance. Koreans are expected to sit around in their desk until their seniors leave work. And they usually work until 8-10pm. When busy, easily passed midnight. High work ethics but no efficiency at work. Expected to be ready to come to work, get on the messenger or answer your phone even in the week-end. Everything's 'emergency'.
Always worked in fear. Higher managers are always extremely stressed under lots of pressure. Managers don't know how to manage people. The whole company needs a serious change in work culture.
Advice: Management must learn to repect and appreciate their employees. Hire more people so employees don't have to overwork for 2-3 people's work load.
Pros: Since I came from abroad to work for a branch in Africa, they paid for my apartment (considering the local rental price, $2,000/month), transportation (had a driver who helped me commute) and free quality lunch. Depending on the sales, good compensation.
Looks good on the resume. And after working in such a high pressure workplace, nothing else seem terribly difficult.

Cons: Hierarchical, which would be fine if leadership were stronger.  Nepotism is rampant with a healthy dose of extremely, unethical and unprofessional behavior from Sr. Leadership on down.   There is a sickness within Samsung, that has been compounded,  from previous Sr. Directors to the newest leadership and offices.
Advice: Do your due diligence, audit the last few years of new offices, teams and divisions.   Work on collaboration, transparency and hire qualified people.  Respect all of your employees and clean up the corruption.   Hopefully then you can  keep talent as opposed to losing it.  Samsung has so much potential, but there needs to be some major cultural and professional changes to right the ship.
Pros: Great Pay, Great Benefits and Products

Cons: Really none. SARC is three years old and continues to experience rapid growth and success. I think the design roadmap is challenging and exciting.
Advice: Keep it going. SARC is a unique environment with a bright future. I've spent over 20 years in the semiconductor industry with various companies and this is as good as it gets in my opinion.
Pros: A great collaborative engineering environment focused on advanced high performance and low power CPU/GPU  design. A perfect blend of senior design engineering talent and junior engineering energy. There is no better place for new grads to be exposed to industry leading designs and work closely with accomplished architects and engineers. There is high morale and a shared sense of accomplishment which is not easy to find.

Cons: No holidays off, the company is constantly changing their focus, they have way too many sales tracking forms and spreadsheets. I felt as though I was a number and not an employee. 

There are too many layers of management, and they poorly coach the employees.
Advice: Minimize the amount of spreadsheets you use to track sales and activities, eliminate the Mosaic middle man HR company (they never know what's going on in the field), stop focusing on any your product is a superior product - no one cares. People buy from companies who appeal to customer's identities, and not so much the features of your products. Also, stop hiring nerds to sell your technology; you need individuals with strong interpersonal skills to move product.
Pros: Pay is okay, once and a while you get technology on rent.

Cons: The foreign work culture is a lot of the time very disrespectful to the American citizen. You are treated like you are less than, if you rank under others. Was told in daily basis that work is more important than home/family life. Paid time off /vacation and sick time are the same. Even with doctor statement you are still punished on point system. Have to give 24 hours notice to use PTO or sick time and avoid punishment points. Very little off time work 6 days every week no matter what. They never promote from within. Very disrespectful to employees. Everyone is overworked and exhausted all the time. High turnover rate.
Advice: Just try to care about your employees a little. Give them a reason to want to stay. Start promoting from within and give your people a chance. Try to lead by example and not rule with fear.
Pros: Great Benefits. Not a physically demanding job. Depending on where you work average pay.

Cons: Under-paid, over-worked, under-valued, no respect, micromanaged, mind numbing work at every level, awful benefits. 100% honesty: do not work here......the workplace culture is truly awful in all aspects.
Advice: Complete restructure
Pros: There really are none at all.

Cons: Horrible work environment with poor management.
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits and compensation is average.

Cons: Unorganized, answers from Korea not from this office.
Advice: None
Pros: Electronic deals for employees and friends

Cons: The problems are just in all other places.

Poor planning, poor communication with HQ, poor work hours and work-life balance. Unclear expectations lead to a lot of rework and inefficiency. Inexperienced management that does not know how to properly plan a project. Massive reporting and micromanagement. Emergencies arise constantly that requires you to stay late for no good reason, e.g. create a demo for a visiting executive who just happens to be passing by to go somewhere else.

To properly gauge work-life balance, check the parking lot after hours or on weekends. Unfortunately, the parking lot here is full of cars after hours and on weekends.

Programmers are given only one monitor. Request for second monitor or more ergonomic workstation is always denied unless you get your doctor to declare you disabled.

This place also takes advantage of foreign workers who cannot easily transition to other jobs. And discriminates against Americans.
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits are the best you can find out there (because you will need it after you are worked hard).

You get to play with new toys before they are released.

Many dedicated and great engineers to work with. Build up your network with great engineers for a while and leave when something better comes along.
 
You will always hear "Money is not a problem at Samsung".

Cons: No room to move up.  All the higher positions are given to Korean expats.
Can't participate in some meetings as they are in Korean.
Long work hours.  More than 8 hours of work each day (around 10 to 12 hours of work) and they expect you to finish everything every day but they will question you if you apply for OT too much and then be blamed if you fall behind.  So you end up working extra hours for free if you want to catch up with work.
Orientation talks about how Samsung Values its people and its corporate responsibility.  But reality is different.  There are managers/executives that shout and yell at employees as if we were in the Middle Ages.  And even if the employees complain to HR, the company does not do anything about it as they would rather keep the executive than the lowly employee.  Thus, good employees just give up and either stay and be miserable,  or resign to preserve their health, or find work with another company.
Advice: Start applying the Samsung Values and truly value your people.
Pros: Good benefits.  
If you're lucky, you'll have a good supervisor or manager who will protect you from all the negativities in the company.

Cons: You are micromanaged the entire time you are there.  The new Brokerage management is very over bearing and likes to do everything themselves, must have 100% control at all times.  There are no SOP's in place, just however they decide to do it and beat you over the head with it.  By this I mean extreme micromanaging to the point they count how many times you have to use the restroom.  Most extreme case of mistrust I have ever encountered in my career.  Asians need only apply this is truly all they want working for them.
Advice: When management fosters an attitude of 100% control what is the point in constantly hiring people, they will all find other jobs because this is not a good environment.    Other companies have went in house with brokerage and failed, what makes you think you are so different?  who ever applies here must be robotic drone that follows all commands or you are targeted for harassment.
Pros: You have a job and get paid twice a month

Cons: Management consistently will threaten your job to "motivate" you. Even though you are a hourly employee they will continue to give you work to do at home. Higher management is direct samsung employees all they focus is on sales and numbers when our actual job tittle doesn't say anything about it. Don't trust Mosaic HR they tell samsung everything, they much rather keep their contract with samsung then protect employees; so you are eventually targeted and just end up getting fired. They will make it impossible for you to request time off and will not pay your for sick days or personal days if you do not tell them every detail as to why you are sick. They pay is good but not worth the headache and stress. My warning to you don't do it.
Advice: Just close it down, samsung is a great company but the employees (Area / district / market managers) from Samsung end is a disaster . Mosaic hired some great people but they won't stand up for their employees so what's the point.
Pros: Good pay, Co workers will feel like a family. But ofcourse that can be due to the same stress and abuse we are all receiving.

Cons: Korean management. You do not get negative feedback. It's not that rare that your emails when you are proactively asking about status of your project or it's drawbacks are simply ignored. Also, many projects have hard deadlines but too vague requirements which result in the lack of acceptance criteria. It is your team's responsibility to come up with something that would amuse management on several levels of hierarchy.

About paycheck. It's better to come to this place with PhD degree or 10+ years of experience. Otherwise your salary's growth would be almost non-existent.
Advice: Take into the account that your company is international. I cannot say anything regarding situation in filials in other countries but in Ukraine all projects were very tightly coupled to the headquarters in South Korea. As a result employees have to adopt to the aforementioned specifics of management which is really frustrating.
Pros: Interesting tasks that can involve cutting-edge computer science (for me it was machine learning). It is possible to transfer between different projects and departments.

Cons: Seems that special shopping discounts on company's website was kept secret between upper management. Lower end personnel seem to have no access. Seems like lots of politics at the top.

Upper management has access to information regarding equipment and always attend training class, but the field personnel doing the actual work doesn't get trained and has to figure out how to troubleshoot issues, until someone decides to do their job and walk us through.
Advice: Training courses offer should be sent to all staff, since the politics with some managers who seem to think of themselves only and neglects to inform their team of upcoming training, even though they themselves attend. It seems that it was done to eliminate downtime and that they would pass down the training to their team. It's difficult to get hold of managers, but easier to get   contact with another team mate.
Pros: Promptly reimbursed expenses without having to wait on client's to pay.
Well Organized company, and all goes well if done within the correct time frame such as travel etc.

Cons: - Can't use your amazing PTO because the company is so short-staffed, there is no one to cover for you
- Work/life balance is non-existent (between the insane amount of work and calls at midnight with HQ, when are you supposed to sleep?)
- Leadership just does whatever HQ (S. Korea) tells them to do, which changes daily
- Impossible to be promoted
Advice: You cannot expect employees to work 60+ hour work weeks every week with little to no burn out. It would be one thing if there was a coherent and consistent strategy, but there is literally no strategy. Everything boils down to "beat Apple" (sorry.. "beat LO"), or... "what is the competition doing? Ok do that but faster and cheaper." 

It's a great company to have on the resume, but get in and get out. Even 10+ year veterans are running for the hills.
Pros: - Amazing pay and quarterly bonus (managers &amp; above)
- Great health insurance
- Good PTO policy
- Great employee discount on products

Cons: The culture is rotten from the root.  From HQ, the very heirarchical culture gives little respect and room of freedom to lower level engineers.  Being a remote office in San Jose, we did not get to experience the worst.  But the local management here is super impowered over those ruled engineers.  Power plays.  Opaque..  Favoritism.  Politics.  Zero trust top down.  It is very difficult to feel proud and willing to contribute when knowing that as an employee you are not really treated as part of the company.  The best way to get company or organizational update is via Internet or grapevine.  Several almost got their pays doubled over several years, while most hardly moved an inch.  A few are very happy, most however are exploited.  The company force installs spyware on employees computers.  employees are not the esset of the company.  There is some fundamental philosophical problems with the company and the local management.
Advice: Think for the employees.  But I know it is impossible for these exploitatiers.
Pros: Health benefit is good.  Good bonus.  Mostly not busy.

Cons: Horrible culture.  Very Korean culture that isn't adjusted in any way for US based employees. It feels like you are occupied by a foreign country.  Work life balance doesn't exist unless you luck out and get a good boss who can shelter you from headquarters culture. And even then they have very limited power to do so.  And US employees including leaders have little to no autonomy to make strategic decisions or push new initiatives. If it didn't come from headquarters, it isn't accepted.
Advice: Look for ways to soften the Korean culture in the US. LG does it pretty well in the US. But LG doesn't seem to have as much arrogance as Samsung when it comes to inflicting their Korean culture on US employees.
Pros: Work for one of the top brands in the world and work with very smart people.

Cons: This company lures foreign recruits to come work at their Korea HQ with competitive salaries.  Unfortunately, they do not tell you that there is a double standard for performance evaluations.   They never communicated this ahead of time. There was no transparency at all.  Foreigners are evaluated at a higher standard because of their higher incomes.  You want to hold foreigners at higher standard because of their higher pay? then give them a higher position that would be aligned with their salary so that they can deliver on higher expectations.  This is discriminatory.  Their bait and switch practice is very questionable and incredibly unfair
Advice: Stop discriminatory practices against foreing hires.  You should get rid of the bell curve that you promised to get rid of two years ago.  Promote a meritocracy based promotion system rather than the seniority based legacy system that still exists today.  You should conduct full 360 evaluations with more than 4 stakeholders evaluating people rather that the current 2 evaluator system which really is a one evaluator system (everybody knows this)
Pros: Tons of company resources, great benefits, amazing infrastructure

Cons: If given the chance, this place will overrun your life
HQ drives huge inefficiencies/unnecessary work, restrictive/slow HQ culture blocks many great ideas from moving forward  
Korean hierarchy above all - what HQ says goes - regardless of impact of those decisions
US leadership is powerless, which also means your department head has very little to do with your job security and/or career advancement

This is a decent enough short-term career opportunity. Get the experience and move on. Most of the people you meet will be gone in two years or less.  

If you have another offer, go there instead.
Advice: For the millionth time, let people do the job you hired them to do. You hire smart people and force them to produce mediocre work.
Pros: Good benefits (Health Insurance, PTO), decent pay
Opportunity to do exciting work and partner with smart and passionate people   
Global brand recognition and large scale projects  
If you have a good manager, good flexibility and team sub-culture

Cons: Too many proprietary systems and processes, I do not feel like my experience here helped contribute to my career prospects in more modern companies. You are constantly working within a Korean mindset, with ridiculous goals often established without any regard to actual market conditions, and can change at the drop of a hat when a new executive decides he wants to try something  different.
Advice: Establish more clear and well-defined company/group/team goals, and stick to them. Stick up for your employees when global HQ starts dragging people through the mud. Adopt industry best practices for marketing, and provide access and training to employees on modern marketing platforms and processes.
Pros: Great coworkers, fantastic benefits (excellent insurance, with most of the premiums covered by the company, 401K match, excellent employee purchase program). You work with some of the coolest products on the market, and work with some of the biggest technology partners and resellers in the US.

Cons: Way too bureaucratic. I spent two days of every week putting together a 30 page report and presentation of what I worked on for the other 3 days. Everyone's time is pretty much spent answering to higher ups. Typical corporate culture. There is no such thing as work life balance. If you don't stay there until 11 pm overnight, you are considered lazy. Oh, and don't even think about leaving before your boss. God forbid he'll notice and immediately scold you for being lazy.
Advice: Your employees will work normal hours, 9-5, then the rest of the time, they aren't working. Trust me. They are just sitting in their seats on Facebook, waiting for you guys to leave because of your incredibly dumb corporate culture. This is what happens if you force people to stay 14 hour days. A human can only do so much work in one day.
Pros: People there are very nice up front. There are a lot of coffee breaks.

Cons: American workers are merely puppets.  The Koreans run the whole show and the dual management structure (One Korean and one American manager) is enough to drive one crazy.  The direction is mainly from the immediate American manager but if a Korean manager says something you are expected to say "how high" when they say "jump."  There is no communication between groups and no accountability.  Promotions are for the most part given to "corp" engineers who are trained straight out of college in the "Samsung Way."  One group now managed by a "corp" engineer has an incredibly high turnover rate and yet he is still manager.  Diversity is getting better but promotions, hiring, etc. are still dominated by those of Korean origin.
Advice: As one of the previous reviews said: get rid of the Americans and fill in with Koreans
Pros: pay is the only reason - I will leave as soon as I'm able

Cons: Verbal harassment on a daily basis in addition to RACIAL discrimination.  Vacation is great, but they don't allow you to take any days off and if you do they give you hell that it becomes a nightmare and that also includes sick days too.  You have to deal with lazy coworkers who don't even know how to do their job (Micky Mouse mentality) so others have to do the job for the lazy ones, in addition to have to deal with managers who don't know how to manage, but all they do is yell, shop for personal stuff online and trash other people during work hours.   AND when you are the one doing your job, you get yelled at, but the people who Micky Mouse all day and are lazy get praised.
Advice: Pay attention to the lazy people who are not doing their job; you also have people who lie on there work hours as well, while others work the 40 hours,  Have Managers take verbal harrasment classes and how to manage employee classes.
Pros: Some friendly coworkers, good health benefits

Cons: Expats are often promised the ability to work for a global company but the environment in Korea is, well, Korean. It requires that the expat adapt a lot to the local culture and environment and though during interviews and sell dinners you are promised faster advancement or the ability to shake things up b/c they need your diverse thought and opinion, the reality is, it's much easier for everyone if people adapt to the status quo, which is what happens.
Advice: Stop selling expat programs as something that really adds value and just be honest that it's to meet internal HR KPIs.
Pros: They offer good pay and cover housing so you can save a lot. Plus, if you are an expat you pay lower taxes. You get privileges that other expats may not - access to certain leaders, events, passes on certain silly things required of locals.

Cons: Lack of communication between departments, which often resulted in misunderstanding and contradictory decisions.

Toxic office politics, one of the worst working environment if ever experienced, I wouldn't have been able to stay for 3 years if I weren't working remotely.

Too many people in the management roles, not enough people who actually do work.

Many people are not capable of performing their jobs, the lack of knowledge plagues the company.

These are the 3 main things that generates unnecessary chaos and stress, and it is not a healthy work environment at all.
Advice: I wouldn't even know what to tell the management because I think it is too big to be fixed, and too big to fail.
Pros: I was lucky to work out in the Playa Vista office for the first year and half and then worked from home mostly for another 1.5 years, this may not be the case for most other employees especially for those who work at the main offices.

Cons: Maybe being more open to working from home, the dress code, etc. This is the Valley and people want to work from home from time to time and also wear shorts, flip-flops on occasions.
Advice: You either accept the management style or you don't. I love the management I interact with and wouldn't change a thing.
Pros: Samsung is number one in many area's and I believe it's number one because of it's commitment to work hard and get the job done at all cost. If you want to be the best, then you have to strive to be the best and here at Samsung I believe we all strive to make that happen.

Cons: - pay is mediocre at best
- very political
- it's like you're working in a different country
- upper managers do not seem to care if you're a non-korean and will converse completely in their language with no regard for politeness or etiquette of any kind
- if you're a non-korean, you practically don't exist; just a fly on the wall
- the highest position in each department is held by a rotational staff from HQ giving you no real opportunity for advancement and oh, that rotational staff has absolutely no knowledge or experience in said field... he (yes, it's always a he) floats in from HQ for approximately 5 years and then floats out, paving the way for your next floater
- trying to get anything done in this place is a joke because there's so much bureaucratic red tape and hoops to jump through: manual approval processes followed by electronic approval processes; the many, many protocols they've put in place in order to prevent embezzling (which has happened in the past) more so hinders than helps the business
- your CEO of the moment (because you get a new one every 1 or 2 years), tries too hard to be likeable that he goes around sexually and racially discriminating everyone for a cheap laugh
- this company does not care about its employees
- i've seen long time interns/temps getting passed up for full-time positions but they continue to work the full-time hours
- i've seen hardworking non-koreans getting passed up for promotions while their korean counterparts get promoted
Advice: - promote within
- promote based on merit, not favoritism
- if you want to reduce expenses, maybe limit your upper managers on their monthly expenses instead of letting them use the company money like their personal piggy bank
Pros: - good health coverage
- everyone in the office is friendly and fun to work with
- good work/life balance
- convenient location
- job security

Cons: Everything! Especially the management and work environment. If your not Korean management your nothing. Employees are subjected to discrimination on a regular basis and the favoritism shown to Korean employees is obvious. No knowledge of how to solve problems in an appropriate manner just pass the buck along. Management never takes responsibility for anything and when problems arise the lower level employees get blamed.
Advice: None
Pros: None!!!!!! Horrible place to work. Depressing and frustrating. Feel bad for some of the decent people who are still stuck there. Completely disassociated with how a business should be run. Management is so out of touch with how to do things and they're lack of knowledge for the departments they run is mind boggling! Like said no pros what so ever!

Cons: People get fired a lot.  Get the impression that if you don’t flatter / impress the right people you are done for. 

It’s a big company and people don’t really know what different parts of the org do, and within an org people don’t know why or how things work. 

Very difficult to get promoted.
Advice: People are scared and trust is low.  Be patient in fixing those problems.
Pros: Quite a lot of control and ability to get things done (until you don’t) 
You can dream up an idea and go do it very frequently. 
Benefits are pretty good.

Cons: The culture promotes politics more than hard work.  Managers control 25% bonus payout, without which salary in not competitive in the market. Too much control by management to spend office hours past 8 PM.  In comparison to the profit Samsung makes, they don't even want to pay dinner for people staying late. At time politics based on which company you have worked earlier destroys the culture and creativity.
Advice: Hire managers who are technical and can relate to the engineers, and not just show off their expensive german cars.
Pros: 401K match by employer, job stability, cash rich company

Cons: Samsung's culture is forced upon American workers through South Korean dispatchers (closed fraternity, with a military management style feel). Samsung always works hard, however, Samsung often doesn't work smart.
Advice: Continue to hire very experienced American workers, but allow them to tell you what you need to know (without retaliation) vs. what you (Korea HQ) wants to hear.
Pros: Once Samsung overtook Nokia for #1 Globally and fully developed their line of Galaxy smart products (Galaxy S; Tab; Note) the new American CMO was allowed to spend serious marketing dollars on multiple media campaigns, in order to compete w/ Apple.

Cons: Little recognition. Forced distribution ratings for annual reviews. Upper management gets rewarded at the expense of the foot soldiers. Perks and benefits continue to decrease as cost cutting measures take effect the past few years. Runs lean. Current employees expected to do more with less.
Advice: Recognize and reward your foot soldiers. Provide clear path for advancement. Listen to and respect the feedback of your employees.
Pros: Innovative company with global resources and reach. Pretty good job security and good benefits. Pay is decent but not stellar. Great daily per diem when traveling.

Cons: HQ is full of elitists and will resort to sabotage in order to pad their egos.  Some of the worst communication I've ever seen, to the point of hostility on both sides.  You have to take a step back and look at the absolute absurdity... I'm surprised this company isn't somehow bankrupt.
Advice: Morale was highest when HQ was doing their own project.  When their project failed, they "accumulated" ours and everything went downhill from there.  Communication would be a start.
Pros: Good pay, decent social life (if not in Korea) and I suppose a decent career for someone with no aspirations.

Cons: Management changed frequently. Priorities constantly changing. Working in facilities, emphasis on cleaning the plant was often put ahead of operating the plant. Promotions were difficult, often non-existent. Self evaluations are a joke. Each department was required to give a percentage of poor reviews, no matter what. Rating on reviews ranged from 1-exceptional, to 5-instant termination. Most employees received a 3-average worker, but someone was required to get a 4-below average. To go from senior tech to master tech was nearly impossible. After submitting an application for master tech, your manager would give you a rating, then the application went to a board of managers and senior managers. They would decide if you were worthy of an interview, although no one on the board may be from your area, and may not even understand your job. Often times people would quit, then come back a year or so later, in a better position, a position that they should have been given while still employed there. Common phrase used in Samsung was, we make logic, we do not use logic.
Advice: The book, "Winning with Accountability" was given out to technicians quite often. We were required to read it, and put the principles to use. Management should use their own advise, be accountable. Quit telling workers they should be accountable, and become accountable themselves. Be willing to listen to the people that work for them, not just give out orders all the time. And promote from within. When outsiders continue to be hired for supervisor positions that have never worked for Samsung, or in the department they become supervisor for, they spend a lot of time trying to learn the area and job, instead of supporting the workers.
Pros: Great pay great PTO. Working compressed work week was nice. Bonus structure was nice, whey we received it.

Cons: - Typical Korean or East Asian company culture such as “top down” rigid structure, and it’s less organic than western companies. 
- Top 20 international EPC contractor, but a non-Korean staff's influence is limited even though he or she is high-level management.
Advice: - Don't make your team spend too much time doing what is useless.
- Learn how to use team effectiveness with being flexible.
Pros: - Financially stable as the mother company of Samsung Group, which is the largest business conglomerate in South Korea.
- Provided a great opportunity to manage a large-scale international project with a budget at least $ 1 billion.

Cons: IT infrastructure is antiquated and not what I expected from an electronics leader.
Advice: Fix IT.  It gets in way of productivity. Keep everything else the same.
Pros: This is an RnD office of the South Korea headquarters.  Projects here are for System LSI part of Samsung Electronics so it's not to be mistaken with the FAB on the other side of town. Pay is competitive with industry.  Hours are reasonable. Culture is very friendly, open and team oriented.  The employees don't play political games here.

Cons: It can be difficult to get promotions at times.

Depending on your job position depends on how much you work. Either too little or too many hours. No in between.
Advice: All SEC locations should be full time with part time workers and full time workers. There is a growing demand for the services that we provide, but no one is there to meet the demand sometimes!
Pros: The hourly pay rate is very decent for an entry level position.

Great work environment working with a highly motivated  team.

Management feels more like mentors and they are always available for help.

Cons: 1. You will not get much work until unless you are in a very good team of your choice. 2.  Switching team is very difficult.
Advice: Company Values are good but if they are followed very well. Always Put people first instead of the rules. Getting work done related to issues of It and all stuff need to be online and should keep minimum person in loop.
Pros: 1. Last resort to work, 2. Job security is good until something blunder happens. 3. Compensation is good. 4. Average Rating Appraisal is good.

Cons: Retail work schedules are always a pain anywhere you go.
Advice: Don't stop listening to the employees that work under you, they will usually have the best understanding of how the company is being ran and the good and the bad that come with that. The best ideas can come from the foot soldiers, out there working with the product and customers every day.
Pros: The management will listen to concerns and try to help you figure out your own solution, encouraging thinking outside the box and taking the lead.

Cons: Systems and processes are outdated, hard to have any type of work/life balance. Communication from management is poor. Leadership made a poor decision to move the mobile headquarters from NYC to TX and lost great talent, causing big headaches to replace. More work for everyone and low morale. Culture values face time in office over productivity.
Advice: None
Pros: Hard working culture, challenging, never boring, some fun events if your boss allows you to participate, great health insurance, HR benefits are competitive (if allowed to use them). People are  good for most part.

Cons: Leadership is conflicted between the North American and Korean executives and the political battles between different divisions in Korea and in North America often make it difficult to get anything done in a timely fashion.
Advice: They need to settle their differences and concentrate on the task at hand rather than fight petty territorial battles to insure their own position within the company.
Pros: It is always a challenge, the people you work with are all good, competitent people who will work with you to get your day to day work done.

Cons: Need to hire more people. Only limitation is the location of the facility but SARC is moving to a new location in July and that should help.
Advice: Don't change a thing!
Pros: Work is very interesting in CPU and GPU development. Very strategic to Samsung's growth to Number 1 position in Semiconductors worldwide. People are technically outstanding as SARC has done an excellent job of recruiting the best and brightest. No ego's policy is adhered to.  Leadership at the Group Manager, Director and VP level is awesome!

Cons: Manager is horrible. very strict and crazy. Always drunk and has no idea what he does. I would like a different manager and I have complained but people have said  no
Advice: Stop getting drunk. Be a man. Stop crying. get a better car etc etc etc etc0 etc etc etc etc
Pros: We get expirience first han on the newest samsung devices which is pretty fun and samsung gives us free things

Cons: Can be a lot of long hours that you are paid salary to work. You can travel a few hours a day and you will not always have working new demo. Some managers micro manage and make the job more difficult than is needed.
Advice: Integrity is what you do when no one is watching.
Pros: Work with amazing people In sales, electronics and big box retail. Be the first to show new changes in cutting edge products. See increases in sales and promotions as a result of your activity..

Cons: The top-down ultra-Korean approach to everything can be stifling and suffocating without a strategy. Being pro-active and finding allies is an absolute must. Unfortunately many non-Korean workers never really figured this out.
Advice: To attract global talent, develop global teams that are outside of the strict Korean hierarchical corporate structure and use them as  a best practice for traditional teams.
Pros: Working at Samsung Electronics HQ provided great stretch opportunities rarely available at other organizations. Responsibilities were vast; sometimes discordant which could be an issue for someone looking for structure.

Cons: A shocking amount of office gossip, politics and treachery.
Tons of box checking, even for a big corporation.
Cultural and practical gaps with leadership in Korea that is never, ever going to be resolved.
No culture of teamwork or mentorship. You're on your own, all the time. Good luck.
No clear vision or communication of expectations.
High turnover of good people due to all of the above.
Advice: Communicate vision, expectations, goals. Communicate anything, really.
Support your employees. It matters. We feel it when you don't.
Without some clarity and sense of purpose people are going to continue to leave.
Pros: Good pay and the chance to work on products that ship around the world

Cons: Samsung Telecom America is the offshore for Samsung Korea and they get treated like that.  The work has to get done.  You will face some unrealistic deadline.  You may face some lack of information sharing situations.
Advice: They need to push back in terms of schedules and information shared.
Pros: They are working on some really cutting edge technologies.  The management is understanding and trying, but the work has to get done.  Generally flexible in terms of daily schedule. You can work from home some days if needed.

Cons: The company while strives for globalization of workforce, it tends to heavily rely on Korean Americans in the office. The works tends to be put a lot more on Korean speaking workforce than others by far. 
The company has recently gone through so much changes including budget cut and workforce downsizing and it has started to strain those remaining and cause stress and exhaustion of working lots of overtime.
Advice: If you want to do something then please follow up to it.
Pros: The company offers pretty nice benefits. Growth is very slow and hard to advance unless you excel above and beyond.

Cons: Executive management change with inadequate communications has resulted in challenges across the org with many lay offs and employees concerned on whats next
HR does not manage strategically, they are just order takers and resulted in chaos
Morale is down with many people now leaving
Advice: CEO and C-Suite needs to better lead and engage teams to drive up morale
They need to value people better vs treat as a commodity if they want to retain
Pros: Great Brand and great products
People are mostly very smart, ambitious, hard working, helpful and typically humble
Environment is fast paced (which I like), and with sales growth during CV-19 lockdown bonus rewards have been good

Cons: Since the Korean management team decided to "take over" an already established highly successful business, they have proceeded to alienate customers and destroy confidence with their management protocol roadblocks, communications barriers, and a lack of understanding in US-style relationship business as a model for success.
Advice: Due to the rotational nature of the management staff, you may want to consider not treating extremely talented non-Korean professionals as disposable, unnecessary, and targets for discriminatory remarks often chalked up to "language translation issues." Review the large number of business areas you have undertaken that have folded/failed within the 2 year mark and ask yourself why...
Pros: Perhaps being able to put the globally-recognized name of Samsung on a resume, even though the words and ideas of "Construction & Trading America" seem to negate that benefit.

Cons: Difficult culture to adapt to and almost impossible to have success within as an employee outside of Korea. I've worked in multiple large corporate environments and never seen anything like this. Demanding and difficult to please.
Advice: The company business culture is understandably top down. Leadership needs to work to develop longer term plans that are clearly delineated to the development teams outside of Korea. Running a team in a satellite office is nearly impossible if you can't obtain applicable directives from leadership.
Pros: Dynamic environment that has big budget projects and a huge footprint with the capabilities to do great work. Deep pockets and an abundance of resources.

Cons: Politics are ridiculous, it's all about who you know not what or how well you perform, every group is structured different even though it's all the same company.
Advice: Being a MFG facility, I understand the need to keep things in order, but then you have too much micro managing now. And don't get me started on the projects you HAVE to do in order to even get looked at getting a raise. People screw things up just to put their so called project in effect, even if it's against logic, just so they can say they did it and it goes in their review.
Pros: Benefits, 401k, some of the people you work with are good to hang out with after work

Cons: Work/life balance varies greatly by department and compensation, and growth opportunities are not equal across departments. High stressed departments are expected to do more with less resources and expertise. High stress departments do not value experienced individuals or a non-stressed work enviorment.
Advice: listen and put more value into the employees that work in departments that are having high turn over.
Pros: Great place to get experience of what you want and don't want out of a job. High turn over enables quick advancement to those that are able to do minimal work and focus on climbing the ladder. Constant state of fire fighting ensures you never get bored.

Cons: The management team only cares about playing the politic game to focus and drive their team. There is also a lot of tension between the HQ and employees working oversees. You will be traveling on plane for 10+ hours to South Korea few times a year depending on your job with last minute notice. Due to the time difference in Asia, there will be many days you can be working late.
Advice: None
Pros: You get to play with the latest gadgets. The benefits and pay are competitive. You get to travel to Asia. There is a lot to learn.

Cons: Micromanaging Every Move, if you complain to HR about management you will be out within 2 month seen several time . Not good for woman, different kind of abuse. No human touch  they want you work as a robot.
Advice: HR know who are the abusive managers get ride of them ..Find out all the women workers company fired, for no reason last 3-4 years because they complain about the boss. change the culture. go back 10 years when it was good.
Pros: good health insurance benefits , big company  ..

Cons: Management will never give you a clear cut answer. They beat around the bush. It's very segregated here. It's either your one of us or you're not. Many people quit because they are operating this like how they would work in Korea. They want you to get everything done, but don't want you to work over time.
Advice: Be more direct like the old Korea. Don't be afraid. Be firm but affirmative. Be strict but fair. Reward the people who work hard, not reward the people who do no good for the company.
Pros: The work is easy. The people are laid back. Managers don't get on your case about much. Anyone can adapt to this place.

Cons: this place is driven by politics, data doesn't drive decisions... it's flat, they outsource everything and don't promote from within. if you're female good lucking moving up here. this company will use you, so if you want to come here it's good to have samsung on your resume, that's about all you will get from here. overall this is the worst company i've ever worked for hands down.
Advice: get with 2009, offer flex hours, opp for advancement... you don't have to be chained to your desk to get work done. allow employees to do their job and make an impact. the politics are absurd and you will attract people because of the company name, but as of now, you'll never retain really good employees for more than a few years... this is springboard employer....
Pros: good benefits, decent cafeteria food

Cons: Very stressful

Work long 20+ hour days, several days a week

The expectation is that you get everything done, it doesn’t matter how it impacts you or how much you’ve already been assigned

No negotiation or give and take, just GET IT DONE

Work-life balance isn’t a thing

Poor people culture
Advice: Hire many many many more people. It is not okay to drive employees into the ground, just because you give them a paycheck. 

Develop a standard for the people culture and actually care about the well being of your employees.
Pros: Great base pay 

Big bonuses 

Learn a ton about project management and working for a large company

Great exposure to senior leadership

They send you new devices with every launch

Cons: The scope of control of this office has been since reduced to the U.S. only except for Power and Healthcare projects.  The Korean leadership distrusts the U.S. leadership hired to manage the office.  This constant distrust and power struggle is tangible & even new employees with less than 2 months tenure are already begining to realize.
Advice: Trust one another.  If you can't trust then fire everyone but don't waste talented professional's time in an effort that could be described as "Analysis Paralysis".
Pros: Initially the management made it sound like this newly formed Regional HQ for the C&T parent from Korea could really be a one in a life time opportunity but it never panned out.  The office's geographical territory was supposed to be all of the Americas (North, Central and Latin America).

Cons: Samsung is lacking; in professional courtesy, work to life balance, Management competence and overall employee morale.  Postivie reinforcement on a job well done is never given.  This is a company that believes it's a waste of time to celebrate the milestones achieved.
Advice: Stand up to Korea, press for more local control of business, end the micro-management from across the ocean.
Pros: The only reason I can think of is the security in a steady (and somewhat decent...) paycheck in tough times.  Base salary is the only compensation you can be confident in.  Shady accounting and a constantly moving target make any incentives based on Management Objective basically unatainable.

Cons: Processes are out of date. Communication and clear expectations between parties is some of the worst I've seen. For one of the biggest tech companies, they use wildly behind the times software (they care more about the bottom line than the user experience is my guess at why they purchase such bad products) Company culture is just, bad. It's dead silent in any sort of capacity where we're supposed to be spur ideas/give feedback.
Advice: Listen more than you talk. Value other's ideas - you'll have a more dynamic and brighter workplace and deliverables.
Pros: Honestly there a few great people who are very smart. But move on quickly.

Cons: - long working hours
- broken process for any of the standard marketing support 
- leadership pressure to drive high sales at all times and you get penalized if results are poor 
- no improvements to existing processes since no support from leadership or other teams are given either due to long working hours or just not interested 
- people either quit or get fired on an annual basis that makes the work even harder to execute
Advice: Provide more resources to help improve many of the broken processes and give less stress to working level for poor sales results.
Pros: - well paid depending on your division/team
- global company brand value

Cons: All business decisions come from mother ship in S. Korea.  Soul-less, no personality, no fun, sterile environment, sterile people, good old boys network, spend tons of time on things that do no really matter and dont move the needle, very executional and tactical vs using your brain and data to make strategic decisions.
Advice: More women in executive positions.  Be more open to change and new thinking.  Think outside the lines.  Be less stuffy.
Pros: household name, good retail/product marketing experience, pay, vacation days

Cons: Very few opportunities to move upward in the retail sales field.  The saying "The winds of change are fast in Samsung" is 100% accurate.  Directives are constantly changing, sometimes disconnect between  upper management and the field teams.   Korean company, so very heavily based on Work hard... Work harder culture.
Advice: Be open to the insights from the field.  We take pride in working for this company, but in certain cases, we do not feel valued.
Pros: Great company as far as brand recognition,  innovation,  the current direction they are heading.  They have the best products in the market, and are continuing to produce high quality products.

Cons: Some managers are really pain in the... Some managers goes that far that they want micromanagement on daily report. It takes sometimes over 1 hour to write the report to the manager... silly
Advice: Change the company culture and let the people idea to flow! Don't be on every employee neck and once you start with an idea, just go with it, make the path as straigh as possible not with back and forth left and right move...
Pros: Team meetings are short and very productive, (no boring endless meetings)
People are friendly, no matter what nationality are they

Cons: HR leadership. The leadership fails in every way possible. Racism exist but even when you go to the top it's still not being recognized that things need to change.
Advice: My advice is take a look at  management and inside the heart of your company's Human Resources. It's interesting that even if you call the hotline or bring notice to the racism nothing will be done.   Those that are put in place to help employees deal with these things make empty promises. I was told that my incident would be looked into by the Employee Relations leader in Frisco Texas and she never checked into it. It was almost like she was avoiding me because she never followed up.  No matter how I tried to bring light to what was going on regarding HR nothing got done.  I was not the only victim there where several of us being overlooked and being denied the opportunities that our white peers were given.   What's interesting is I was warned by the very person that hired me. She ended up leaving the company for the very reason I'm posting this.  She had a master's degree in human resources, SHRM certification, not to mention several years of experience.  They hired someone that didn't have her credentials but had the right skin tone "white".  This most agregious thing was being a person with several degrees, experiences and being passed up by those that didn't have close to my Background or education. At every turn they came up with excuses as to why they would not hire me nor those that look like me. Samsung has a very high turn around rate in HR because of this reason right here.  The most interesting part was I was told that this happens over and over and over again yet nothing has been done. It's very disconcerting to now that in 2020 you're still being discriminated against because of the color of your skin. It's very ugly when you do everything you can to shine a light on it but still it keeps going and being ignored. So the hotline doesn't nor does employee relations doesn't work so what's next? What I experienced was them trying to hurry up and get rid of me. My advice deal with human resources leadership start from the top and work your way down and you will see.
Pros: I don't have any to share

Cons: Ultra toxic environment, be prepared to be overlooked for promotions and growth opportunities if you're not Korean or don't have connections to upper management
Incompetent peers
Advice: This company is on course to become the next Nokia, Blackberry. The culture and predominant values do not support a competitive player within Tech. Inability to attract talent with current culture
Legacy (Korean) employees want things to stay as it is and view smart incoming employees as a threat. This place is a mess
Pros: stepping stone to better opportunities in Tech
fairly good signal on Resume of having worked at large global player

Cons: Leadership is constantly changing sales strategy. Compensation Plans are never concrete. Executive leadership is a rotating door.  Korean leadership from HQ still plays an influential role in sales cycle and often times over promises and puts opportunities at risk. No faith in current leadership. Overall morale of the sales team is low. Constant resignations of sales team to competitors.
Advice: None
Pros: Freedom and flexibility to run your business from home. Premier leading brand in tech.

Cons: No respect for individuals or appreciation for work completed.  Focus is always what has NOT been DONE.  Time spent on projects then only to have them discarded, so time is wasted.  Everything is dictated from HQ, they don't conform to the Silicon Valley ways.  No working from home and there's not trust at all.
Advice: If you're doing  business in the Silicon Valley, then adhere to the conventions and norms that make Silicon Valley special.  Bottom line, you're in the United States, not in Korea.
Pros: Big company and with a brand name.

Cons: If you can work a full eight hours without running out of work before half of the day is gone and having to end up cleaning the shop everyday for the rest of the day then you should be allright
Advice: Pick up production and increase manufacturing so hard working people like me could have a job!
Pros: Good paying job and it keeps you busy

Cons: Company still hasn't adopted wider work flexibility though it leads the IT industry on many other reputation.
Advice: Allow more flexibility for working remote and flexible hours to accommodate different conditions especially the working class with family. Otherwise, it could imply it only wants to hire singles or one of the single-like married.
Pros: The company is super fast in driving innovative products and ideas. It's rewarding to work in partnership with other talented colleagues.

Cons: Work/life balance, find ways to not pay commission, change rules on sales quota at end of performance periods, do not promote from within.
Advice: Salesforce.com is not as important as actually going on meetings..  stop hiring VP level folks who don't understand the mobility business. Promote deserving Sr Managers and Directors.
Pros: Benefits and pay is good... changing technology is exciting with good investment in R&D.  Beyond that, not much which is sad.

Cons: intense working environment, far from Seoul ( even though the company provides company shuttles from Seoul to Suwon for free)
Advice: None
Pros: work: High responsibility, exposure to VPs & C-level, can experience all the value chain around products, open to change the team within Marketing Group

Other benefits: nice facilities (huge gym, sauna, swimming pool, rock climbing, squash..)can use it for less than $30/month. free three meals (with lots of choices), free hospital/ medication in campus

Cons: Well, learning new complex task
Advice: Extremely hand on and eager to  learn anything you throw my way. Super eager to learn challenging and new fields to broaden my career
Pros: I really want to start a career that challenges me and makes me want to learn more on a daily basis

Cons: Horrible lack of leadership, strategic vision, failure to adapt to a changing world. Its a manufacturing company to its core. If you do something that doesn't contribute to manufacturing, then you're viewed as an expense, a liability to be cut and not an asset.
Advice: Nothing that hasn't been shared in hundreds of exit interviews already.
Pros: If you feel you've benefitted from working at Samsung, and that there is a good healthy supportive culture, congratulations - you're one of the good people. And *you* are the source of that goodness. Continue to do what you do and don't let Samsung get you down.

Cons: There is a lot of things to learn every week about their programs and the company. Sometimes these information are not utilized during work due to the lack of customers traffic. People slack off and there is not much room for growth.

Pros: Good pay for a part time sales position. Schedule is updated weekly and flexible but you must be available to work on weekends. A good environment to work in except you have to be on your feet all day.

Cons: The professional level of the senior managers is not high enough. The lack of team building and strickt hierarchy creates an unpeasant conditions.
Advice: To concentrate on the team-building processes and change the strategy of support of the Korean employees, while decrease the informal oppression of the non-Korean employess.
Pros: Nice team, with employee oriented policy, sich approach provided intention to work and operate. Rather competitive salaries, this alos creates a certain advantage.

Cons: Systems set you up for failure.
No true quality programs.
Fast paced, no quality etchic.
Quality training to do your job with-out error.
lack of computers and working space inside the FAB.
Advice: Dr. Deming said "is it the person or the system?"  High quality people with strong work ethics should be allowed to move to another area if the current job is not a good fit - before the employee fails in the current position.  Simply firing people is Samsung's loss.  Not being eligible for rehire if the person was not a good fit in one department is also Samsung's loss.
Pros: Pay
facility
safe working conditions
bonuses
cafe
coffe bar
peers
Nice FAB
Listerine in the bathrooms.
clean
matching lunch money

Cons: Decisions come from Korea and most of the time the US employees it effects are not considered. Very unorganized with how they give you information and resources to be effective at you job.  Expectations at times are very unrealistic and fluff is preferred over quality a lot.
Advice: cultivate your team, provide them with the necessary tools to effectively do job.
Pros: Large company with great benefits.  Flexible schedule due to the fact that you dont work in a office

Cons: Working as a team with different environment and different people is my big challenge

Pros: Um im very good in IT so i hope working here will helps me improve and learn more about electronics.

Cons: Being a white american, I find that this company discriminates against the non-Koreans of the workforce. I was given excess responsibility and was set up for failure from the start and If I knew it was going to be an upward battle from the start I would not have joined here.
Advice: Spread the workload evenly and avoid being racially biased with the work load.
Pros: On one hand there are a lot of great things to learn from working here.

Cons: - decision making is rigidly top-down ; top-management mandate rules the business decisions even though they're not the most optimal ones

Cons: A young software company. No well-established company structure and immature management. Lot's of people coming and leaving. Difficulties in cross-cultural (Korean) understanding. Ultra-conservative approach to management. Difficult to get a raise.
Advice: Listen to your people.

Pros: Hard working employees.  Good exposure to new technologies.  Challenging work.  
STA offers great benefits and the compensation is good.  End of year gifts are nice.

Cons: Korean management is hard to work with. Work is project based and if a department does not manage to "sell" new projects to hq they are being closed (which happened to my security department at Israel)
Advice: Instead of trying to get every center in the world to adjust to the Korean culture try to adjust hq to the western culture
Pros: Many proffesionals to learn from. 
Good salary. 
Comfortable hours (at least in israel)

Cons: Very demanding, hard to get promotion organically, work life balance is bad.  Have to manage carefully the often conflicting priorities, not everyone will be happy.

Pros: Great benefit, 401K match, annual gift, special annual bonus (depends on business results), employee discounts including Kia and Hyundai car shopping. 
Chances to play with many leading edge gadgets

Cons: There is simply too much work. They need to hire more people to handle some tasks, but they don't. Most of the time, I had to work from 7:30 AM to 7 PM, only taking 30 min lunch break. Upper management doesn't really care about the workload you have, as long as they get what they want.
Advice: None
Pros: Samsung's health benefit is great along with other employee benefits such as employee discounts, bonuses, PTO hours ...etc

Cons: You must work very very hard. It depends on your division.
Advice: None
Pros: Samsung group will make sure that you will get good salary as similar as intel or higher than others if you have job experience at Apple, Intel, A.M. and so on. In addition, they are  ready to learn your experience as soon as possible. 
Engineering supports from Samsung is great. Once you requests anything which you need, they will arrange that you get what you want.

Cons: No job security. We were sent a “look ahead” schedule for November and December. Everything was changed last week of October. No consistency. We were taken from third party, 2020 companies/PRS, in 2018. Layoffs in June of 2019. More layoffs and outsourcing back to third party companies in January 2020. We are told to sell but don’t make commission. Constant change in quarterly bonuses. No opportunity to be promoted. Some people are told one thing and others are told another. Leadership was taken from a failing program at Best Buy due to networking and who they knew.
Advice: Treat employees as people.
Pros: Flexibility, (sometimes) new technology, travel

Cons: Salary is slightly above average. But no stock (except if you are VP and above). Can't compete with large tech talent pool that way.
Work-life balance.
Advice: Offer stock to Director and below levels.
Pros: You'll always discover new ways to grow within your role. 
Leaders invest in developing you.
Great products.

No inclusion
Company doesn't reflect its "values" - the "values" are there just for pandering purposes
Upper Management does not care at all about staff
Bullying and harassment in the workplace
managers constantly undermine you
All talk, no action
They will try to "trap" you there. if you know your worth, get out or better yet, don't work there in the first place
Advice: Stop being bigots
Pros: Benefits are OK. PTO is pretty good but you can never use it because as management loves to say, "put in more OT!!"

Cons: Only Koreans are given authority for decisions. Korean run companies are selected for external support operations whenever possible. Racist!...Corporate culture is to serving management rather than customersBut only Koreans are given authority for decisions. Racist...Culture is focussed on serve management  rather than customers
Advice: I would ask that they open up to people, ideas and systems that are in sync with the country (US) in which they operate.
Pros: Solid products, no question. .

Cons: Limited your development on the career.  No exciting challenges.  You don't have to take so much pressure so that you will be sluggish.

Pros: The culture of this company is very good.  People are very nice to each other.  And the workload is fine.  Co-operation with other people.

Cons: Oversight from Korea feels like you report into two leadership teams at times. Unstainable appetite for reporting and data that detracts from ability to manage day to day business tasks. No stock options. Career advancements only occur during one period annually.
Advice: Continue to modernize the employee perk and the work life balance to attract and retain top talent.
Pros: Great pay and benefits. Work life balance is improving. Stepping out of the early 2000's and making efforts to modernize employee perks similar to other large tech player (i.e Peloton reimbursement).

Cons: Koreans are very distant to non-Koreans. Korean management while being very capable in Korean style business  practices are out of their element internationally. 

2 tiers of employees, Korean and everyone else. No room for advancement. Koreans see non- Koreans as lazy, Non-Koreans see Koreans as needing to re-event the wheel everyday (Ground Hogs Day, everyday)

Life gives you lessons and opportunities, Samsung was a definite lesson.

New CEO bragged he worked for Jack Welch was going to make things happened. For that to happen he would have had to change the whole company culture….Never going to happen.
Advice: To late, Office closed down
Pros: Great benefits, worked wGreat benefits, worked with some really good people a lot of potentialith some really good people a lot of potential

Advice: no feedback at this time. overall a well managed company with strong leadership who cares about employees.
Pros: well managed foreign company with strong leaders, beautiful 10-floor new building in San Jose, free lunch for all employees with multiple choices of food every day. onsite fitting room with great window view. good teams with many capable engineers.

Cons: We were promised new devices every 6 months, that was never delivered. We were promised promotional opportunities but there was no real way to track progress in store due to no supervisors being in store at all times. We were left unable to answer questions about new products due to them not releasing them to us until they were released to the public.
Advice: None
Pros: You get to be trained with some of the best devices and see them first hand. Interact with all types of customers.

Cons: Little upward mobility and opportunities to grow into and/or learn about other facets/departments of the company. Senior leadership could do a better job of recognizing good work, especially concerning lauding newer, younger, but exceptional, talent over tenured employees who have performed at meets expectations over time.
Advice: Address the above issue - this would also improve employee moral and engagement.
Pros: Prestige of working for a well-respected company and the opportunity to gain professional business contacts and industry knowledge.

Cons: High stress environment 
Unrealistic expectations/deadlines
Workload tends to be unmanageable in a typical 9-5 work day 
Long hours are often required

Healthy vacation and sick day allowance 
Generous paid holiday time off
Bereavement policy
Hour paid lunch

Cons: No hiring excellence criteria
Lack of trust on the human resource
Manufacturing Plant management style
Zero Marketing Capabilities, the marketing plan consist on reducing the price.
Overall disrespect from Koreans to locals.
Advice: Wake up is the 21st century, high employee rotation will eventually hurt the growth. Be a real global organization. The talent market knows how tough is to work at Samsung, it is hard to find real talent willing to put up with the management culture and style.
Pros: Amazing Product Development team
World Class Supply Chain organization
Massive Internal Information systems

Cons: Horrible upper management, always mirco managing, your working although your off the clock or home: meaning if your coworker sends you a email you must confirm it right away. You'll end up doing more than your job title.As a samsung rep you cant sell the actual product but only bug a best buy team member to sell it to the customer. Job actually deserves 1star im being generous with 2 becuase of the coworkers.
Advice: Just shut the store down.
Pros: Great people to work with, good pay.

Cons: Company politics, I am happier now at a small company. There is a sense that if you are not Korean, that you will not break into the fold.
Advice: Having time to be creative like the 10% time at Google could lead to a happier and more productive workforce. There could be more of a focus on the environment, like other companies that take climate change seriously.
Pros: Interesting work with top notch company. Projects that I work on were things that family could understand. Organized work environment and professional peers.

Cons: They pay is very low.  They pay the same salary nationally, and living in an expensive metro area it is really hard to budget.
Advice: I would considering offering cost of living raises and other forms to make better compensation.
Pros: Lots of Flexibility with scheduling and hours.  The pay is not great, and you are just based on your reports, but all in all it's a good company to work for.

Cons: lack of work-life balance, asian culture, poor recognition of hard work, pay is not as good as it could be for middle and lower level positions
Advice: listen to employee feedback, more competitive pay and to recognize hard work
Pros: great company, looks great on the resume, good industry growth especially during a recession

Cons: All men's club. Very sexist environment where women don't have much say. Everyone is fearing the hierarchy and don't dare speaking.
Advice: Diversify your teams and bring more international management than Korean management, very traditional in how they handle the job.
Pros: Great environment, corporate responsibilities and very committed people. The building and canteen are awesome. We have a lot of resources to work with, from the team access to beautiful facility.

Cons: The worst company culture I've ever experienced, seen or heard of. You will be worked to the bone. No balance at all. Ever. And forget about any onboarding, development, tools or resources. You will be provided with nothing and expected to navigate the most outrageous hurdles at the same time. 

Additionally be prepared for toxic people in the masses. Not just one or two.... most. Including leaders and HR. Everyone had been conditioned to back stab, manipulate and tear each other down. And you can't trust HR or ER to do anything about it. There has been sexual harrasment, code of conduct violations and serious discrimination especially against women. HR knows about it and brushes it off. And In some cases they even participate in it. No urgency. No concern. No action. 

Micromanagement is constant from all levels. You will be handcuffed and expected to run around like a chicken with your head cut off on the least impactful and most meaningless work. Dont expect to enjoy any PTO either. You are always on. Unless you are a low performing dirt bag. Then you will be protected and allowed to make everyone miserable with your terrible attitude all while everyone that is decent and hardworking is expected to do your work.

Everyone will try to place blame on Korea but the reality is you just have a cesspool of nasty, inept and terrible people at one place with no accountability.
Advice: You need an overhaul of your HR, ER and legal department. They are TERRIBLE. They are inept. Most don't even have real HR/ER backgrounds or experience and legal is too busy covering for the misfits and the "risk" they might present to care about the high performing individuals. 

You can't be employee centric when the only employees you care about are low performers and despicable characters. 

Get it together Samsung.
Pros: Benefits and pay are highly competitive, (but they have to be based on what is in store for you as an employee.)
Well known brand for consumers. (Too bad it doesn't translate to employees or partners)

Cons: I did not have to overwork, But I have heard that, after I left, the work was simply unbearabele and my friends left the company beause they could not take the workload
Advice: Please hire better people at the leadership role
Pros: Food, transport and facilities are free and great ! Pay is awesome. You easily go to Onsite

Cons: About 90% of the people I worked with here was stressed out at work.  Everyone has a work load that is more than one can handle in a day's work.  It felt like they were setting you up to fail, so that they can terminate your employment
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits were good.  Apart from this, the only good thing that I can look back to were the people I worked with there.

Cons: Device manafacture. Pressure to release new features every year requested by whole salers and retail channels
Advice: As software gets more matters and online updates are available to provide additional features and updates, need to change the releasing schedule and less depend on the retailers in order for more advanced product to release.
Pros: The most skillful engineeres and designers to build the world best quality electronic devices from TV to Smart Phones.

Cons: tyrannical management, very long hours, disdain towards non-Koreans, high pressure environment, constantly on call, thinking out of the box is frowned upon, pretending to love everything about the company is strongly encouraged
Advice: Just leave the U.S.  

Americans would be better off working for and buying from American-owned companies that value their workers and encourage cooperation within the work environment, as well as a life outside of work.
Pros: pay and benefits are the only good items, but given that the required hours are 55+, the pay doesn't really pan out as a benefit

Cons: The team is relatively small compare to the Samsung's research arm in Korea. But the group has been growing very fast in recent years.

Cons: This review considate a few common feedback by peers who left. The department is toxic due to the head (G****l). 
Scolding, gaslighting is a norm.
Top management tried to prohibit such behavior, but ended up only moving occurrence from public to slightly secluded area.

Poor career path as higher position normally held by korean. 

The subsidiary culture is inclined to pleasing management to HQ. New project launch each year just for the sake of reporting and KPI. management will highly focus on the project when it is 'seen' by HQ. Previous in progress projects will be neglected, and the person who handles the project will suffer. 

As I didn't work in another department, these comments are only applicable to innovation teams in SME .But the turnover is high as a whole subsidiary.
Advice: Look into high turnover department, give proper training for the head, or assign someone who are actually capable.

Creates stress and anxiety 
Some run around the office like their lives depend on it - amusing but ridiculous!

- Micromanagement is a standard. You should do what you are told to do, but when that does not work - it’s your fault.
- All the rumors about local Samsung are true.
- Aside from bonuses, you get no benefits. You have to pay participation for health insurance, and there is nothing else. 
- I’m not sure if anyone used their vacations days (bare minimum of 20), you should be grateful you are using any at all.
Advice: Advice is for HR to do their job. It is unbelievable how the bounce rate in some teams is super high and no one is doing anything.

Advice: Teleperformance is a good company to start. but please take care of health of the employees. 
Pros: easy and helpful environment. trainer was very supportive

Cons: One of the most toxic cultures I worked in. Colleagues and managers were emotionally burnt out, which was very draining. Bad and toxic behaviours are tolerated, especially from high management. I have seen countless people having to take sick leave from being over-worked.
The main issue is cultural, which comes from the Head Quarters in Korea. Their priority is NOT people or employees, even if they state it in their company values. All they care is about financial results, and squeezing every inch of blood and energy someone has to give. Additionally, there's no diversity at all. 90% of senior leaders are male, either Korean or white. This doesn't improve much in mid-management.
Don't be fooled by the name or by a high paycheck, and avoid yourself hours of therapy, anxiety and bad health. Stay away from Samsung.

Cons: **Review: Avoid This Company**

Working at this company has been a frustrating and stressful experience. The direction changes every week, leading to confusion and a lack of clear goals. The high-pressure environment makes it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Moreover, the Korean boss is extremely bossy and often micromanages tasks, which adds to the already tense atmosphere. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a stable and supportive work environment.
Advice: None
Pros: Salary is relatively high compared to other companies. Welfare and insurance is good

Cons: This is a terrible company to work for. They have recently resumed hiring and I feel compelled to warn people. If you intend on applying for a role in the 80 Strand London/Chertsey office please be warned that this is a toxic work environment. Do not be fooled by the pay package. Be prepared to be berated, yelled at and receive nasty emails from management. This is not restricted to just one team but is across the entire operations. The Koreans are treated like Gods and there is no room to share ideas or be innovative. Lots of gaslighting from upper management, they'll constantly keep picking on people till it breaks them down. Managers do not shy away from yelling at a team member in front of an entire team, we have also had managers concocting bad performance reviews to bully people into not speaking up. To sum up, you're giving your soul and dignity for the high pay package. They treat their staff like slaves, and you'll have to endure emotional abuse and bullying.
Advice: Stop hiding in your glassdoor cubicle. Have 121s with the people in your wider department to understand what is going on. Stop burying your head in the sand. Treat your staff with dignity.
Pros: High pay package, but you will end up overworked.

Cons: 10-11 working hours //one have many work load and other doing marking only attendance and sit idle whole and waiting for go home.

Cons: - Korean culture permeates, and it's not a good one. Lots of hierarchy and sadly, even if the Koreans have no idea of what they're doing, they rather continue down the wrong path than to admit that they're in the wrong and lose face so things are usually slow and painful.
- Very rarely does one get positive feedback. It's like being in a hamster wheel, they keep asking for more and more (even if the expectations are completely ridiculous) without any concrete guidance, honestly, I've never been in a job with such little guidance but such massive negative feedback, the word is failure. 
- Don't bother in trying to go above and beyond because when it comes to providing you a score for your PEs or PBPs, you'll always get a "meets most". I've actually been asked to write impossible results that would match up to higher scores on your evaluations so it's essentially impossible to exceed around here. If you do exceed and is proven, higher management will still lower your scores without giving you any explanation except for the fact that "not everyone can get high scores, only some".
- When they tell you to do something, they're not asking, they're ordering you to do so. I feel like I'm back in school where my every move is meticulously tracker - where I am, what I'm doing, when am I going to be in the office. 
- Terrible flexible working policies. I was asked to get a therapist to evaluate me in order to get them to understand that I needed more flexible working. I had to disclose extremely private matters about my personal life in order to justify that. I ended up feeling naked and vulnerable. Even after that, they're still asking me to come in above and beyond what my max days in the office are and they completely forgot that I have an exception because of my mental health. If you don't come in, they ask you to compensate by coming in another day but when you've been more days in that your usual days, you're not allowed to ask them for the same.
- Zero work-life balance. Honestly, I get emails from managers on Sundays, it's borderline ridiculous.
- No competent people across some divisions, some people lack the right experience to understand about specific industries but they're still leading teams across those divisions with no idea of what they're doing and relying on their team to fix things for them and avoid looking bad to the Koreans.
- They make you come into the office (and track it) but you spend most of your time on your own, talking to no one. That's their idea of collaboration.
- I constantly feel scared for my job and very anxious and there really is no one to talk to, you talk to other people in the team and they're all feeling the same way. Super demoralising.
- Tech is one of the worst ones I've seen. It is an electronics manufacturer, yes, but their IT systems are a total nightmare. Because they don't trust their employees, they put a ton of firewall and security systems on the laptops that make them 100 times more slower, you can't access some websites that are required for your job on certain networks, so you have to disconnect, hotspot from your phone to open the website and back to the network. They even started putting security stickers on laptops to make sure that you haven't tampered with the hardware. Oh, and that work phone they give you doesn't allow you to do much except for reading emails and sending messages. You also cannot access your email from anywhere except for a Samsung computer or your work phone and don't get me started on your diary - there is no way to see your diary if you don't have your computer with you so you have to memorise it.
Advice: Stop trying to micromanage, stop trying to pretend like you know it all and listen to your colleagues. We're all adults, we don't need to let you know what we're doing every five minutes or when we're in the office. If the job is getting done, great. Not everything is money so no matter how much more money you want to pay your employees, if the culture is bad, they'll want to eventually leave. My mental health has severely deteriorated since I joined Samsung so I will leave as soon as I manage to find another job that I'm happy with.
Pros: The compensation package is great - high salary, good additional benefits, employee discounts, etc., good pay reviews too.

Pros: Good remuneration package
Well-built systems

Cons: ...however their values get trashed by the culture which is about running around like a headless chicken, spinning wheels, doing things that don't really add any value just to look busy. Expertise is frowned upon in favour of just spinning wheels and wasting time on pointless leadership team appeasement. Empowerment non-existent in favour of box-ticking for leadership. Very little learning and development at all after the probation period. The epitome of that definition of madness where they just want to do the same thing over and again expecting a different result...but they never get it. Understanding of data and statistics is almost non-existent, with the rule being that it's only used to prove the opinion of the person using it, never to open up learning to inform action. Leadership team is an assortment of people from failed enterprises, not successful and market-beating ones. No internal job move opportunities unless you've been on the grad scheme, then it's a case of rolling out the red carpet. Made a big song and dance about having work-life balance but then those without kids or a significant interest in life outside the 8-6 set the tone for what's expected and aggressively hound those whose work isn't their life. Any expertise you offer will at best be slyly appropriated by the audience and no credit will be given to the source at all - this is the worst organisation I've ever been in for this sort of thing; at worst you'll be openly told off for daring to have an original thought.

Cons: - Mentally prepare to see your hard work be destroyed by utterly incompetent local management, over and over again. - HQ leadership / mindset are very good, but often out of touch with what really goes on in this department. - Forget about career progression here, local management goal is to do as less as possible while getting away with it. If you oppose this mindset you will be targeted and gaslighted, they'll go far and wide to protect their little circle. - For these reasons this was by far the most toxic and depressing place I've personally ever worked, with reasonably crazy high turn-overs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You have been warned. That been said, my advice to you is: give it a shot and see how it goes, but always keep an opened mind and be ready to jump off.
Advice: Stop playing games or leave the chair to someone that knows what he's doing and he's willing to commit for the project and his team. Stop antagonizing HQ and talking behind their back, dumping on them the responsibility of your own failures. Stop the lies, manipulations and gatekeeping. Such behavior is not doing you any good, it promotes toxicity and ultimately will lead to your own downfall. Best of luck and farewell

Advice: If there is a system to grade employees, but then you limit the amount of people that can be graded well (cause it implies promotion that is for only a few people), then it is not fair.

Don’t force people to work from the office if they perform better working from somewhere else.

Cons: Samsung is the "big dog" in Korea, everyone wants to work there. It is a matter of honor to work there. So they work like slaves. They sleep at work under their desks as they are putting in 16 to 18 hr days regularly. If they get fired they won't easily get hired elsewhere. So they work incredibly hard and expect the same from everyone else. In Aus we have other options. What they do is not necessary. So they consider us lazy. I told them they are slaves. They hated me. They are 100% data-driven. It's not OK to hit 95% or even 105% you have to hit your target 100% every time. You get reviewed weekly, not monthly. If you can handle the stress it's fine. If not you won't last. If you can last though then other people know how tough Samsung is and you can get jobs easily elsewhere. They know you can handle.

- No spot increases

No rewards or anything even if you are one of the top contributor on the team, all you get is more work. This company is the perfect example for famous saying: "The reward for good work, is more work" The Korean counterparts always assigns deadlines even if they still have no clue what they want!

Forces you to submit a full fledge excel tracker within 30 minutes, mind you it was requested that moment and it’s a brand new tracker to plot. Telling you there’s no such thing as try your best, u must do it there and then.  All she needs to hear is “Yes boss. Ok boss. Will do it boss”. 

If you intend to apply for a role here, take my advice and don’t even bother. Your mental health is worth more than the salary here.

Cons: My first day at Samsung- At the lift lobby, There was total chaos. People were pushing each other to reach at Entry door for card punching. I was shocked to learn that timing is 8:30- 5:30 (HR didnt bother to tell me this befoe joining). A minute delay mean one day loss of salary.

My first day on floor- Floor has a look of Korean concentration camp where all Indians were sitting at one side and their Korean boss were sitting another side at big cubicle. Shocked to overheard Young Korean yelling at his old Indian subordinate in his fifties"You are fired". Got to know from one of my colleague that Korean bosses yelling at Indian is not new in Samsung.
Indian management do not listen to Indians, they wait for their Korean boss to respond. Even HR will disconnect your call abruptly and do not respond to your emails if you try to raise any question. They are puppets in hands of Koreans. 
Right from the time of onboarding experience till the time of exit, you will have worst experience in Samsung.

Cons: Our position was supposedly not including doing sales but provide technical support to authorised dealers, as Android is never an Apple. But you have push us to be more like a sales person instead of technical product consultant in all your stores, which is wrong. And you have been reduced most of our incentives with the excuse of not hitting targets related to the sales oriented jobscope, which is also unethical. Your townhall meeting or online discussion has put our suggestion to deaf & silence our counter-questions against your ridiculous marketing strategies (as you push them as if you are the Apple). Hope you wake up from your unrealistic fantasy, be a market friendly Android. No more Exynos product but sell at ridiculous premium price.
Advice: Treat your staff equally regardless on field or in office, and left your elegant corporate culture to yourself, the field staff want to have realistic support, but not your threatened tone or hard line instruction to present you a fake marketing scenarios in fake numbers (while you being superseded by others long ago while denying our foresight).
Pros: If you love Android ecosystem that trying to rival Apple, but non-Chinese brands, go for it.

Cons: Truly the most poorly organized and obfuscated management system I've come across. There are so many internal and external Samsung subsidiaries that all compete with and take advantage of each other and you'll likely have to work for or with several of them but good luck getting anyone to explain which ones are which or how any of it works. If you're hoping for one of the biggest technology companies in the world spanning dozens of countries and offices to be working with some of the most cutting edge technology you'll be sorely disappointed. The infrastructure is antiquated and desperately in need of re-vamp. Add in an extremely overzealous security culture that somehow ignores major security flaws in the older technology they're using and you're going to have a bad time getting anything done. There's a corporate HR culture that barely treats employees as human beings, let alone functional adults. The entire company has an out of control middle-management class - somehow manages to have too many micromanagers and no actual people and job management. Expect to have every task questioned, but don't expect to have any meaningful engagement about career development or any issues you have with your job, team or coworkers. You can also look forward to a "hybrid" work from home model - with a mandatory 2-3 days in the office. Not that this is coordinated in anyway so enjoy being forced to commute to the office only to sit in zoom meetings all day.
Advice: I genuinely don't think it's possible for management to improve - this place is a bloated monstrosity of late stage capitalism. If you're a young fresh graduate you should work here for a couple years to get a big name line on your resume but get out and do something better as soon as you can.

Cons: I resigned after 6 months and I was happy to leave. 

There was no onboarding program. There was no clarity on management expectations and what my role will look like. Things were constantly changing and there was no time for any proper communication. I didn't have a manager to report to for first 3 months, then a manager was hired who left after 3 months - he had no background in Instructional Design or Training. There was very high workload and work-life balance was not good. 

I requested for training and it was rejected even though the training was for a new type of ID work that was not discussed at the interview or documented in the job description. Lots of surprises, not very pleasant. 

As an ID, there was very little action taken based on best practices and data driven decision making. Decisions were made based on whatever the manager representing 'client' Samsung wanted. There was lots of micro aggression, no documented best practices and a top down approach focused on 'the client' manager instead of evidence based approach that shows what works and what doesn't work. 

If you are a fast paced worker who keeps quiet and does work exactly as the 'client' wants, then you're ok but if you ask questions or suggest other approaches, you may be subject to excessive criticism, passive aggressive behavior, blame game and abandonment.
Advice: Don't issue 'final warning' letters to staff members who have been in the job for less than 6 months and when you have no on-boarding program and no clear communications in place. Instead, communicate with them to have clarity. 

Don't create a mad rush on deliverables with unreasonable work load. Have documented expected behaviors and timelines on each task in place and use data driven decision making instead of relying on one manager's opinion on what works and what doesn't work.

Advice: None
Pros: International exposure working with colleagues across the world.

Cons: Initiatives and executives come and go at the blink of an eye. Poorly-defined roles & responsibilities for most employees -- this ambiguity causes a lot of project overlap among groups and you often find 2 groups working on the same project simultaneously, unbeknownst to each other. Excessive politicking. Little collaboration between groups. Still a very strong Korean hierarchy and junior level employees don't take personal initiative or accept accountability. Important meetings are held in Korean language and as a foreigner you get left out -- unless you have somehow mastered the language on your own time as Samsung does not provide Korean classes for its foreign employees (you do receive a budget for education but no clear way to use this effectively while working a full-time job). No flexibility at all to work outside the office, and your hours are tracked; i.e. you must sit at your desk for 9 hours/day even if you have nothing to do!
Advice: Where to start???  Two tips for managing foreign employees at Korea HQ... (1) Clearly define roles for foreign employees before they start work, and clearly define objectives which they will be measured against.  (2) Either establish a policy to communicate in English when foreign employees are present, or provide intensive Korean-language education on campus during work hours so foreign employees can contribute productively and not be left out of important discussions.
Pros: Global reach. Mega brand which can get you a meeting with almost anyone. Chance to see/develop some cutting-edge new technologies if you are so lucky. As a foreigner at Korea HQ, you may be thrust into a role which gives you a chance to see the world through business trips. 3 free meals a day at the cafeteria and free shuttle bus transportation to/from work.

Advice: None

Business trips

Cons: Work life balance is challenging, however if work is enjoyable and fulfilling the balance is not so important.
Too much focus on technical skills rather than leadership, managing change and communication. This leads to frustration and lack of understanding by employees of their roles and responbibilities and how what they do impacts the organisation. 
Too much top-down Korean management style, unfortunately this also applies to many local managers who use this as an excuse not to give feedback or support.
Lack of awareness of skill gaps, managers don't get feedback on leadership capability only revenue i.e. as long as they sell/market/manage products well they will be seen as high performers irrespective of how they treat the people around them. They generally get promoted.
Advice: Encourage collaboration between locals and Koreans, listen to both sides and act rather than pay lip service to Samsung being truly global.
Locals do not see Samsung as a fair company and are often not fully engaged, locals see much inequality between themselves and Koreans in compensation and perks. 
Improve communication across the board, stop announcing changes based on one person's opinion rather than the clear facts.
Move into the 21st Century with regards to people management and systems, the internal experience is nowhere near the external perception of the brand.
Pros: Local employees incredibly helpful especially within same team.
There are pockets of good collaboration between locals and Koreans and things have improved over the last 5 years.
Excellent technical skills, Koreans have great capability in managing businesses.
Products are getting better each year.
Opportunity to learn about working in a fast moving corporation.
Working for a well known company gives you a sense of satisfaction when you read how successful it is.

Cons: Long hours depends devision you are in
Advice: None
Pros: good pay and benefits
flexible hours

Cons: Bureaucracy is near government-level. HR too deeply involved in gauging engineering talents and reviews, so much so that smart, creative, but non-conforming engineers are not treated well. HR knows jack about what engineering does yet they are given power to evaluate? Engineering managers don't have any real power in terms of controlling manpower because of the HR intervention. Performance review is corrupt to the point it is virtually irrelevant. Every year a set percentage of employees are given highest/lowest grade in evaluations, but engineering managers work around it by having their team members take turns taking the lowest grade, completely regardless of their performance. Lots of freeloaders who're there just to pretend to be working and kill time. Too much emphasis on "prettifying" documentations. Why must you use PPT in everything? Encouraging employees to quit smoking was great idea; forcing them to take blood tests for nicotine and checking CCTV / building entry logs to identify smokers and penalize them in performance reviews, not so great and might be illegal in first world countries.
Advice: Keep up the good work! You're still the no. 1 place to work for in Korea!
Pros: Samsung Electronics is a truly a gigantic corporate empire. You get to dog food almost all aspects of your economic life. Company is doing great and spirit is high. Benefits are okay. Great newly built buildings, gym, cafeteria, etc.. Competitive pay in local standards. Well-received by general public. (Company takes up 20~25% of S.Korean stock market in terms of market cap., and also 20~30% of total Korean exports) Senior management is composed of some of the best people in the business who are great at bringing in new bread winning deals and setting the right course for the company.

Pros: nice salaries, good transportation to go

Cons: Stressful working environment, unrealistic targets set by management, unhealthy competition between employees. Too many changes - of hierarchy, of internal procedures, high employee fluctuation, difficult to keep up. Work overload, working overtime is expected from everybody. Bad work/life balance. There is a lot of guessing without exact instructions from management due to their lack of experience and know-how. Salaries are not fair and equal for people in same/similar positions. No predefined career path for employees, slow promotion system. Too many young employees without experience. Open space offices - no privacy, difficult when it comes to confidential business issues. Too many unneccessary, unproductive meetings. Too much reporting - often a waste of time. Too many internal programs in which employees work, often it is confusing. In theory a good idea for internal control and organisation, but difficult to handle in every-day practical work. Approvals by 3-8 people should be obtained for every single thing.
Advice: Do not hire people without right experience and then place them on important positions.  When hiring a person for an open position, first consider promoting existing employees, rather than hiring a stranger and not giving existing employees the chance to grow.
Pros: Employees are proud to work in Samsung as it is one of top 10 global brands. We get regular salary, and diverse benefits on top. Working environment is dynamic - it is never boring. International colleagues; possibility to travel to other Samsung subsidiaries for training. Possibility to learn a lot about everything. Existing awarding system for employees. Most employees are visionaries, with strong will and dedication to their work and to the success of the company. Many people from outside envy those who work in Samsung and dream of getting a job there.

Cons: I read in previous reviews that the atmosphere at Samsung Staines is very toxic. Some have said that they had bad experience working with people of Indian origins. 

I don't generalize, but my experience working in a team where the majority were of Indian origin was not good. I felt there is a lot favoritism and pressure. Hindi is the main language (we're living in England). They use their mother tongue as a language of exchange, so that you don't understand. You feel you're there, but outside what is happening. A complete dilemma.

The team lead is very rude and offensive. I had to report him to the HR, but I did not do. I don't like to report. I joined the company to work and promote the business.

Finally, a European R&amp;D should receive people with a research background. People who have validated their degree in Europe or got an equivalent of the degree they hold.
Advice: Some people at the HR are also not honest. I advise the HQ or the the higher management in Staines to take a look on what is happening inside the teams. I advise the higher management also to check if the HR are not selective, discriminatory. A person there (I don't mention their name) has made my arrival very hard, leaving me without badge for 4 days. I could not access the business and I had to borrow other people's badge or wave someone to let me in.

Cons: Bad Work &amp; Life Balance, Lack of organized training process for newcomers, Old-age ethics.
Advice: None
Pros: A lot of things to learn, competitive salary, good for training and challenging itself

Cons: Extremely poor HR policies. One example is that when college freshers join, their teams are decided by HR as compared to the people working in the teams themselves

There is a retention bonus policy, wherein one has to work for atleast 3 years to get the assured package, otherwise have to return the retention bonus part of the salary, which is almost 30% of the total annual compensation .

Extremely tight security. Cant take laptops out of office. Cant bring anything like usb, ipod, etc inside. Hence, can't work from home.

No wifi in office. Even the ethernet speed is very poor(~10 Mbps)

Lot of disparity in compensation and general behavior between IITians and non-ITians.

Work life balance in most of the teams is poor. 

HQ in Korea makes all the decisions. No ownership of any project, except some really bad projects who don't have any commercial value.

Some teams are called to work in weekends, while other teams hardly work half the time they are in office.

No recreation in office, other than a Foosball table and two tt tables for ~5k employees .
Advice: Please listen to feedback from employees and fix the HR policies. If some things are changed, the company has the potential to rival likes of Google and Microsoft.
Pros: Decent Compensation
Lot of Technologies to work on if given a chance
Free and decent food (have to pay for snacks)
If one performs well in their competency test, he/she is very valued and given a choice to choose any team
Some teams are really good with very competent people who really care about career growth of a fresher(I was fortunate to get into one such team)

Cons: Contractors and Permanent staff getting treated differently with training, going to summer and Christmas events.

Really bad career progression.

Manager hasnt really bothered taking time hiring quality staff.

Zero experience staff joining the company at higher rank and higher salary
Advice: Its really bad to see staff members been put through there paces to apply for promotion or managerial role only to find someone with no training experience, no relevant background been put forward to a higher management position. Only because they knew someone higher in the company to be put forward for the role. Dont be surprised if you see someones, friend, husband or wife join the company only because they wanted the money and not the job. This hasnt once, its happen multiple times.

Internal recruitment and HR have to put up with it and then having to give some long winded speech on why they are better then you. HR and internal recruitment are just bad people and they will fold down to upper management to decide who enters Samsung. 
Its really embarrassing and I feel bad for some of the more highly talented people I worked with to hear them say that to me. Unfortunately, nine times out of ten, they would just leave and find better jobs who respect there talent rather then who they know in the company.

Samsung can make the company better but because the work culture in some departments is basically: “No one cares what you think”. Theres no point in working in such harsh conditions.
Theres a also a bully culture at Samsung which again, why no one speaks about it? Its simple: HR doesnt care and wont do anything about it. 

Enjoy working with talentless people.
Pros: Some good people to work with

Samsung looks nice on your CV

Pros: The highest level of compensation, working conditions,

Cons: Greater Samsung business does not understand Enterprise business
No Work life balance - expect to work 60-80 hours every week if you don't want to fall behind
Customers are affected because the consumer processes are forced on an enterprise business and they don't work the same way.
Higher priority on internal reports, meetings and training even to the point of having field sales people cancel customer meetings in favour of internal requirements
Flexible working policy is frowned upon - must be in the office if not at customer meetings  even though the company is selling mobility as their main go to market in Enterprise space. 
Internal policies and approval chains put needless overheads and inefficiencies on the business. Eg not allowed network connection through ethernet on other floors in office, only your own. Must apply to take laptop out of office every couple of months.
Advice: Learn from other enterprise businesses - how they go to market and their processes.
Don't just talk about work life balance - allow staff to achieve it with reasonable expectations
Allow field sales to be out talking to customers - sales 101! manage internal requirements better (again - just look at the way other businesses manage this).
If they got this right, Samsung would be a force to reckon with - but they are sabotaging their own business with processes and lack of understanding
Pros: Samsung has great innovative products and the team I was in was great and supportive. Pay and benefits were good such as fuel card, car allowance, corporate card etc.

2.intensely horizontal organization - too many procurers to adopt new technology
3.great follower but not bold enough to be the first mover
Advice: None
Pros: 1.intense and well-organized job orientation and education that would be beneficial for fresh graduates and undergraduate

Cons: No cons, as I said
Advice: None
Pros: Remote, stable, good relations, Confucian values

Cons: I found many and few are as below - 
1. No work Culture.

2. Now a days new trend is "Test". They have many level of test and if you are not able to clear those test you might loss your job and test is not relevant to your work at all.Test is the level of like you are working for "NASA".

3.Origin of politics is rating - They have annual rating to employees from 1 to 5.(1 is best 5 is worst).For that they need to maintain Bell curve.Which results around 25% employee will fall in to rating 4 & 5. End result is No hike for those employee and they have maximum 2~4 months to get a new job as HR will start asking to them to search a new Job they will thrown out of projects.Though if you get 1 or 2 rating no issue at all.
If you are a new joiner then you have fair enough chances to get 4 & 5 rating.

4. No work life balance you have to complete 8.30 hours in side office barrier not doing this will effect your salary.So if you have work or not you have to be there in office.

5. Management is not so effective(Both Indian and Korean).

6.  No new technologies to work on.

7. Current environment of company is - Most of trying to get new job outside or preparing for Test.No one is interested in work.

8. Engineers have least values.

9. Most of employees are working here due to NCR as they have home near by apart from that no reasons. Including mine also.
Advice: Introduce some better policies.
No to try how to irritate individuals.
Pros: 1. Free Food.
2. Free AC Transport.
3. Money if you are getting good ratings.

Cons: Samsung does not have any clear plan to grow and overcome competitors, so time to time you meet illogical business decisions. Lot's of respect to all kind of formalities: if you are older and have some certificates you will likely to always have better performance grades, and your actual performance does not really counts. HQ is company for koreans - all good learning opportunities and resources are provided on Korean only. Work emails are in Korean. If you don't know Korean you will probably know all the news in the very last moment. If you project looks not important to VP you can have no work tasks for half year and that's ok. Situation IS changing to better side, but far from perfect. So I can recommend Samsung only to mentally stable people - still, work is interesting and living in Korea is great.
Advice: Have strength to risk. You tell lots of good things - about becoming more software then hardware company, about becoming "start-up" etc. Still there is almost no action because you fear to risk. You need to have some loud risky project that will blow up a business - small changes don't count any more.
Pros: Lots of different projects across the company to work on. Samsung owns more different businesses that you can imaging. If you find the project you are interested in, you can have opportunity to work with world-wide data and implement this project in millions devices across the world. Great benefit package for expats - flat provided, free meals, free transport etc.

Manager and higher management incapable of decision making leading to discouragement of inquisitive minds.
Advice: None
Pros: Reliable &amp; Expanding Manufacturing Job fits good.

Cons: Very rigid Korean control of key decisions and processes, yet can be incredibly chaotic and disorganised at the coal face. Needs better local control and a wider range of input.
Obsessive IT systems security and rigid approval processes are both obstructive to day to day activities.
Tends to produce employees of extremes - either Samsung-worshipping workaholics who you expect to find dead at their desks one morning, or people who use the vast structure and ever-present disorganisation to actually do very little. Very few "normal" people who work hard, and deliver on commitments, but go home on time and don't live and breathe the job.
Advice: Foster better relations between Korean and Western employees. Too much of a "them and us" culture, with an ever-present feeling among Western employees that we can never be as trusted or as valued as the Koreans. The company could also make much better use of the experience of your non-Korean employees to improve business processes and approaches to new markets, such as business to business sales. The very heavy dictation from Korea, and a tendency for Koreans to ignore or override Western input, often with no consultation or notice can be quite wearing. It does sometimes feel that this is not a global company, but a Korean company that operates globally.

All the decisions are made by the Top management. Local managements do not have the power to make even simple decisions. They expect all staffs to work long hours, without overtime compensation and deems it as standard in office not to leave on the dot. They do not praise staffs for work well done, but instead, will be asking for more to be done. This is not good for Employee's morale as they were not praised for the work they've done. They require you to sacrifice family time for company activities.
Advice: The top management to give full authorities to local managements. They are paid to make decisions and plans, not to just follow what the managements says.
Pros: They are willing to train you for the job, even if you don't have the experience. It's a good work environment as all the colleagues are very helpful and friendly. They provided alot alot of chance for regional travels. There is opportunities to meet with all customers and suppliers. They provide good exposures as meeting face to face with suppliers and customers provide you with more knowledge and better understanding of the business. They also have rewards those staffs that they feel has performed well, by providing them with cash rewards but that is only decided by the Top management and only if they like you.

Cons: Possibly the worst decision ever in my professional career.  I was an experienced expat hire having previously worked for other top companies (APPLE, MSFT, GOOGLE...take your pick).  Worked for Samsung Mobile marketing...you know the group that puts those dog and pony shows with Korean executives speaking with their poorly spoken English. This place will absolutely rot your soul.  You will wonder every day of your stringent 1.5 or 2 year contract, what you are doing there; why you are there; and how to kill time.  Every minute of your mandatory 10 hour days (yes, they track your hours and you will get an incomplete if you do not put in your full 10 hours).  Yes, you have to go through an airport security system and put your bags through an X-ray machine.  i could go on and on.  But the most important point is that as a professional hire, you will regress.  While you are rotting away in Suwon with absolutely nothing to do, your colleagues back home will be moving up progressively or have worked on something amazing. For more details please check out a book called Noonchi:  The Appearance of Working in a South Korean Chaebol for the painful details.  Yes, a former employee wrote a tell-all expose because it was the only way to keep sane.
Advice: learn english
