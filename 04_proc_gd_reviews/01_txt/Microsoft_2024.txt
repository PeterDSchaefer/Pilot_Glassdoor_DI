Cons: Pay not as competitive. Can be better
Advice: None
Pros: Great work life balance
Good comp off
Great leadership team

Cons: Because top pay and frequent failure go hand in hand, the orgs are political. Many directors, general managers and some of the VPs are more motivated to protect their status and compensation instead of trying to improve the organization. And so the hardware groups fail and lose money. 

The worst is the politics that arise due to leaders protecting themselves. And folks deep down know they are less deserving of accolades and higher pay and bonuses than their peers in other industries. So while they post how amazing hogging out space for a motherboard on an aluminum brick is, they avoid mirrors that will reveal the truth. They are locusts.

And finally, internally it was admitted that the company wants to get rid of all white men over 45. As a hiring manager
I took a class in which the instructor stated that. And recruiters also told me that they were not allowed to present resumes to me of anyone over 50.
Advice: Drop pay and benefits to what other engineers and managers make in other industries making physical products. 
And get rid of every director and VP and start over.  
Pros: For mechanical and electrical engineers, pay is 2x to 3X what any non tech company pays. And an engineer is less accountable because the hardware teams expect to fail. 
Benefits are premium. Best 401k match on the planet. Health benefit of $3,000 to spend on bikes, hiking and fitness gear etc. Beer kegs exist in most project rooms. And there’s no need to advance your skills beyond what you learned in college. They run their hardware orgs like college design projects not like commercial product development companies.

Cons: You know how Microsoft is supposed to be the chill big tech company with a great work life balance? That might be true in some sections of the company, but my team and the org around us was not that. At one point we hired someone from AWS to the team, and after a few months she left to return to her old job because the work life balance was so much better. Our WLB score on the employee survey was 20/100, whereas the average across all of Microsoft was 75/100. Microsoft pay isn't enough to put up with the BS we had to deal with.

I used to think that they cared a good deal about diversity and inclusion, until they laid off their entire DEI team
Advice: honestly, not much lower level management can do because the org is so political. If you step out of line, you get managed out by the leadership team.
Pros: I loved all the benefits provided by Microsoft. It was honestly hard to keep track of everything to ensure that I got the value out of it all, but that's a good problem to have

Cons: Slow, process heavy, too many layers of management.
Advice: After a decade of culture turnaround Microsoft has started to slip. Culture is taking more of a backseat to profit at (almost) all costs (see recent moves away from climate promises and DEI) Maintaining margins and returning value to shareholders have become leading indicators instead of lagging indicators and the output of great culture. Layoffs have impacted those who have been let go as well as pretty much everone else in terms of morale. I suspect all this is very much by design but my advice would be stop it. Get back to focusing on culture and mission. The damage, however,  is already done and slow decline is a potential outcome. Microsoft will continue to be a great place to work but not quite as great as it was. The risk is that if a decline does kick in, management will double down on the non-cultural aspects, which will accelerate the decline. See Boeing as a cautionary tale. 
Pros: Great benefits, great mission, great people, great campuses.

Cons: - New layoff season makes no position feel secure
- Although the company says they champion work-life balance, it is still commonplace to work into the evenings/weekends to make deadlines
- Poor management trickles down and negatively impacts everyday experiences
- Wishy-washy decision making on an SLT level often makes product direction unclear (too much emphasis on following other tech companies, always feels like we're behind)
- Company is far too heavily invested in AI today and letting other experiences fall by the wayside
- Annoying mandatory, bi-annual, self-reflective Connects that add unnecessary pressure (often during already-busy season)
Advice: • The company should be more concerned about what is best for users rather than chasing trends in AI and finding more opportunities for additional revenue, adding to an even more bloated experience
• The company's overconfidence in AI is cheapening experiences across the board rather than helping make them better
• Connects should be measured by employee contributions and merits rather than an essay on why business goals were or weren't achieved.
Pros: + Flexible hybrid/remote
+ Competitive salary
+ Deferred time off (DTO) (some may prefer PTO)

Cons: Zero job security or advancement:

Reviews only happen twice a year. I worked there for 2.5 years with "no budget for raises or promotions". One or two people in the entire org got promoted once a year. After my first year, there was an internal hiring freeze that kept anyone from even changing teams.

Shortly after my fourth glowing performance review, I was part of the 10k people laid off in spring 2023. Though the announcement was made in January, the layoffs were rolling for months. I was a part of the very last ones, laid off in a group of 12 people by my 5th level skip, to make room for more people to work on their terrible AI. 

Disorganized chaos:

Agile/scrum is industry standard but it still hasn't caught on at Microsoft. If you need structure, clear requirements, etc., make sure that's something the team you're going to join cares about. My org only started doing *quarterly* planning for engineering in late 2022.

I'm back as a contractor now in a different org and it's actually even worse. They don't even do quarterly planning.

Every organization and team have different cultures around planning, expectations, documentation, etc. If you're thinking about joining make sure to talk to your individual manager about it.
Advice: There's a reason Agile is the industry standard for engineering. 

Also, your AI copilot is terrible and I can't figure out how to turn it off. It's possible you can't once your org opts into it. 
Pros: Engaging and motivating work. My family and friends loved telling people I worked there. The pay and benefits are amazing as well. Theoretically there's a lot of room to grow and change teams. It looks good on my resume now.

Cons: After Microsoft acquired the company I previously worked for, the organizational changes rolled through in waves, causing a sense of instability for employees. (This was not unfounded as evidenced by multiple rounds of layoffs). 

Movement to a new position or role within the company is difficult without knowing someone who can facilitate the transition.
Advice: None
Pros: Terrific benefits with unlimited "discretionary time off," wellness perks, and much more. Many learning opportunities to grow within your role. There are also a lot of ways to connect with your team, and there is never a shortage of work - you will never be bored!

Cons: Never report misconduct or inappropriate behavior by managers to HR. Their primary role is to protect the company. During job eliminations, severance packages are designed to ensure your silence.
Advice: Prioritize Ethics: Emphasize the importance of ethical leadership and hold all managers accountable to the same standards of conduct.

Support Employees: Ensure HR practices are genuinely supportive of employees' well-being, rather than solely protecting the company's interests.
Pros: Great benefits, and overall, team members are fantastic to work with.

Cons: The size and complexity of the organization can sometimes lead to bureaucratic processes and slower decision-making. Navigating through various departments can be challenging.
Advice: Simplify internal processes to enhance efficiency and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy. Encourage cross-departmental collaboration to streamline workflows and improve communication.
Pros: Microsoft offers a dynamic and innovative work environment with access to cutting-edge technology and resources. The company culture promotes continuous learning and professional growth.
Employees enjoy excellent benefits, including comprehensive health plans, generous vacation time, and opportunities for remote work. The work-life balance is highly valued and supported.

Cons: High Pressure and Expectations:

Intense workload and high expectations for performance and productivity.
Potential for long working hours, especially during project deadlines.
Corporate Bureaucracy:

Large company structure can lead to bureaucratic processes and slower decision-making.
Potential for feeling like a small cog in a big machine.
Work-Life Balance Challenges:

Despite flexible options, the high demands of the job may impact personal time and work-life balance.
Intense Competition:

Competitive work environment with high achievers can be stressful.
Pressure to continuously perform at a high level to stand out.
Location and Commute:

Depending on the location of the campus, commuting can be time-consuming and stressful.
Cost of living in some areas, like Redmond or Seattle, can be high.
Potential for Burnout:

High-pressure environment and intense workload can lead to burnout if not managed properly.
Need for self-care and stress management to maintain long-term productivity and well-being.
Limited Scope of Work:

Possibility of being confined to specific projects or roles, limiting exposure to a variety of experiences.
Specialization in certain areas may restrict opportunities to explore other interests.
Advice: None
Pros: Competitive Salary and Benefits:

Microsoft offers attractive compensation packages, including competitive salaries, bonuses, stock options, and comprehensive health benefits.

Opportunities for continuous learning and development through internal training programs, conferences, and courses.
Access to cutting-edge technology and tools.
Innovative Work Environment:

Exposure to the latest advancements in technology and software development.

On-campus amenities such as fitness centers, cafes, and wellness programs to support a healthy work-life balance.
Diverse and Inclusive Culture:

Commitment to diversity and inclusion with various employee resource groups and initiatives.
Collaborative work environment with a focus on teamwork and innovation.
Career Advancement Opportunities:

Pros: Great company culture- D&amp;I, growth mindset, amazing benefits, enjoyed teamwork and collaboration, etc.

Cons: Things move slowly here at MSFT just like most big tech companies
Advice: NA
Pros: you work on good things - AI is the buzzword and there is no better place than MSFT to explore and work on AI

Cons: none that I can think of at the moment
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and work-life balance

Cons: On-calls for azure can be tough. 
Stagnant at times - promotions seem longevity based rather than result/contribution based.
Advice: Focus on developing productive team members and reducing overheads.
Pros: Good product. Work life balance. Good community. Better for those looking to stay at their current leveling

Cons: 1. Lack of transparency from leadership
2. Unclear directives
3. Agile and constantly changing work demands, leading to quicker burnout within role.
Advice: None
Pros: 1. Valuable stocks driven by AI demand
2. Remote Work
3. Decent Salary

Cons: Company culture is very structured and a bit old school for a tech company. It can be very inflexible and lead to often wasting time on processes/following up with people.
Advice: Make your culture more friendly for the younger workforce as they are your future. The old guard is holding you back and often scaring off new talent
Pros: Company so very stable and they often hire from within, so it’s very easy to jump within the company. Also people there have a lot of tenure on their roles typically, so you’re working with true experts most of the time

Cons: Inter-group politics hasn't gone away at all
Lot of focus on optics than actual progress
Advice: Focus on delivering good products instead of personal growth all the time
Imbibe the spirit of changes (people, process, product) instead of just optics while still doing the old things
Pros: Potential for decent work life balance
Opportunity to impact lives of substantial population

Cons: I can't think of any cons.
Advice: None
Pros: I loved the team and projects I was involved in. I had good compensation, great benefits and work environment.

Cons: At the time there could be long working hours.
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work, I left in 2005. Driven, smart, dedicated employees that get the job done. Training opps and internal job movement opps.

Cons: no any cons of mlsa are there
Advice: None
Pros: azure cloud service monthly and githubpro

Cons: No salary increases, too much politics to grow, hidden messages and lack of trust. Leadership cant be trusted, they change your metrics at the end of the year.
Advice: Take care of your employees. Stop with the VWYF BS. You are hurting the company and thats why lots of customers are not even renewing unified contracts.
Pros: You have unlimited PTO and you can be layback

Cons: Poorly managed, purely on financials
Advice: Stop managing and start leading the business.  Leaders are only managers, managing to financial numbers
Pros: Smart people, great technologies, leaders in Gen AI

Cons: Leadership lacks vision, skills, empowerment and empathy. Turned into a super toxic place and narcissists are getting promoted and rewarded for maniging out top performers which they don't like. Favoritism is at unseen levels and good 'ole boys clubs wherever you are. I was proud to work for this company but the CEO and Senior Leadership Team ruined the culture. Salary is also pretty weak compared to competitors. Previously, good WLB made up for it but that is completely gone, and so are all the good benefits. Sadly, it turned into a terrible place to work for!
Advice: Get rid of all those toxic managers which are standing in the way of success and ruining other people's live. Stand behind your words. Culture is just a word here to disguise the devils
Pros: Remote work. Other than that nothing else comes to my mind anymore since all the good benefits and pride to work for this company has gone away

Cons: They work you to death... and it is getting more and more common across the company.
Advice: None
Pros: Working with cutting edge technology and with very smart and driven people

Cons: While the pay is competitive, they seem to lag behind a few other companies in the industry
Advice: None
Pros: Great product breadth, industry expertise and leaders in quite a few areas. It also provides great wlb

Cons: You can be laid off at any time, just like at Google. Salaries are not as competitive as they used to be because companies know everyone needs a job now. There are constant reorganizations, and new managers bring new visions and new work requirements. It's important to track all of your kudos because you have to show each new manager why you are valuable. It would be nice if a track record of top reviews was all you needed, but you shouldn't get too attached to what you’re doing.
The last big layoff, Satya and his LT flew to Aspen Great place to learn. Some good hearted people to work with. Some super lazy toxic people who play the political game too
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to learn. Some good hearted people to work with. Some super lazy toxic people who play the political game too. Make sure you work to live not the other way around.

Cons: The work is compelling, but the frequent deadlines and scheduled tasks can make it tough to fully utilize the valuable learning resources available.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft offers a wealth of internal resources that provide excellent learning opportunities. Having worked on multiple teams, I've experienced a high level of collaboration and support. The company's culture fosters innovation and professional development, making it an outstanding place to grow your career.

Cons: Certain managers exhibit a tendency towards meticulous scrutiny. Failing to navigate their expectations adeptly and engage in the necessary political maneuvering may lead to a challenging work environment that inhibits creative freedom.
Advice: None
Pros: You can expect competitive pay, excellent benefits, smart team members and a culture of research-only team meetings that enables continuous improvement and growth. Many colleagues share their work for feedback and present on topics that interest them.

Cons: - Can be "clickish," if you are not a member of the "A Team"
Advice: - Immediately express concerns to your Manager
Pros: - Great Pay
- Ability to work from home

Cons: Politics, unclear asks, poor processes, every changing priorities, lot of bureaucratic, cut throat, sub par upper management, they value term spent with company over quality, every person for themselves, no team culture, it's all for themselves and not for customer
Advice: start thinking of customer and then your team and then for yourself.
Pros: Good brand on resume! Learning opportunities

Cons: The work is interesting, but with constantly scheduled deliverables and deadlines it can be challenging to take advantage of the great resources the company provides. It's important for you to make the time for personal growth.
Advice: Work with the team to make sure people have time to participate in growth experiences.  For a developer a great way to do this is to actively participate in Hackathons.  I think that management could be more supportive and encouraging for people to participate in them, and should schedule them more frequently.  I previously worked at a company that initially reserved one Friday a month for everyone to participate in hackathons, this evolved over time to a full week every few months (3 or 4 times per year).  That allowed time to create significant projects and the company greatly benefited from that.
Pros: Microsoft has so many internal resources with great opportunities for learning. I've worked on various teams and there is a lot of interesting work and contributions are valued. One of the many things the company values is a growth mindset and we regularly look at and discuss our process and take steps to improve them. Each team has the flexibility to do this in the manner that works best for them. We also have lots of great opportunities for cross team collaboration and it's fun to work with other teams and learn about how they do things.

Cons: Every job posting receives 100+ resumes from both internal and external candidates, so external applicants have a high barrier of entry unless they know someone who can make an intro or have such a perfected resume that it gets past HR filters and to the desk of a hiring manager that has at most 10-30 seconds to look at it.

Specific to cybersecurity, Microsoft tends to hire more experienced people and needs to do a better job growing early in career cybersecurity professionals.
Advice: Managers and leadership all the way up the chain need to do a much better job of holding their direct reports, peers, and their own managers accountable when they fail to meet basic ethical standards.
Pros: Excellent internal learning resources and active social communities, support for fully remote work in most cases. You get exposure to vast knowledge bases to help understand advanced technologies and access to people who can explain it so their grandparents would understand. 
I've had very positive relationships with my managers, and even in times of upheaval, our leadership tends to index towards clarity with the general staff.

Cons: Depending on role, the work bandwidth may affect on being able to work on career development
Advice: None
Pros: Great support from mgmt for a career development path, mentorship programs, certifications, etc

Cons: There are some cons but you may think as a opportunity to learn and develop patience
Advice: None
Pros: Best work life balance in fast paced environment

Cons: I worked at Microsoft for 10 years and my entire team was laid off after being relocated to this office after a promotion. This happened due to a corporate restelructure although the my organization I was in was profitable and core to Microsoft. They have lost their culture and focus on security at the expense of AI/proft. They take away your tools to encourage resignations during layoffs rather than pay severance. They do not live their values. Have your resume updated at all times and constantly upskill/find new certifications or you won't last long.
Advice: Change your espoused values. Stop promoting a fake culture. Take care of your people, and change middle management. You should not layoff 10,000 people in order to build a short term moat around AI at the expense of security and long term success. You have ruined many people's careers and mental health for short term profitability.
Pros: Great pay and benefits. Work life balance.

Cons: Large company with lots of products and resources to comb through as you need things. 
Hard to stand out as a team lead or get recognition because of the amount of employees in the groups.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay, professional employees, diversity and inclusion, work life balance

Cons: N/A, pay can always be more competitive but the WLB is more worth it for me.
Advice: None
Pros: Great WLB, competitive compensation, good culture

Cons: Because corporate changed their minds on things seemingly all the time, it was hard to build any kind of trust in them. Plus, when you see your teammates get laid off all the time, you're in a constant state of fear. Plus, because people never really audited our databases, there was a lot of duplicates that an audit would have fixed-- I feel like a lot of people would have never been hired if they had done an audit, and then that would have prevented a lot of layoffs.
Also, I was paid SIGNIFICANTLY lower than my counterparts.
Advice: Think things through before making major changes. And please, audit your information for accuracy. 
Pros: Benefits were amazing. My direct boss was great. On an individual level, it was quite good.

Cons: Too much politics and hard to work with manager sometimes
Advice: None
Pros: Awesome salary and grow to do

Cons: It can be challenging to move around within the company depending on your expertise
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits, coworkers, flexible hours and salary

Cons: Lots of deadlines for several projects at the same time. Often times, we're told we can move deadlines, but many times we're pushed to still get things done.
Advice: None
Pros: I have a great set of managers. They understand that a healthy WLB allows me to work efficiently and not get burned out.

Cons: Too much "bottom-up" methodology. Not enough high level guidance. Management overworked and so a bit inaccessible. Lots of arguably unnecessary bureaucracy. While the desire there, displayed care for employees is questionable.
Advice: Be honest with yourselves about the skillset needed to be a good manager and leader. And be particular about who you promote up to leadership positions as well - a good employee is not always a great manager/leader. Also a great manager isn't always a great leader and vice versa. 
Pros: Salary. Benefits. Varying scale of projects and interesting problems to solve. Desire to care for employees.

Cons: Large, opportunities for young people, can be difficult to navigate.
Advice: Keep it up and focus on people and our impact on the world.
Pros: Innovation, drive, focus on Security, People, technology. Benefits. Ability to influence. Best company I've worked with.

Cons: Corporate processes can be cumbersome
Advice: None
Pros: Career advancement
Dynamic environment
Compensation 
Diversity and Inclusion

Cons: It´s a very intense rythm of work
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, we live the mission of the company every day.

Cons: Don't you guys have anything better to do
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing,wonderful, why you gotta make me do this just to look at some salaries

Cons: Choose Microsoft for it's WLB even they offer less money. If you get hired by Azure or BAP(business application), just run, WLB is a joke in those two departments. For internal transfer, it is the same as external interview.
Advice: None
Pros: Big name as a step stone for first big tech job

Cons: Not enough free time to slap the ham.
Advice: None
Pros: Good food and tasty treats

Cons: The company is quite large, you can feel like leadership isn't paying attention to your organization.
Advice: None
Pros: The benefits package is unmatched, I really enjoyed working with my team.

Cons: Your direct manager, skip level and your team's culture directly affects your experience working at Microsoft. Depending on which department, it could be hit or miss.
Advice: None
Pros: A wide range of products to work on. If you don't just need a job but care about/interested in certain areas of software development, you'll find something at Microsoft.

Cons: Pay is a little low
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and work culture

Cons: cold environment in Seattle winter
Advice: None
Pros: Good work environment good benefits

Cons: Getting promoted is difficult and the company goes through reorganizations and layoffs frequently.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft has great benefits and a lot of opportunities to move to different roles internally.

Cons: I cannot think of anything at the moment.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance and culture.

Cons: Sometimes Microsoft can't commit to fund a project internally, but will turn around and spend 100X to buy a start up that did the same thing a year later. New VPs like to kill the previous VPs initiatives, like a lion taking over a pride killing the cubs, they want to be seen as the source of the vision and leadership, not a babysitter of someone else's idea, even if that idea was brilliant.
Advice: None
Pros: The pay is great, very nice people, almost anything you want to work on in the technical space is available there, so switching around doesn't require switching companies.

Cons: Be aware of which organization you land in if you care a lot about Work Life boundary. E.g the cloud business is doing fantastic yet work load can def be a lot. so i wouldn't say this is a con but really depends on what each individual is looking for.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company that continues to promote trust, customer obsession. Although the company compensation is not at the top but they provide great employee benefits to take care of their employees such as great 401(K) match, fitness/health spend, great healthcare insurance. 

each company has issues that they need to work on so of course Microsoft is not excluded. Yet i think at least they try to recognize the issue they are facing and take action to address even if it can take some time to address or see the outcome.

Cons: None to mention. Maybe more vacation
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work with good benefits

Cons: Hard to transition roles internally.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay, benefits, and work life balance

Cons: lots of travelling, many new faces
Advice: None
Pros: Nice career options and great care

Cons: *Terrible WLB. Kiss your family-life and hobbies goodbye. Pay atleast 30% less than big Tech peers for many/most roles.
*Early morning and post-dinner calls with Asian countries happen regularly. 
*You could be managed-out or laid off for no reason, because they over-hired in 2021-2022.
*Internal team transfer is tougher than external job switching, strife with discreet nepotism and opacity.
Advice: You're making record profits with the whole AI surge. Please stop managing-out people for fun (and greed), and treating your employees like a cost line-item in a spreadsheet.
Pros: *Senior leadership has been making the right strategic moves in recent years.

Cons: Less Chances to promotion and takes longer time
Advice: None
Pros: Good environment and culture
Good worklife balance
Friendly colleagues

Cons: A lot of opportunists, profiting from the working people, big mouths, visibility experts, and flatter geniuses. MS is a big company and certainly doesn't care for your well being, they cannot afford to care for you, so if you go there, know what you want, take it, give back, and leave when you feel confident enough. Terrible/negative/atrocious HR and management.
Advice: None
Pros: One of the largest technology companies. Learning opportunities.

Cons: Salary can be higher in the industry
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits, culture, work life balance

Cons: We do a 24/7 oncall which is super bad. The system is quite legacy so all you do is sdk/infra migration, security patch, and pray for the change won't break anything otherwise you will get paged at night.
Advice: None
Pros: My manager is a good guy.

Cons: No cons, I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Good place to work, respectufl, benefits

Cons: It can be very pushy sometimes. Working pace is fast. You need to learn how to handle stress here.
Advice: None
Pros: Great working environment with intelligent colleagues collaborating together.

Cons: If you are a transfer from india they take advantage of you and pay very less, Also salary ranges in Canada is too less compared to US
Advice: None
Pros: Pay range in India is good comparatively

Cons: Difficult to move to other jobs within company, large to navigate.
Advice: None
Pros: On the cutting edge, relevant and long-term vision.

Cons: Promotions are extremely hard
They don't really do product. It's all mostly Program. Product is just a title for most areas of MSFT. It's a very traditional org so changes will be slow.
Advice: Don't lay off when you realize you made a mistake in putting the candidate in a role he had said he doesnt have skills for. 
When you layoff, dont take laptop away. Look at what Walmart does to help their displaced people find another role within Walmart. Your "Microsoft provides you help once you are laid off, is merely a lips stick."
Pros: People (very family oriented, very helpful, very humble)
Benefits (though salary / bonus / stocks are lower than other FAANGs)
Mobility within the company

Cons: Stay away from the Data and AI roles if there is a SQL Server component to the job. You are expected to audit (through a cloud economics assessment) 20% of customers per year minimum. 

There are many terrible managers who have no view of their direct reports other than a cog in the wheel. Reviews and level of engagement has more to do with personal relationships and favoritism than actual results.
Advice: None
Pros: If in the right role with the right manager the interactions with customers and Microsoft leaders is great. Benefits are top notch and comparable with all of the big tech companies.

Cons: Quite competitive but overall this is the best place I could ever ask for
Advice: None
Pros: High salary, there's a lots to learn

Cons: Company culture can be cut throat
Advice: Don’t try to make teams compete against each other
Pros: Hybrid work environment. Good salary

Cons: Internal transfer same as applying from outside
Advice: None
Pros: Good learning opportunities and good benefits

Cons: I haven’t seen any yet
Advice: None
Pros: Great mentorship and leadership
Great with work life balance

Cons: Like any large organization, your employee experience depends heavily on your manager and leadership team. I was fortunate to have a great set of leaders.
Advice: Keep focusing on growth mindset.
Pros: Microsoft has come a long way in shifting its culture this past decade. I am thrilled to have been part of that.

Cons: Slow working teams. Lots of bureaucracy
Advice: None
Pros: good culture and work life balance

Cons: One's success and happiness depends on your relationship with your manager. Sometimes, managers like or dislike someone regardless of their meeting of targets. Doesn't give the feeling of a meritocasy
Advice: None
Pros: Great company, values, benefits, nice colleagues

Cons: So much work it's hard to keep up
Advice: None
Pros: Pretty good place to work

Cons: As at any big company there are a lot of employees
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance, compensation, benefits

Cons: Lower compensation than peers; lack of career-path transparency; not innovative.
Advice: Tell the truth. If the company makes a change to make more money, say so. Just an example: everybody knows that the reason for replacing accrued vacation time with discretionary vacation is to remove a liability from the books, not to give employees more flexibility. Be honest.

Clearly state your vision for company culture. Are we moving back to the days of the infamous "guns pointing at each other" poster? I see the louder mouths getting ahead. Is that what it takes? If the answer is yes, fine. One way or another, say it, so employees can make informed decisions about their careers.

Don't be wobbly, stick to the plan and own it. We lost on the internet, search, cell phones, and AR not because of engineering failures, but lack of direction and vision. Today, we are riding on the AI wave, but we get our models from OpenAI and even Meta. We don't make our own chips, unlike NVIDIA and even Google. It is OK if we are the tortoise, who after all wins the race, but again, say so. Don't pretend we are going all out swinging on innovation, when our talent is to perform well on the difficult job of incremental and solid engineering.
Pros: Work-to-life balance; still a friendly culture; good engineering.

Cons: Dont learn much
Ceiling on growth
Advice: None
Pros: Chill culture
Can take days off whenever

Cons: Low pay, legacy code base
Advice: None
Pros: Stably growing, good business leadership, good benefits

Cons: No free food or snacks
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits and the salary is good

Cons: There's no overall company culture here, it's just too big. The culture of one team is different than the others.
Advice: None
Pros: I learned a lot working here and my coworkers were great.

Cons: Takes forever to move up, bad leadership
Advice: 
Pros: Title says it all, wanted to quit for a while but had the golden handcuffs on

Cons: direction can be more defined
Advice: None
Pros: culture and speed is good

Cons: A lot of older guard workers are resistant to improving the engineering process. PMs dominate the show at the cost of SDEs - you will be pushed to deliver buggy releases to angry customers, prioritize features over bug fixes, and then marked down for spending so much time on-call fixing the problems PMs pushed you to ship. There is no extra compensation or time-off for on-call, just pressure. 

Build and deployment processes are slapdash and flaky - expect to wait multiple hours for a build and deployment only for a transient failure to require you to stay late and retry (and expect those failures multiple times per month). Build and deployment process filled with poorly maintained and poorly documented shell scripts. 

Culture of rushed delivery and constant hotfixes, even worse if you're on a service team like Azure. You will not get extra compensation for all of this pressure, and the teams will stay understaffed. 

There are a lot of "bad apples" distributed all over in high positions. Female employees might feel uncomfortable speaking up about their managers leering at their body (as I have), and if spoken up about, little is done for years. Covert racism if you're not white. 

I was in a team under C+AI and we kept losing people and couldn't retain anyone - despite being a crucial and visible part of the ecosystem. Why did people want to leave, and why did people keep getting burned out? We kept losing mostly senior engineers and keeping junior ones, and mostly losing women too. Even if it's not deliberate, you should ask why attrition and poor retention affected those groups the most.
Advice: Actually allow genuinely anonymous feedback where engineers can report concerns without their managers being able to take their words and de-anonymize. Managers frequently berate IC's (individual contributors) for giving negative feedback without speaking up non-anonymously about what to do about it. This makes IC's hide problems instead of reporting them. Multiple times, we had multiple senior SDEs report concerns about maintainability of product launches before they happened, only for our skip-level manager to mention that not a single mention reached them at all - this speaks to the lack of influence individual SDEs have compared to managers and PMs.
Pros: You're around very smart engineers from global teams working together. There are a lot of genuinely hardworking, cooperative, kind engineers that make everyday work so much smoother and easier. Good perks and generally calm atmosphere outside of your team (people are usually nice). Pay is decent, less than other big tech companies obviously, but you get a better work-life balance as a trade. Honestly, you're only here for the pay, the generally ok work-life balance compared to industry, and those good teammates who you will treasure.

Cons: Career progression happens very slowly.
Advice: Always look for opportunities to get senior and junior engineers to collaborate more.
Pros: supportive manager that gives constructive feedback

Advice: None
Pros: Love the growth mindset in the org

Cons: Be prepared for terrible management, inconsistent opportunities, and politics all over. Nothing works the way it could because nobody wants to be the one to say what is broken. Fifedoms are the name of the game, the more heads you lead the less you care to help your teams.
Advice: Being technically efficient has nothing to do with being a manager. Many managers are just politicians and don't actually care about their employees they just want to say they made their employee improve for some made up BS so they coached them and are awesome. Model, Coach, and Care is BS when they burn everyone out.
Pros: Great name recognition, great benefits, and decent pay.

Cons: The leadership team seems disorganized and unclear on strategic direction, leading to constant churn and re-orgs. A lot of people have been there for 20+ years, creating a somewhat old-fashioned culture. Slow to move/not very innovative.

Advice: None
Pros: OK product, good place to learn and grow

Cons: While the company culture overall is good and they try to emphasize good values, it’s a huge company so you can have a vast difference in experience depending on where you work. If you’re interviewing, make sure you meet with your hiring manager, evaluate them and ask questions about the culture of the team. 
A lot of work is still Seattle centric which makes it difficult to be visible if you’re new and remote, impacting promotions, influence, etc.
If you’re getting hired for a PM position, make sure you understand what is expected from the role. It looks vastly different depending on the product and its needs. I would recommend staying away from products that aren’t growing, especially as a PM.
Advice: None
Pros: As far as big corporations go, Microsoft is one of the best ones to work. The company culture is overall great. They emphasize a growth mindset and try to care about people. They have strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion which helps everyone think about how to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment. The pay and benefits are competitive. Because of all the products they work on, you can work on different products and move teams without leaving the company. They’re also making a lot of great strategic decisions which gives me faith in the leadership and direction they’re headed.

Cons: boring work
no growth
politics
Advice: None

Cons: * Difficult environment for innovation. Microsoft tends to be better at improving existing products than creating new ones. Microsoft puts a lot of effort into innovating, but it often reorganizes, changes directions, or cancels projects before things can pan out.
* Lots of meetings and process that comes with being a large company that has to coordinate between teams.
* Although this isn't generally the case, some "old Microsoft" teams can be very stressful and power struggles between teams and leaders are common.
Advice: None
Pros: * Ability to switch jobs internally within Microsoft to work on all different kinds of projects in all areas of software. Different teams have different cultures and practices, so look for a team that's a good match for you.
* In general, the culture is improving on customer focus and growth mindset. Although management can be political and chaotic, the folks at the ground level generally are supportive of each other and stiving to make the best, most positive products that they can.
* Lots of resources to do things on a large scale and have a big impact.
* Microsoft takes ethics seriously and has a real commitment to doing the right thing.

Cons: No training bad management no structure
Advice: None
Pros: Easy work life balance and decent pay

Cons: Lots of stress and work
Advice: None
Pros: It looks great on a resume

Cons: Toxic environment, Come out fast as the experienced or less capable will throw you under the bus. I lasted for 5 years and was told to move around every two years, but with all the diversity hires no room for advancement. New positions were focused on diversity hires and MBAs were overlooked. Look at how many U of Phoenix grads as people came to the realization that they pay across the board regardless of role as long as you have the advance degrees and MS would pay for them. They own all my kids hardware now, as I logged in on their PCs during COVID.
Advice: Stop trying to be all things to all people,  Your defense industry business suffers when security fails in the consumer space.  Stop using AI on everything, it's still Machine Learning.  Don't lead by not doing, so all those managers that could not pass certs don't really understand the business. Lead by example, Don't bring back the Steve Ballmer days, had that one thrown in my face by a customer.  I will not work for another company that allows for golden parachutes to be pulled, which happened, it's public knowledge.

Nice
Elegant

Cons: None yet, I like it here
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance, interesting projects

Cons: work-life balance isn't great, and there's a lot of office politics.
Advice: Positive politics are behaviors that are designed to influence others with the goal of helping both the organization and the person playing the politics. Examples of positive politics include portraying a professional image, publicizing one's accomplishments, volunteering, and complimenting others.
Pros: excellent salaries and benefits, exciting work, and the chance to collaborate with very talented people.

Cons: Anyone can become manager with no managerial skills and can ruin your work life balance, increase mental stress and if you complain it becomes worst for you and you will find yourself alone for no one else to help you.
Advice: please start a process where managers should be accountable
Pros: Company CEO
Company Health Plan

Cons: tuition assistence was terrible. When I say terrible, it was like pulling teeth
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits were great but no stock.

Cons: Horrible work life balance
If you don't get along with your immediate supervisor it will be rough
Some people allowed to contribute very little or strait up refuse work. This means those that do work hard are stuck compensating for those who dont.
Not highest salary, but lots of bonus and stock *Potential*
Having a good relationship with immediate supervisor is critical to your rating, growth opportunities, bonuses, military support etc.
Advice: - Don't promote managers who get poor ratings from their staff. 
- Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. Lots of people want to suggest work but no one wants to own it or do it. 
- Rate people based on the work they do, not on the relationships they have and with whom.
Pros: Medical, Dental, Vision free
Military Benefits (if your supervisor will support you)
Interesting and challenging work
Remote work in some cases.

Cons: Executive business decisions, when they don't yield results, Microsoft does not shy away from reorganizations and likely workforce reductions
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing breadth of technology to work on. Great company culture.

Cons: Lower compensation than competitors. Less developed processes to adapt to changing environments, due to the CE program being fairly new compared to more established programs. This is a constantly improving situation, but it may not be ideal for some folks.
Advice: None

Cons: It has to much office politics
Advice: None
Pros: They provide a good work life balance

Advice: None
Pros: good wlb, low performance pressure

Cons: salary is not that high
Advice: None
Pros: I enjoy the environment and work

Cons: Work life balance will depend on which team you land on. There is no regulation on on-call responsibilities, therefore some teams have really intense on-call rotations.
Advice: Regulate on-call responsibilities to ensure employees are not working long hours and sacrificing their health by lack of sleeping or not having enough time during the day to log off and exercise or recharge.
Pros: Salary, health benefits, good HR department.

Cons: Like other tech companies, there is a constant fear of getting laid off due to numerous internal reorganizations. Your manager and department will change several times, so if you don't like change, you might not like it here. It can take a mental toll.
Advice: More transparency when it comes to incoming team changes. It's stressful and unnerving that we find out when the changes have already taken place.
Pros: Great benefits, open work culture, interesting work

Cons: Sometimes busy, too much to manage,
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible, freedom, free food and drinks

Cons: Scope is limited.
Pay lower than market.
Advice: None
Pros: great work life balance, good manager, great product

Cons: There was a LOT of intentional deletion/misunderstanding/manipulation of others work product. 

Most of middle management only promotes people who are the same ethnicity as them. 

There was a lot of bullying and racist comments in performance reviews. Racist comments were backed up by Staff. They see no problem with calling Black and Brown people “aggressive” and telling them TO THEIR FACE that they are intellectually inferior. 

Most of the people in this group have ONLY worked in Audit. Their interpersonal skills are limited and they lack creativity to go beyond what’s told to them.

You have to receive a performance review after EVERY 4-week audit. I once took time off due to my dog dying (I took 1 day off) and this was included in my performance review as a “do-better”. 

The group has high turnover (go figure) because upper management talks to people like they’re dirt.

Their “diversity” initiatives are all bull; If you’re not outside friends with upper management you will not be promoted or given the opportunity to travel. 

They will encourage working you like a dog for their 4-week audits that are poorly planned for time/scope, even though upper management is so “skilled” at their jobs they can never budget the right amount of time or resources for an audit.

Most of the group is comprised of “ex-consultants” and this again leads to a negative environment. These people tout lives that would make you think they can extend common decency and some sort of empathy, but you’ll be left talking to empty vessels that are insecure if a thought of yours is someone better than theirs. A very insecure and fake group.

On multiple occasions I saw stakeholders curse at and belittle staff. The thought is that if stakeholders treat you bad that is YOUR PROBLEM and you clearly must have done something wrong. Abuse is encouraged in this group.

I was personally told that my degrees and certificates “don’t matter” by my manager at the time. If that was the case, I’m not sure why they hired me. Statements like this were often made in 1:1s with my “manager” who has been at the company 10+ years, yet never managed people. Make it make sense….. How is one promoted to upper management yet has NEVER managed people. That makes NO SENSE whatsoever. The team does not logically assess if a person is truly fit to lead. 

Theres no training requirement on Project Management so there’s people overseeing this who don’t have the right background. If you bring up Project Management practices they will deflect and state some CPA jargon. This is probably why the genius “4-week” audit idea continually fails and why their scope/budgeting/testing/etc. is always a mess.

Asked to work on weekends (especially for financial audits that are poorly planned) and they don’t pay you for the extra time.

This is currently not a 9-5 job (for the people that aren’t close friends with upper management). This is a 7-8 job and the pay does not reflect that. 

Mentioned above, none of the staff has any background credentials in what they’re doing. Most of the staff has a “CPA” and that’s apparently all you need to understand AI, Project Management, Testing, etc. (*Sarcasm*).
Advice: There needs to be a whole reorg.
Internal Audit clearly has racist employees and refuses to face the problem head on. Many people have quit or sued this group overworked, abused and/or publicly said racist statements about them. 

Telling people that they can’t take a lunch break, pick up their pets/kids after work hours and labeling minority employees as “aggressive” or “unprofessional” when they’ve done nothing to you is pure insanity (at the least). There is a lot of money and time wasted due to  upper management acting like complete maniacs behind doors to unsuspecting hires.
Pros: They appear to be sane when interviewing people for the Audit Manager/IT Audit Manager role.

They continually encourage people to leave the group (“transfer internally”) because they know that the Audit Manager/IT Audit Manager role is a disaster all together.

Again, appearances are all this group has going for them. A lot of smiles and small talk but if you show any sign of being a decent person or a true leader, they will try to mentally destroy you.

Cons: Disorganized, NOBODY!, NOBODY even comes close to quota..the MCS org is a total failure. More expensive, less nimble, total joke.
Advice: LOL, management is a joke, they have no idea of whats  going on. Reviews are a joke as you are railroaded to put in certain construct.  MSFT loves that BS term diversity. Why not just hire good people. So many token hires.
Pros: Money is good. Benefits are good.

Pros: Coming from SAP background, it is better to join project management group if you want growth

Advice: None
Pros: Its a really great place to work

Cons: large company, so development happens very slowly.
Advice: None
Pros: benefits and work life balance are wonderful.

Pros: Great company to work with

Cons: Compensation is lower than competitors at the same level.
Advice: Increase the stock refresh every year at every level under L68. This is how you can compete with other high tech firms.
Pros: Compared to other tech firms, life is easy in Microsoft. You don't have work long hours(on average 5 hours a day I guess) but can still get promoted if you are good at what you are doing.

Cons: Lower than average salary stock
Advice: None
Pros: Relaxed culture and good people

Cons: - Uncertainty w/ layoffs across the industry
Advice: None
Pros: - Culture
- Pay
- Benefits (Health, Perks, etc)

Cons: Once the tech role (PFE/CE) was combined with the sales role (CSA) it ruined the tech role. As much lip service as is paid to doing what is right for the customer, at the end of the day it all comes down to sales at all costs. I had a hard time reconciling the ethics of a customer paying to have me on site to provide support, but I am actually rated on how much more I can get them to buy. I doubt customers would be happy to know that is how their paid support is rated.
Advice: Split the tech and sales roles back apart. It is near impossible to maintain the trusted advisor relationship when having to also sell more.
Pros: Job was great in the PFE/CE days, extremely rewarding, good compensation, great org.

Cons: No Cons faced until now
Advice: None
Pros: Company with the best career advance

Pros: Culture, work life balance, doing work i enjoy

Cons: Nothing is negative. I like all.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance. Good pay.

Cons: They still struggle with the same issues as all other large companies in that they report to shareholders and are more concerned with the bottom line than their employees.
Advice: None
Pros: MSFT is a large company so everyone's experience really depends on the team you were hired to. My experience is that I had a supportive manager and colleagues that made my journey at Microsoft a great learning experience. The culture really shifted with Satya becoming CEO so a more inclusive and supportive environment.

Cons: New security org rewards vocal know it all types (but don't actually get work done).
Advice: Change security leadership
Pros: Generally collaborative, work life balance exists, smart people, culture supports diversty

Cons: Long working hours hard to mix work life balance
Advice: None
Pros: Very good environment to grow and learn

Cons: Not that many. Big corporation culture.
Advice: None
Pros: Impact, good culture good experience

Cons: Doing more with less post layoffs feels like you are working 3 jobs for 1 income. Turnover rates have increases and losing great coworkers, and promotions are extremely competitive for mid-Level managers and above. Lots of proving yourself and not being seen as a non-Indian Minority. Lots of folk come in under leveled and have to fight toothand nail to climb to have their pay match the skill level they already came in at. Too much overthrowing and too man meeting for the most minor things.
Advice: Give thorough reviews of documentation when promoting and not just the favoritism group thinking circles for promotions. Create a better evaluation scale and judge to that solely and the skills for the next level role.
Pros: Amazing health, selfcare,401k, and family benefits, great people to work with, and amazing Time off policy. Pay is very solid as well. Great place to learn from some really smart people.

Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Work load is too heavy

Cons: No salary increase over last year, lot's of responsibilities with an average salary for the market. Work/life balance is low, periodic 24/7 calls during 2 weeks (bad for employee's health).
Advice: None
Pros: Great perks/benefits, 100% remote work

Cons: Ever so often I hear that some people newer to Microsoft feel that they have to politic in order to move up the way they want to in the company. Personally, I look at the same thing or situation but have a different view. I look it as you needing to be strategic and intentional as far as it relates to your career trajectory and upward mobility within the company.
Advice: Continue the phenomenal job you're doing. Please keep remote work for all employees as we've shown through our data that we can thrive as a company with productivity, efficiency, and revenue with remote work.
Pros: The culture and people at the company are amazing. Incredible leadership, starting with our CEO, Satya Nadella, along with our C-Suite. Microsoft is a very progressive, innovative, forward thinking company. The company's ERGs like Blacks at Microsoft are phenomenal.

Pros: Constantly innovating, amazing leadership, amazing benefits

Cons: The amount of stress is ridiculous
Advice: None
Pros: Simply the best paying job I've had, but I'd take less pay for less stress.

Cons: insular team, every new idea has to be in the "Microsoft way", tools are ancient (my team did not use git) and frustrating. having to work on Windows tools, too many onerous processes and procedures (you spend very little time coding). They don't understand industry terms and lingo. I was mocked for saying I am taking PTO instead of using OOF (out of office) to describe my time off. People who grow within the organization are preferred to people who are hired from outside when assigning new tasks
Advice: Please open your mind to new ideas when you hire folks from outside.

Advice: None
Pros: great company with lots of benefits, offers a wide range of projects, teams, and groups, providing ample opportunities for career growth

Cons: Company still isn't doing true Product Management and is much more Program Management oriented. Don't get me wrong; I am sure there are few products that do run a Product shop but I had been hard pressed to find them. Also, organization is very siloed and broken up so there are so many dependencies across departments which slows down how fast you can generate impact.
Advice: Lean into how organizations and products are broken up to transition to Product and release fast. Product Managers are complaining about the exp they are able to gain at Microsoft. Increase pay; FB and Google offers way more.
Pros: Company employees are very nice, helpful, down to earth and very family oriented. Opportunities within the company are plenty; I also think though no experienced yet that the troubles you have to get into a type of Product role you don't have experience in, is not faced once you are within. However, you do you have to go through all rounds of interviews like external candidates except 1 or 2 rounds if you are within the same overall organization from the top.

Cons: No free food
Slow career growth

Pros: Slow approval process
Most valuable company

Advice: None
Pros: Perks at Microsoft and the stock

* Depending on the organization you're you might as well be at a different everything from policies, to budgets, hiring, etc can be pretty different.

My boss is amazing - sharp, helpful, empathetic.

Cons: Too many silos. 
Too many managers care more about developing and maintaining their "kingdoms"...than about solving problems.

Advice: There's no such thing as "one microsoft", when every group has their own P&amp;L and cares more about that than the bigger picture...
Pros: Good people
Good working environment

Advice: Be diligent when rewarding your employees, look at all factors versus gross margin/revenue. Obviously, you want to reward those who deserve it, but reward diligently.
Pros: Microsoft has amazing benefits, most people you work with are absolutely outstanding, the customers are great to work with.

a lot of smart people

Cons: Everyone already knows this, the pay is not as good as other tech companies. It's also a relatively slow-moving player when it comes to product development, which can be frustrating.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft actually sells its products, which makes it resilient to market changes in, for example, the advertisement industry, and means its incentive is to empower and watch its customers succeed. This makes a huge difference when you're building products.

Cons: The rate of progression can be pretty slow and prescribed. It's also heavily dependent on the team and organization that you're working in.
Advice: None
Pros: Great leadership, lots of flexibility in your work style, great culture, smart and friendly colleagues. Open structure, and it's easy to network, meet people from all backgrounds and levels and pick their brains.

Advice: None
Pros: Love the energy and talent of the people working on the product i’m designing for. I can’t speak for the rest of microsoft but i definitely don’t feel like it’s a “retirement home for tech bros”. The work is fast paced, the energy is high and i feel respected as a designer here, I am thankful for the eng and PMs i work with on my feature for that. Also i feel like leadership really care and want me to take breaks for a better work life balance.

Cons: As with other large corporations there's a lot of bureaucracy and rigid process. Hard for me to comment much further due to my short stint and unique situation with the corporate transition as noted above. They also were going to have us give up our MacBooks, which is hardly a surprise given that it's Microsoft, but that was very unpopular with most of the engineers coming into the organization.
Advice: None
Pros: I only worked at Microsoft for about 8 months after my company was acquired by them, but had a positive experience overall. A lot of nice benefits, good pay, and opportunities if you're able to find the right role for yourself.

My position was eventually eliminated and I was laid off, but was given 3 months of severance pay and felt that Microsoft handled the process with dignity. Obviously nobody wants to get that call, but it ended up being a good catalyst for my career and having the 3 months of full salary/benefits to take a break and job search was really nice.

Cons: gets hectic sometimes and can be stressful

Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is excellent

Cons: work life balance and bonus structure
Advice: None
Pros: not good parking and the technology is old

Cons: Because of it's size, Microsoft is massively process-heavy and lacks both agility and high performing teams. I've been unimpressed with the caliber of talent here, especially given the reputation. It's a company you could stay at your entire career, but if you're super highly motivated and don't like to "accept" inefficiencies then you'll quickly become frustrated.
Advice: Put more pressure on your teams to be change agents, to fix the broken or ineffective processes, and continue to elevate the high performers.
Pros: Microsoft has all the pros of a massive tech company - great benefits offerings, good culture, lots of fun colleagues, and good work-life balance. Employees are enjoying great financial results right now and it makes it easy to stay.

Large Company Environment: Working in a large company means that employees might feel like a small part of a vast machine. It can be challenging to stand out or make a significant impact individually.
Change and Uncertainty: The technology industry is fast-paced and subject to constant change. Microsoft employees must be adaptable and comfortable with uncertainty as business strategies and technologies evolve.
Advice: None
Pros: nnovation and Learning: Microsoft is at the forefront of technology, offering employees the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects. It fosters an environment of continuous learning and development, encouraging employees to explore new technologies and improve their skills.
Diverse and Inclusive Culture: The company values diversity and inclusion, striving to create a welcoming environment for employees from various backgrounds. Microsoft works on fostering a culture where everyone feels valued and included.
Benefits and Compensation: Microsoft is known for offering competitive salaries and benefits, including health insurance, retirement plans, and generous leave policies. Additionally, employees may receive bonuses, stock options, and other financial incentives.
Work-Life Balance: Despite being a large corporation, Microsoft places a significant emphasis on work-life balance. Flexible working hours and the possibility of remote work are policies that support employees in managing their professional and personal lives.

Cons: - Very political. Many managers are people who are the loudest and not the most knowledgable or capable.
- Experience varies by teams. Some teams are very toxic.
- Finger pointing and back stabbing culture
- Not as glamorous as it seems. 80% of the work gets accomplished by 20% of the people.
Advice: - Focus on hiring people that actually want to do work and build products, not people that want to rest and vest. These people tend to block and be intimidated by people that actually want to get work done.
- Be cautious that many managers are leftover from Steve Balmer's time and still have that mindset, or some team's still have that mindset. Be cautious that these people are not blocking the progress of others.
Pros: - Compensation Benefits (not the best in the industry though)
- Perks
- Health Insurance is very good

Cons: low salary compared to other tech companies
Advice: None
Pros: work life balance
good learning curve

Cons: After the layoffs, the work culture in general got worse. People are working longer hours, even at night, to get a good performance review. Much more pressure to perform and deliver under tight deadlines. Due to past layoffs, everyone had to take on more responsibilities for under-staffed projects.

PS: of course, this experience differs from team to team. Some orgs within MSTF still have great work-life balance. Some other orgs got it worse.

Cons: Microsoft's investment in people and morale has declined over the years. Moral budgets for things like Christmas parties were steadily reduced both pre and post covid.

These are just two examples of the types of changes that have occurred over the last 8 years.
Advice: Remember that Microsoft is more than data centers.

Cons: Politics
Corruption
DEI gone to the furthest extremes
Severe prejudice
Stagnant salaries
Low overall compensation
Horrible senior leadership
Violations of State and Federal laws hidden by Partners and VPs to protect themselves
Leadership politics against their own employees (especially at review time) to increase the raise and bonus pot for themselves
Merit increases and bonuses on a curve even though they say they aren't
Long work hours (20hr days) with no appreciation
Under/low experience staffing models
Advice: Look at all leadership below Satya. 90% of them are playing politics for themselves and care nothing for their people.
Discrimination goes both ways...when you have female Presidents that say the company has to fire all straight, old, white men...and then does so, that's not only immoral, it's also illegal.
Your Partners, CVPs, VPs, and Presidents are hiding violations of regulation, lying to auditors, forcing their personnel to hide compliance and security failures.
Customers are barely 2nd from last to your CVPs, VPs, and most Partners...but only because employees are last.
Stop promoting leadership based on their ability to cut opex, they're successful only because they're cutting what is necessary.
If a scorecard is green you're being lied to, but the lie is either from or directed by your CVPs, VPs, and Partners.
Your Presidents are leading through fear and it cascades and magnifies as you go down.
Your financial controls are terrible, but everyone is lying to you to keep you happy.
A high attrition rate should be grounds to fire a President, VP, CVP, or Partner. Likely it should be done in that order.
Every promotion you made to appease the DEI world is a failure...a female President in the company who was promoted to the position due to an article critical of a lack of female senior leaders is most likely not qualified at all.
When you have team building events where you tell everyone who looks Caucasian that they aren't allowed to speak (even if they're light skinned Spanish, mixed race, etc...) you build resentment, not teams.
Female leadership abusing and sexually harassing male personnel is rampant but the company response in the event of a complaint is to fire the male.
95% of your major security breaches are due to Senior Leadership hiding failures and threatening their personnel that they'll be fired or zero'd on review if they speak up.
Your SOX audits are a complete failure, you haven't funded the implementation of real controls but punish people like they are chattle if there's a finding.
You finance organization compliance personnel (not the ops teams, not the devs, not the devil's folks, not the security people, not the compliance people in the actual engineering teams) are the problem.
DEI should mean you have diverse views, what you have created is an environment where any view not approved of by the diversity police is unacceptable, that's bad for everyone including your customers.
Everyone knows that HRs job is to protect the company and everyone has accepted that, however, your HR organization is the biggest violator of HR rules in the company. Make them lead by example.
Don't force teams to use a new Azure offering if the offering is broken...make the team fix it first, then feel free to force everyone else to use it.
Your good personnel who know how everything works are burned out. When they tell you they need skilled personnel to support the workload and provide a well functioning, stable, resilient, secure, and compliant offering, listen.
Pros: Smart people although that is getting less and less

Cons: If you're allergic to 70+ hour work weeks, don't come to Microsoft. GM's and CVP's will work you into the ground until you turn to dust and then just hire your replacement.
Advice: The broader IC team shared with me that they don't feel comfortable sharing honest feedback during internal survey time, for fear of retaliation. Take this seriously and identify GM's and senior leaders that are hurting the positive culture you say you want to build. All the "lip service" and heart emojis used in communications mean nothing. "Walk the talk!"
Pros: Good team, most want to help when they can. Great benefits and compensation which is required when mental health suffers due to 7 day work week, laughable "time off," and you need to leave for your own sanity.

Bureaucrats are rewarded for everything but the work required for their role.
Layoffs are always a worry.
Advice: Get rid of all of the excess management.

Workplace benefits
Best in class products

Cons: The executive assistants and admins make barely anything compared to everyone else. One bonus for an FTE is more than twice what an EA makes in a year. I matched the executive hours, and my pay was barely at a living wage for Seattle. 
On-call non-stop doesn't equal any promotions or bonuses for admins or EAs.
Advice: Give raises to the EAs, they're working non-stop. 
Listen to the admins and the EAs. They might actually know how to work a PowerPoint or Excel, unlike all the PMs you've hired for 150k.

Advice: Don't lie about how performance reviews take place and pretend that stack ranking doesn't exist. It's cruel and lacks integrity.
Pros: High pay, prestige, and scope of influence.

Cons: As a Consultant, you had a billable hours target that you were expected to hit, but don't expect much support from management if the work dries up.

Advice: None
Pros: Health care benefits are excellent

Cons: no downsides in this co.
Advice: None
Pros: very good culture in the co.

Cons: Very little authority to execute projects because of the influence-based culture. Consensus has to be reached before anything can get done, and then every step of the way there are people who dissent, question, push back, etc. It is also extremely challenging to switch roles right now, especially if working for a manager with whom you don't work well.

This doesn't speak for MSFT as a whole, but people who stay at a place longer tend to have set preferences, don't want things to change too much, can be hostile towards people who are new and different in their approach.
