Cons: Work life balance, international travel, tight deadlines, management pressure
Advice: None
Pros: Surrounded by incredibly intelligent people trying to solve complex problems on tight deadlines. Everyone is efficient, and operationally minded, with a can-do mindset.

Cons: High-Stress Environment: The fast-paced and demanding nature of work at Apple can lead to high stress and long hours, potentially impacting work-life balance.

Intense Competition: The high level of competition among employees can create a pressure-filled atmosphere, where maintaining high performance is crucial to success and job security.

Limited Flexibility: While Apple offers some flexibility, the nature of the work, especially in roles related to product development and launches, can require being physically present at the office, limiting remote work opportunities.

Privacy and Secrecy: Due to the confidential nature of Apple’s projects, there is often a culture of secrecy, which can limit open communication and sharing of information within the company.

Bureaucracy: As a large corporation, Apple has a significant amount of bureaucracy and red tape, which can slow down decision-making processes and implementation of new ideas.
Advice: None
Pros: Innovative Environment: Apple is known for its culture of innovation, constantly working on cutting-edge technology and products, which can be highly motivating and intellectually stimulating for employees.

Competitive Compensation and Benefits: Apple offers attractive salaries, bonuses, and comprehensive benefits packages, including health insurance, retirement plans, and stock options.

Career Growth Opportunities: Apple provides numerous opportunities for career advancement and professional development through various training programs, mentorship, and internal job postings.

Global Impact: Working at Apple means contributing to products and services that are used by millions of people worldwide, giving a sense of pride and accomplishment.

Collaborative Work Culture: Apple fosters a collaborative work environment where employees often work in cross-functional teams, encouraging diverse perspectives and teamwork.

Cons: Work life balance isn’t real
Internal Interview process is terrible
No accountability for management
Non commission-commission based role where you’re told to push AppleCare+ on customer and to get them to “yes” even when they say no.
There are metrics you need to reach and if not you get pulled to the side about why you didn’t reach them.
But then told you’re not a commission based business.
The way of Apple and its “fun” “inviting” culture is gone. The store redesigns create a more modern look but the engagement was and has always been with people doing live demos and fun experiences with their customers. Not trying to upsell and get them to purchase everything in the store. The “Well we’re a for profit business” response is a pathetic one. Apple has ALWAYS been a for profit company and even from 2014 up till before Covid employees truly cared about the customer experience and making a difference in every customer interaction. But not it’s about making sure you get your metrics before you get talked to. 
I’ve had multiple discussions with employees from other stores and it’s the same problem everywhere. People joined Apple because of the image of “make a difference” but when you work there for a couple of years you see through their political environment and really see it for what it is. And that’s a Fancy Best Buy that sells only Apple products.
Advice: Challenge yourself to do something different. Stop sticking to the usual day to day. Actually support your team but helping them when they’re drowning rather than hiding in your iPad.
Pros: Good Benefits
Generally good coworkers
Pay is okay

Cons: 1. Inconsistent messaging - management rarely give straight answers, you may get a totally different (and possibly inaccurate) answer from different managers
2. Tools fail constantly. Software programs crash, web based tools are slow and crash, outdated UIs, not inclusive of neurodiversity or disabilities, 
3. Everything is based on CST so be prepared to work either ridiculously early or ridiculously late to meet company needs.
4. Employee enrichment is a joke (for example: I got a penny sized pin in the mail to thank me for all my hard work).
5. Training, continuing education, procedural documents, and the like are all fashioned in a piece-meal, haphazard, and idiotic fashion. Tribal knowledge rules supreme but you are expected to perform without fault or flaw.
Advice: I challenge management to put themselves on the front lines in an unfamiliar job role armed only with the "training" and "knowledge base" provided to their employees. Then maybe they will understand
Pros: Insurance and stock benefits are great. I've made some good friends.

Cons: Very poor work-life balance. Large emphasis placed on payroll hours, tight-fisted hiring practices, and lax leave of absence policy leaves critical roles in the stores un-staffed for months or even more than a year. Management culture is to tighten the belt and shoulder the extra work with, but no additional compensation provided. Work hours required to complete tasks and drive successful business compete with direction to run the sales floor and drive day-of profits, creating short-sighted, month-to-month goals and results that lack long-term strategy to sustain it. Corporate management is disconnected and places emphasis on results and consequences at the expense of support and inspiration. Hours are better abroad, stores are prevented from hiring to fill vacant spots requiring much more work from employees, compensation is mediocre when compared to profits and cost-of-living increases, and store-level upper management and corporate management are heavily focused on short-term profits at the expense of all else.
Advice: Apple has the potential to create a positive impact on the employees lives just as much as customers around the globe. In over a decade at this company, I've heard many leaders focused on putting Apple's resources and brand behind the employees to develop them and provide opportunities. In the last two years, Apple's focus has shifted toward a competitive, bottom-line focus that loses the fire and passion of many employees. Don't let Apple become just another trash retailer. 
Pros: Strong brand, access to philanthropy, quality products. Great tools provided internally to get daily work done, such as scheduling, KPI monitoring, customer flow and inventory management, etc. Semi-annual feedback surveys feel important at individual store-level, if not company-level.

Cons: I cannot think of any
Advice: None
Pros: Great mentorship and great office

Cons: Workers are no longer valued. Those most knowledgable about Apple products, policies, and the culture of Apple, people who have been with the company 5, 10 even 20 years... are being quiet-cut, or cut altogether.... by the hundreds. You are managed almost entirely through cold automated systems, and management is really only there to help interpret. 

So called "opportunities" come in the form of temporary positions only, usually in a role that would be higher paying, but as a temp you will retain your pay rate, despite performing more advanced tasks. When they have gotten their use of you, you are shipped back to over-worked positions not desired by those who have connections you don't have. 

You'll be told that your reviews, your participation in projects and "voluntary" tasks will propel you forward, however even years of consistently exceeding expectations, accolades and involvement will never get you past the favoritism, nepotism, and cronyism.

Management has a complete disconnect, with those whom they manage. They essentially act as messengers at some-point in a grape-vine between investors, and staff. They will deliver a message, if you have questions, concerns, or disagreement, you will get the standard corporate speak "We hear you, we understand and we'll be sure to send your concerns up", but you will never hear back, concerns will never be addressed, you will just get fed those same corporate speaking lines. 

Workers have little to no input (this was not always the case, even at a company as large as Apple), if you call out any type of issue, you'll be gaslit and told the issue is really you.
Advice: Listen to workers.
Pros: You will be working alongside talented, friendly, skilled individuals. You'll notice this immediately, even though management does not.

Cons: Work-life Balance
Scheduling
Hours
Growth
Advice: Focus on individual growth and development
Pros: Benefits &amp; Stocks
Culture 
Discounts

Cons: While it is chill at times, 90% of the time is spent having customers treat you like garbage for something that they did. All while trying to reassure them and act like them talking bad about you isn't a problem. Then you have managers expecting you to hit a certain unreasonable expectation that only a select staff members an achieve due to them upselling on everything that a customer actually doesn't need. They also tell you that you are a family and important to the company while paying you only 20 dollars an hour.
Advice: None
Pros: Team is nice, and job is chill at times.

Cons: Can become repetitive and cause burnout.
Advice: None
Pros: You’re able to work remotely. Perfect for people who enjoy troubleshooting and issue investigation.

Cons: Micro managing, unrealistic expectations, late hours
Advice: None
Pros: Working from home. Non phone

Cons: Is&amp;T is a hit or miss
Advice: None
Pros: Nice people,
chill work environment,

Cons: Managers care about numbers, it’s almost impossible to transfer to a different location. You will get stuck in this store.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits (401k, discounted stocks, health insurance and great pay for retail)

Cons: The requirement for working retail hours
Advice: None
Pros: Apple provides opportunity for growth, and it is a great place to build community through relationships.

Cons: At times, it is within your scope of work to deliver bad news, and offer the available solutions. Being able to calmly communicate with all types of people and patience levels will go a long way.
Advice: None
Pros: You will get the chance to work with some of the most innovative groups of people, and learn all about what it means to work as part of an effective team.

Cons: Overworked in the retail setting
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, company has good systems to look out for employee rights

Cons: Staffing is only sufficient during the winter holidays. There is more focus on numbers and productivity then experience for customers and employees. I don't like that I have to "ask" for time off to see my family living in another state.
Advice: put the breaks on the numbers and focus on the behavior.  The team members at the frontline talking to customers struggle with providing a great experience if you're constantly asking them to look at the metrics.
Pros: Pay is good for retail. Benefits are great

Cons: Culture is sometimes toxic
Decisions are made at high level and engineers are forced to follow even if they disagree
Advice: None
Pros: High salary
Job security
Great name on resume
People are nice and friendly

Cons: nothing bad to say about them.
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing people, everyone is friendly, they really care about you

Cons: No cons apple is great. Very nice company
Advice: None
Pros: nice company very nice company very nice company

Cons: Poor management, busy store, not much room for improvement
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and great culture, great pay.

Cons: No clear lines between work and life. You will get texts, calls, emails at the most inappropriate hours; even on weekends. It's not strange - it's part of the culture, from the top down. This is all in the name of "doing your best work" while at the company. Since 2020 hiring has largely reduced and the volume of work has only increased. You do the math. Work has become the biggest point of stress, anxiety and decline of my mental health. I have dependents so careful with my decision to leave, but there's no doubt that day will be the light at the end of the tunnel.
Advice: Protect your people for longevity; find and force cultural shifts in work/life balance. Yes, they are lucky to be at the company, but the company is equally lucky to have brilliant minds under its roof.
Pros: Learning potential 
Resume boost
Camaraderie

Cons: Strict at work policy for hybrid
Advice: None
Pros: Compensation and benefits, some orgs are good

Cons: Can be very competitive if you are trying to advance in the company.
Advice: None
Pros: Company culture; stock options; opportunities for advancement

Cons: Honestly, one of the better experiences of my career so far.
Advice: None
Pros: Coworkers were incredibly intelligent, generous, and kind. Meetings and workflow was well structured and the team was really good at staying up to date and implementing the latest technologies.

Cons: Short breaks, time off is often denied, if you ask too many questions you get pulled aside and called stupid, if you talk to HR about a manager and a serious issue, they will fire you instead of actually helping. Despite all the lies of open communication and “we’re here to support you”
Advice: Racist hiring.  They all have different agendas.  They protect themselves before protecting employees.  And will make sure you know that when you’re out of work and taking care of things in your own life such as domestic violence, I got responded with “do you really have to do this right now? You’re just hurting us when you’re gone” sorry court and abuse is an inconvenience to you.   Incompetent management and disgusting behaviors.   They micro manage and spy on everything.   They make a document with PARAGRAPHS of everything you’ve done they don’t approve of.    If you don’t help people fast enough, you get talked to.   It’s not about customers anymore. It’s all about meetings and money.   It’s not the culture I once loved.   I hate it.   Go back to the old ways.   
Pros: No pros. No work life balance. Rude. And all about their own little groups.

Cons: - Insane work hours and work culture. Everyone is putting in 70hr weeks consistently, so you better grind it out just to keep pace. 
- Some politics of course, the people that have been here for 10+ years make it very hard for any newer person to grow. Career growth is quite slow.
Advice: - Management can be condescending to newer/younger employees. Oh please, get off your high horse. They might be better than me in this one product ecosystem that they know in and out, doesnt make them a better Electrical Engineer than me. Be compassionate and let the youngsters learn.
Pros: Get to work on the internal hardware of an iPhone. What is the first thing someone touches in the morning? For hundreds of millions of people, that’s an iPhone. So, it is pretty rewarding to have contributed to that! 
Learnt loads and loads of technical details and get to work with some of the smartest people in the world

Cons: the more the company brings in outside "managers" the more the culture will change, talking to a manager who has no clue about the products on the floor, leaves such a defeatist feeling
Advice: make sure your managers, know MORE than the employees on the floor. The managers who went up the ranks from specialist to expert to pro to lead to manager, have a completely different outlook than someone who worked at Forever 21 or Starbucks.
Pros: Love the products, loved the culture, loved the possibilities

Cons: Demanding job that requires initial time commitment.
Advice: Continue supporting employees through creating value in the time spent in the office.
Pros: Employee outreach is crucial. Apple goes above and beyond to make sure employees are happy. Happy employees produce much better results.

Cons: Work-life balance, need to be good at time and stress management,
It's a great role for many, for others who may be interested in other things it could be a stepping stone to other roles, for instance if someone says out loud they're more interested in security, marketing, or software engineering you can use this role for tuition assistance don't feel discouraged just being what seems to be an entry-level role- even though upward mobility can be limited based on your performance and there are only so many promotions available in this department, it's a normal corporate hierarchical environment.
Only 5% raise with Apple's normal path after 1 year, if you are in-house you have a little more resources, if you're a contractor or what is referred to as "AHA" an at-home advisors you can't expect to excel by doing the same things over again and may need to seek expanding your career elsewhere if you are not fulfilled, this seemed to lead to lower morale but it's up to the employee to make an effort too and network with colleagues in other departments, or upskill yourself and learn instead of being negative.
They're building a great team, but certain workflows are getting outdated, they need to upgrade with the times, and don't call your employees tax quotas, many employees have ideas they are ready to implement to keep Apple relevant and cutting-edge, identify hard-working and high-aptitude top performers, let them contribute and grow. This is obviously less of an impact until you are promoted to a new role because of sheer numbers in such a large company. This can be difficult to focus and learn when even at your new campus a large percentage of employees are struggling to commute to work and pay rent in the RTP area at a salary of less than 50k, just reading 100s of facebook comments about the new campus you can see there is actually a disparity between living costs and how much they're paying many employees- you'll need to live with family on this one depending on your lifestyle, being a single earner or trying to start a family with higher rents in the area will be difficult to cut it on this wage alone. It's difficult to think some employees paid 200k+ may do less than 2 hours of work a day while others paid 1/4th or less taking a brunt of bad processes are struggling even though they want to and can contribute. However, everyone is responsible for their own paths and taking the steps in their own life to learn and adapt, if no one puts forth an effort nothing gets done, there were lots of experienced and impressive people there who were encouraging. The iPhone may not float off the table yet, but startups are working on new projects that are like science-fiction already and gaining high market share. Just being a part of Apple, you can use your off-time and learning resources to continue to excel.
Advice: You were the top market cap company, pay to retain talent.
Fix some systemic issues that have been lingering around for years, a few changes can immediately stifle the top criticisms, no matter how many people you have to coordinate with to accomplish, stepping on people's toes and being a little less politically correct is sometimes okay if it lights a fire under people to do their best work, stay on top of new developments and excel, don't be afraid to demand excellence and continue to set higher standards of performance.  Provide more resources and encourage career development for people eager to contribute more, such as support for tuition benefits provided or encouraging and making it easy to use learning stipends (I'd say I confirmed maybe only 10% of my coworkers may had been utilizing the tuition benefits).  There is great research and work being done at Apple, many startups and new companies still look up to the teams at Apple and products they ship, but it will continue to take a lot of work to remain at the top as the market may pick new winners in certain key sectors, that will always be poaching and recruiting top talent away from Apple unless they can keep innovating and stay nimble.  I would still enjoy working there again in the future as a SWE or in the hardware engineering departments, but I would only accept a high TC- one because I want to truly earn it and provide value to the company's future successes, and two I want to raise a large family very comfortably and not struggle in today's economy which is increasingly more difficult on one revenue stream.
Pros: supportive environment
training
growth potential
If you like Apple and apply yourself you can learn a lot, but there will be lots of intangible things you must recognize and pursue to excel

Cons: - Micromanagement: Issues with middle management and a tendency towards micromanagement can be challenging.
- Internal Competition: Intense competition and siloed departments can hinder collaboration.
- Limited Internal Movement: Career development opportunities exist, but internal movement is limited.
Advice: While middle management and micromanagement were factors in my decision to leave, I understand the challenges that come with managing a large organization like Apple. However, it's crucial not to stifle the potential of employees who show promise. Leaving Apple was difficult because of the unparalleled innovation and the high standards set. It's challenging to find another workplace that matches this level of excellence. While management was a reason for my departure, it's essential to recognize and nurture employees who have the potential to shine. Don't block their growth; instead, support them to achieve greatness within the company.
Pros: - Benefits: Apple offers an outstanding benefits package and healthcare benefits.

- Access to Cutting-Edge Projects: I had the opportunity to work on groundbreaking, often secretive projects that reflects the infamous culture. 

- Competitive Compensation: Salaries at Apple are highly competitive, stock options for performance/APRs.

- Supportive and Dynamic Colleagues: The environment is filled with some of the most talented and supportive individuals you could hope to work with, enhancing the overall work experience.

- Adaptable Work Arrangements: Initially hired to work remotely, I appreciated Apple’s flexibility. However, the transition to a hybrid model required a relocation to Austin to continue with my role

- Culture of Excellence: Apple maintains a high-performance culture that continually promotes personal and professional improvement. 

I had a great time working at Apple. While the job often required long hours and a lot of effort, it was incredibly rewarding and has been the best thing for my career. The experience and skills I gained there look fantastic on a resume and have opened up numerous opportunities for me.

Cons: A lot of work, very fast paced. College does not train you for this. You either have it or you don’t have it.
Advice: None
Pros: A lot of collaborations. Ownership of lifecycle. Open door policy. Great people. Benefits.

Cons: This role can vary depending on your location. Duties and tasks will be at the discretion of your manager.
Advice: None
Pros: Being able to be in a pro role

Cons: Not a lot of upward movement and growth
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and pay. There is potential to get more hours

Cons: Hard to see your impact at such a large company.
Advice: None
Pros: Smart, motivated colleagues. Stable company.

Cons: Expecting to be all about the job all the time, demanding, little work life balance, fats-paced and often chaotic
Advice: None
Pros: Strong sense of community, empowering knowledge, friendly culture

Cons: *They recently bumped the admins from a specialist level role to a pro level role, giving them at least around $30/hr. Admins do a similar role to ops specialist, and I’ve actually been training and providing continual feedback to our new admins over the last 2-3 months. This feels like a slap to the face because we handle EVERYTHING for the store, from making sure that work orders are taken care of/scheduled, budget management, inventory management, inbound customer calls, tech support for the in-store-use devices including iPads, Isaacs (iPhone+payment sled), Macs, printers, and now Apple Vision Pros. So, thanks Apple.
Advice: Change the role of operations. You already treat ops like like management anyways. “Go ask ops.” YOU are the manager. If you want us to make more decisions, change our role. 
1. Operations Coordinator (can flip with 2)
2. Operations Expert (can flip with 1)
3. Operations Lead
Too easy. I already do significantly more than PZ Specialists and Tech Specialists anyways.
Pros: Fantastic pay(ish)*, Culture, Skills, Benefits, Coursera

Cons: Management depending on the store. Don’t gain commission for your metrics, you gain a small raise for it every year plus some stocks that you only see the full amount after staying for 3+ years.
Advice: Listen to their employees on how to be coached. Don’t micro-manage, let the employee grow without your input constantly. 
Pros: Flexible schedule, great job while working for college, opportunities to network/go to California, 25% off discount. Meeting amazing people.

Cons: Terrible work life balance. Go into a black hole
Advice: None
Pros: Great perks at this company if you like apple products

Cons: - Drains your mental wellbeing depending on the customers you receive
Advice: Be more understanding towards your college student employees
Pros: - Flexible Schedule
- Pay is great for a college student
- Company benefits
- Easy workload

Cons: Same ole same ole has become the norm. Innovation in how we operate is dead.
Advice: Time to freshen up the stores, they are now basically service centers, no more reason to come here to explore and experience
Pros: Great place to work with a great culture

Cons: Difficult to obtain a position there.
Advice: None
Pros: Truly not your typical corporate mentality. They value their people and it shows in everything that they do. The amazing benefits they offer their employees to enhance their lives and support them is truly impressive.

Cons: There can be the tendency to get lost in the “culture” and forget that this is a business first. I’ve noticed that this can cause some teammates to become more demanding of “rights” and benefits. The culture of Apple is fun, just remember to keep one foot on the ground when drinking the kool-aid and don’t get carried away by the politics of it all.
Advice: Management does a great job, at least our current leadership team is supportive and kind! There’s always ways to improve but you can’t expect perfection from imperfect people.
Pros: The pay is significantly better compared to other entry level retail jobs in the state. The benefits are good and leadership is interested in helping you develop your skills and talents

Cons: As a seasonal hire, awkward hours
Advice: None
Pros: Great Environment
Great Benefits
Great Co Workers

Cons: Your managers are above untouchable. You might be lucky and have a supervisor who doesn’t micromanage and tell you to have lunch away from your desk ( yes I was shocked too) . However, if you get one who was never trained in leadership, your time will be wasted mitigating the harassment. Your productivity and work ethic isn’t the priority. It is a hotbed of gossip and backstabbing.
Advice: None
Pros: Health insurance and benefits along with short and long term disability

Cons: a lot of pression and work
Advice: None
Pros: amazing group of talented people

Cons: -Company is now so metrics driven that some job roles have no downtime, none. 
-Store gets so busy that there is not enough time to: wait in line to go to the restroom; provide well thought out feedback; provide the level of customer service that Apple WAS known for; and no ability to create camaraderie. 
-Some stores have no room for inventory/shipments and/or gets so busy that people are crowding and getting into other’s personal space. 
-Creates massive burnout; Thus, many employees take disability leaves of absence for mental health. Not enough sick nor vacation time to create work / life balance. 
-The retail side wants your 24 hour / seven days a week availability; Mandatory work on Friday-Sunday; and makes it difficult for those working 20 or less to get a second gig. AKA they “own you”.
Advice: I don’t know where to start…
-Address the issues brought up in the “store PULSE surveys”. 
-Be authentically concerned about your employees and course correct. 
-Stop “Greedflation”.
Pros: -Great benefits (for those that are not debt burdened or have additional sources to income) so that one can actually use the benefits. (Access does not equal use.)
-Fair pay for a “Retail Job”.
-Very casual work attire. (Yoga pants, mini skirts, sandals/Crocs, shorts, etc.) 
-Tops provided.

Cons: Nothing. Maybe no free food?
Advice: None
Pros: Everything great here. Glassdoor, I have shared salary, there is no point force me to share a review here

Cons: little pay for tasks at hand
Advice: None
Pros: Great job for sales people

Cons: No real direction in my part of the business. Leadership is lacking. Seems impossible to move from retail into corporate.
Advice: None
Pros: Apple cares deeply about their employees.

Cons: Top down management, work life balance not great. Diversity is not a thing
Advice: Put more effort in diversity
Pros: good pay, good coworkers, prestige

Cons: Hard to switch because its a big company and things take time.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, nice work life balance, great work community

Cons: Politics and attitudes. People with big chips on their shoulders
Advice: None
Pros: Good resources, lots of travel, capable teammates

Cons: Extremely micro managed. It took me leaving after 10 years to realize how much horrible it was there. They like to pretend like everything is ok all the time even though its not. I felt like I was brainwashed
Advice: listen to your employee's concerns and acknowledge them. 
Pros: good benefits and discounts on proucts

Cons: Every day I wake up in a dark chasm of loneliness
Advice: Get more cool merch!
Pros: The ability to tell others that you work at apple.

Cons: Very limited growth opportunities in the long term.
Advice: None
Pros: Good compensation for mechanical engineers in the area

Cons: none v none none none none none none v
Advice: none none none none none vnone
Pros: great place to work great place to work great place to work great place to work great place to work

Cons: Visibility across teams can be opaque. This makes multi-functional collaboration across teams hectic, and oftentimes very stressful considering the ambitious schedules we race against.
No free snacks as some other tech companies offer.
Advice: None
Pros: Work on exciting features, surrounded by passionate and nice people. Compensation is quite nice. 
*Your experience may vary depending on the team you join.

Cons: The current state of the company is concerning as it looks to be simply for the money these days. Granted I was in the retail side of apple and we all know how the retail industry is. Yet, the amount of micromanagement that has been present and lack of incentive to truly increase employee moral is terrible. I have seen strong workers that have truly given their all breakdown which has lead to people quitting, taking leaves, or being let go because performance was lacking. 

Management treats all stores the same and it's something that you can't do because of locations and store size. Managers also like to gossip like high schoolers and do not possess the skill to perform basic transactions when staff is low.
Advice: Take the time to listen to what your teams are saying. Properly evaluate the metrics that you want to see and truly think about how they can realistically obtained. Learn how to perform some (not all) functions of the various roles so that you can truly lead via example.
Pros: When it comes to the people and the benefits Apple is bay far the best. I have had the privilege to call a lot of coworkers friends and evens some managers as well. One of the best retail gigs I have ever had.

Cons: I have no cons for this employer
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay great team great leadership

Cons: This job is emotionally and physically exhausting. The goal is to see more customers always even when the team is short staffed. Most behind the scenes areas are shorted support but asked to do more. There used to be better staffing but that version of this company has deteriorated.

Over focused on metrics and ways to make numbers but not the right behaviors.
Good employees are rewarded with more work, managers friends receive promotion, despite lack of achievements.
Advice: Get in the trenches with your team to better understand their pain points and make improvements that improve your teams day to day.
Pros: The pay and benefits are amazing especially for anyone coming from a retail background.

Cons: Way too political, both internally and externally
Advice: Accountability is key 
Pros: Great benefits and wonderful people

Cons: The pay is extremely low. The role is categorized as a retail position even though the work is directly with corporate with no direct tie to sales.
Advice: None
Pros: Great team, great company ethos, and deeply impactful work.

Cons: None, it was a nice company and interview
Advice: None
Pros: Good experience as intern, would return

Cons: They cracked down on unionization efforts as hard as they could, skirting the law as much as they could
Advice: None
Pros: The pay is good and the management is organized

Cons: Retail - mentally exhausting; not given enough headcount for staffing; they want us to support heritage months, holiday, etc but no money given to do so, it has to come out of our personal pockets; they claim work/life balance but unless your in leadership it doesn’t work that way; there is too much focus on titles when applying for other positions, great people get overlooked.
Advice: Those making decisions need to actually work in the retail environment and understand the needs before cutting staff and creating budgets. The bias that surrounds the hiring processes needs to be evaluated in both corporate and retail settings.
Pros: Benefits, discounts, co-workers, pay, and EAP

Cons: They have a subtle way of firing people called a Documented Coaching where if you don’t meet their ridiculous sales quotas, then you can get fired for not meeting expectations. 
The merit increases are a joke. It is very unlikely that you will ever receive an Exceeded Expectation rating consistently for the entire year bc not only does that mean you met the company sales goals for every quarter, that also means you had the time to show others how to do it and also their numbers have to be consistently good and you have to track it via emails with your manager CC’d so they have a paper trail.
Advice: Stop cherry picking your customers, we all see it and know you do it bc there’s not way you could take 10 or 20 phones in a row and they all have AppleCare along with all the other metrics you weigh us by.
Pros: Co-pay for in-network clinics and specialists are pretty reasonable. 
Great place to network with some pretty inspiring people

Cons: HR in retail group was deaf to legitimate employee issues, like managers blocking employee transfers. Their attitude was pretty much “shut up or you’ll make trouble for yourself”. It took years of attrition and employees launching ER cases for egregiously bad leaders to be finally be looked at and removed. You’d expect better oversight from a company of Apple’s stature, but I guess not. There seems to be a real reluctance to believe an Apple leader can actually be terrible, no matter how many people complain and what evidence is presented.
Advice: Stop putting glib talkers, mediocre sycophants and Dunning-Kruger types in leadership roles when they have *no meaningful  experience* in the field. These sorts can’t gauge the work accurately, so they can’t hire or gauge skill accurately, or create processes that make sense. The internal comms team was rife with insecure managers, because every one of them was outpaced by their own skilled team members and everyone, including business partners, knew it. And since these essentially useless managers weren’t going to be promoted, they would suppress the team members who had promotion potential. It was pathetic. They all get churned out eventually, after years of incompetence, but why does it take Apple so long to do so. Fix your process and identify the problem leaders before they run the team to the ground.
Pros: The work. You do a lot of complicated stuff with a great amount of autonomy. It’s clear what your priorities should be, so while you work a lot of atypical hours, you know what to focus on at any given moment and there is little micro managing

Cons: Politics, politics, politics! And of course a company of this magnitude moves extremely slow to achieve the simplest of things.
Advice: None
Pros: So many brilliant minds to work with! Almost never the smartest person in the room! Never a lack of collaborations with the best of the best!

Cons: Projects require lots of alignment with many stakeholders which is a learning curve but once that’s passed and you make a name for yourself then these alignments become easier
Advice: Share more of the vision (without risking the surprise and delight element)
Pros: Mature tech company that employs people who work smart and operate in a trustworthy manner. Employee friendly in general. Good projects specially in the AIML space.

Cons: I was dramatically overworked and burned out. The pressure is very high, the pace of work is frenetic, and the responsibility on each individual is stressful.

After accounting for the overtime hours I worked, the pay rate evens out with many other non-tech related roles. I could likely have worked 2 full-time jobs and gotten more sleep.
Advice: Work-life balance is needed, not something to acknowledge and then ignore because you need things done. The physical and mental health of your employees degrade when pushed hard, and eventually their performance drops. Pressuring them harder to continue their output will only result in a downward spiral with resentment on both ends before either they leave you have to terminate them.
Pros: The people you work with at Apple are highly intelligent, skilled, passionate, and the best I have every worked with in my career.

The pay is high, and if you can stay with Apple for longer terms, the stock bonuses keep accumulating.

Cons: Very very very very busy.
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits are really nice there.

Cons: Culture, work-life balance, schedule, time away, management in all of miami is horrific

Cons: Limited career development
Lack engeer culture
Advice: None
Pros: Good stock performance. Secure job. Decent pay.

Cons: Very poor work-life balance. Feel like you are constantly working all the time. Very little downtime between projects.
High pressure to provide deliverables with the notion that slips are very costly.
Highly execution oriented work-style, with little opportunities to delve into being inventive.
Very rigid in terms of Vacation offerings and remote working.
For a company that is considering one of the most valuable on the planet, they sure are stingy when it comes to offering perks to their employees.
Expensive Health-insurance and Dental Care compared to other companies.
Advice: Improve work-life balance concerns of employees.
Pros: Excellent ESPP and Annual stock offerings.
Exposure to cutting edge techonology and products.
Very rewarding work. High sense of accomplishment.
Supportive and technically strong colleagues.

Cons: Sometimes they might ask you to join the sales floor with other team members if need be .

You don’t get your own phone line ; you share a email box with the rest of the business team; no real way of making it to corporate rare
Advice: Overall it’s good job better than being on the sales floor and you gain connections with other people easier to grow in the role ; only advice I have is if we find a system that works we don’t need to switch it every quarter 
Pros: Business account manager title is a cool job to have at Apple retail ; you get a 9-5 schedule although you get paid the same as experts on the sales floor you do get a little more perks than them in terms of less micro management; corporate job inside a retail store

Cons: - High expectations and pressure to perform. Apple is known for perfectionism and demanding high quality. This can add stress.

- Secrecy and NDAs. Much of Apple's future product plans are confidential. This limits what engineers can share about their work externally. 

- Bureaucracy of a large company. More red tape and process compared to a startup. Projects take longer to complete.

- Competitive hiring. Very difficult to land a job at Apple due to high number of applicants for each opening.

- Less flexibility andremote work. Apple's culture focuses heavily on collaboration in physical offices, limiting remote work possibilities.

- Potentially lower pay compared to top tech companies given current compensation structure.

Overall, Apple provides a unique experience for engineers to work on cutting-edge consumer technologies, but also comes with expectations of discretion, bureaucracy, and less flexibility than some other companies.
Advice: None
Pros: - Working on cutting-edge technology. Apple is known for innovative products and pushing the boundaries of technology. Engineers get to develop new and exciting technologies.

- Strong work culture and benefits. Apple is known for having a great company culture with healthy work-life balance, generous benefits, and perks like free snacks and devices. 

- Career growth opportunities. As a large and successful company, Apple offers plenty of room for advancement as new projects and teams are constantly being created.

- Product-focused work. Engineers work directly on Apple's flagship consumer products like the iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc. rather than more mundane backend systems.

Cons: Pay, the company doesn't care about their employees, pushing everyone to go to a campus
Advice: Listen to your employees!
Pros: Pay, work from home, some employees

Cons: 100% plugged into work, difficult to on-board

Pros: WFH and good pay at the time 2021

Cons: Lacked work life a balance
Advice: None
Pros: was a great company to work for

Cons: At my store (Fifth Avenue), it was difficult to advance or stand out because there were so many employees and it operated very differently from most other Apple stores. It was difficult to push offerings like small business services and Today @ Apple sessions on customers when the store is a revolving door for tourists with no connection to the local community and/or limited English (easy enough to sell products, but harder to have a sustained conversation about services). On a given day, ~3/4 of my customers were Brazilian tourists buying phones for themselves and friends back home (Brazil charges outrageously high import taxes on Apple products), and they were — understandably — completely uninterested in signing up for business services or sacrificing vacation time to sit in on a Today @ Apple session. The remaining 1/4 of customers would usually be Midtown office workers rushing to grab an accessory or drop off a faulty device before their lunch break was over. Because the store is essentially functions as a mostly-duty-free tourist destination, it was very rare to have leisurely browsing customers who were open to conversation and sustained engagement.
Advice: None
Pros: Excellent benefits (best healthcare I’ve ever had), interesting people, generally positive culture and work/life balance.

Cons: Favoritism is very apparent.

 Opportunities to find full-time positions or promotions are heavily swayed towards favorites. 

Pushing others outside of their responsibilities within their role.
Advice: If management took the time to really look at each employee as a person and not as a metric.

Maybe management is pressured by those above them but there is a very apparent worry about making sure the numbers produced by the store look immaculate for corporate.
Pros: Employee benefits, even at part time, are going to be very difficult to find somewhere else. 

-Tuition Assistance
-Health/Dental/Vision
-Stock Options
-ESPP
-EAP
-Mental Health Services
-Employee Discounts
-Fitness Assistance

A lot of reimbursements that you may have a hard time finding at another company. Hard to list them all. 

From my personal experience, there is a good work culture with the people you work with. They are usually very good people and the bonds created with them typically last long outside of their (or your) time working at the store.

Cons: Hard to take vacation when you need to
Advice: None
Pros: Great training wonderful benefits and remote

Cons: -they ask for alot for it to be a retail job, having to meet business contacts, subscribe them to AppleCare products AT the store
- very slow advancement in the company, some coworkers where in roles for 7+ years and weren't getting promotions as there were very little room for growth as positioning are extremely limited and rarely ended up in corporate positions
-company discount is so low unless its the $500 once a year- discount.
Advice: None
Pros: -good pay for retail
-no sales quota
-great benefits for permanent employees, especially full time

Cons: A bit disorganized and headcount is very team dependent
Advice: Have longer internships and more entry full time offers
Pros: A lot of great mentorship opportunities

Cons: Politics
Favoritism 
Micromanagement
Work life balance 
Lack of transparency
lack of accountability for the leadership team
Advice: I want to make clear that this review it's for the Carolinas Apple Store. I've work in other markets and it's really great, The Carolinas Market is rotten from the Market leader and below, they cover and protect each other and they can get away with everything they do wrong. From wrongful termination, Documented Coachings, Misconducts, Demotions, etc. If you are someone that want to keep your mental health or not make it worst, do Not try to get a Job at any Apple Store in the Carolinas Market.
Pros: Benefits
Diversity
Co Workers
Credo
Skill development

Cons: Work life balance might be tough if you are in supply chain
Advice: None
Pros: Great Pay, Smart People and Amazing Mission

Cons: - Hyper PC (Politically Correct) to a fault
- Towards my later years felt uneasy talking to anyone because ppl would get fired for making someone feel uncomfortable &amp; no grounds to stand on for such accusations
- Not the start up owned by Steve it once was, a far cry actually. Major corporation that only seems to care about the money and stock and nothing else unlike it’s earlier years. So if that doesn’t bother you then it’s a fine place to work.
Advice: I don’t even know what Tim Cook does. All I can tell is that he is a big proponent of Gay Rights (and rightfully so) but… I have 0 idea what he does for the company, have felt no personal connection to him, his presence is not felt, and he is simply just the name on top of a Legacy corporation that is seemingly more and more focused on “safe” moves, to a fault.
Pros: - Good pay
- Probably the largest amount of benefits from a company
- Beautiful campus &amp; locations
- Many different positions to fit many different personalities

Cons: Good old boys club, look for young people, not older folks, all about who you know
Advice: Get back to basics, to much politics now and age discrimination
Pros: Progressive company, some opportunities if you are lucky

Pros: Benefits, pay, respect. Best package for retail.

Cons: You will be working with A LOT customers.

Pros: Pay and benefits are really good for a part-time level job. Internal rotation opportutnies are great for career growth.

Cons: It’s sometimes hard to move up as there are always many people that you are competing with.
Co-op opportunities are hard to get as you typically need to spend years at the company before you are recommended
Advice: None
Pros: Apple is very accommodating with training and preparation for the role. They provide you everything you need to know to succeed at the job.
A lot of opportunity to pivot to sales, technical or creative sides of the store.

Cons: The process of changing hours of availability took way too long to go into effect
Advice: Management seemed a little disorganized and not in great communication with each other 
Pros: Fun place to work plus you meet really interesting and unique people

Cons: Low Raises Not Commensurate with Inflation
Advice: None
Pros: Flexibility in Scheduling &amp; Work

Cons: Same as most customer facing jobs, your experience with fussy customers really depends on your personal emotional fortitude. Days can get pretty tough if you're unable to make a friend on the team with a similar shift schedule.
Advice: Hold more of an interest in personal development with each member of the team. Management tends to get too bogged down with back-office work and relies mostly on more experienced non-management to keep everyone else in line.
Pros: Great company discounts and benefits, especially if you love their products, and an energetic environment you'll never be tired of working at.

Cons: high working times i spent in the company
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Has the most amazing people

Cons: the workload continually piles and the management reviews and connections are hollow
Advice: None
Pros: the culture is relaxed and progressive

Cons: Retail is difficult. It is a lot of work and not enough people to support the non-stop influx of customers. every area of the store feels like it 15-20% understaffed. It did not used to feel this way all the time like it does now. It's exhausting the leaders and the team.
Advice: Listen to the people. We are telling you that we're all worn out way down here in retail. Great/ Amazing people are leaving because growth has all but stopped and people are overworked.
Pros: Apple has taken care of my family and I for 16 years. Benefits and very competitive pay. Covid was unbelievable. We not only keep all of our jobs but prospered and went back to work as soon as we were able.

Cons: There are not many bad reasons
Advice: None
Pros: There are lots of good reasons

Cons: Last Fall, a lot of employees got a shock: tiny salary increases, and little-to-nothing in the way of a bonus or stock. Despite persistently high inflation. Despite working evenings and weekends. Despite delivering quality products on schedule. 

When employees voiced their concerns about stress, management replied, “Download a stress app”. When employees voiced their concerns about pay, management replied, "Take a career course". Or relocate to San Diego. Better yet, we’ll relocate you. To Austin.
Advice: Treat us like human beings.  Why is it OK for you to live in the Bay Area, but not us?  Why can you keep your family and your life in the Bay Area, but we can’t?  Why can you afford to pay yourselves so much, but you can’t pay us?  We're the ones making the products.
Pros: Great benefits. Employee discounts. Subsidized cafeteria.

Cons: Poor work vs home management. Inflated sense of purpose using what I view frankly as cult tactics to convince you are doing powerful meaningful work in the world. Very poor utilization of internal talent with little to no room for advancement.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and overall fair pay. Certainly builds your skills and abilities to take on complex issues.

Cons: Lack of in-depth training outside of Genius Bar level specialists.
Advice: Give floor specialists more technological knowledge on the products.

Pros: Benefits are really great here

Cons: Really none, I’ve found happiness and balance
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits, people, growth opportunities, all around a great place to be

Cons: Very little in the way of upward mobility. It seems that once people join this company in an elevated role they rarely leave. When positions to come up, there tends to be a lot of favoritism behind the scenes and candidates are chosen based on existing relationships with Market Leaders.
Advice: None
Pros: Continued development, constant challenges and collaboration. A very good place to start a career in management

Cons: Unsympathetic management and not many benefits compared to other tech companies
Advice: None

Pros: Good benefits and worklife balance

Advice: None
Pros: get to work with smart people everyday

Cons: Schedule, management, no opportunity to work part-time which resulted in poor work/life balance. Lack of opportunity to move up within the company.
Advice: None
Pros: Not the best remote company to work for, but certainly not the worst. Avoid becoming a senior advisor and you might be okay.

Cons: none at all , overal great place to work.
Advice: None
Pros: benefits
Discounts

Advice: None
Pros: Pay, work life balance, great work environment

Cons: Management could be annoying. They were weird sometimes.
Advice: None
Pros: Cool people to work with

Cons: Some cons were there was a new situation everyday, which you have to mentally prepare for. Any retail job is mentally draining, however being a sales specialist is definitely mentally exhausting. There were some times where we had situations that were bad, and left workers crying. Most managers don't understand how to navigate around using our work devices and barely provide support to employees. If you are hired as a seasonal, I would say definitely have a back up option, there's absolutely no guarantee if you are going to have a spot. I was one of the few that was lucky to get offered a spot, but it truly does depend on your work effort. The way to schedule days off is somewhat inconvenient because they require you to submit at least a month and a half in advance.
Advice: Managers need to support employees without getting frustrated, and genuinely show support.
Pros: I believe some pros of working at Apple are definitely the benefits that come along with working there, as well as the pay. It's definitely one of the better paying retail jobs in my opinion.

Cons: Very busy during certain times of the year
Advice: More pizza parties for employees
Pros: Amazing benefits and work life balance.

Team work
Training (time off phone)

Cons: No cons worth mentioning great place to start your career I cant think of a better retail experience so far
Advice: Keep it up
Pros: Great place to work
The hiring process is built to always have great people to work with

Cons: Managers are human and they have intense bonus contracts that make them back stabby.
Most Apple customers are the worst on the planet. They are entitled. They lie, cheat and try to force you into giving them everything under the sun. They are racist, sexist, and homophobic. They make women, people of color and trans people repeat everything 2- 3 times affecting their metrics that give them raises. This causes women, people of color and LGBTIA+ people to make less and take more abuse than their white, cis, heterosexual male counterparts.
No one has a regular schedule. No one gets 2 days off to rest and relax unless they are on vacation. 
Clopenings are a weekly experience.
Advice: Management needs to recognize the biases in their store market and work to counteract the abuse that their staff deal with on an hourly basis. Management needs to do the work on themselves to deconstruct their own biases to support their staff.  
Retail stores need to work to empower their staff like the mothership. 
Retail workers should have the option to join a union instead of being fired. 
Pros: Insurance benefits are amazing
Discounts on apple products are amazing
Staying on the cutting edge of the latest and greatest at apple is amazing
You end up working with the best people on the planet.

Cons: If you’re trying to move up within apple it can become very political but that’s any job I guess. Not really a whole lot of cons if you have reasonable expectations. I guess you can get drained from dealing with entitled customers all day.
Advice: None
Pros: The average employee is super cool
A lot of staff so easy to pick up shifts
Not a whole lot of micro managing
Hard to get let go

Cons: everyone else is a robot. no emotional intelligence is 0. Expected to be on 24/7.

Pros: immediate team will likely be good

Cons: Long hours at the weekend. You won't have any free time outside of work and school
Advice: None
Pros: Apple retail pay well for a part time job as a college student. This job covers most of my expenses in college

Cons: - intense job and learning curve
Advice: None
Pros: - nice staff, and caring company

Cons: Leadership is very condescending. Pay is not competitive anymore since company is trying to go into achieving sales numbers. NO commission given. Has forgotten about the internal customer.
Advice: None
Pros: this is one of the best RETAIL job you can have. Great benefits and stock options. Co workers are great aka employees not leadership

Cons: customer service is not the best
Advice: None
Pros: pay for home office and wifi

Cons: The leaders were great, but the management was a different story. Moving to a new position always meant going through an interview process, no matter how long you'd been with the company. This usually involved two interviews with our store's management, which often felt like cold calls. Plus, management frequently showed favoritism and often had a poor attitude towards the team.
Advice: None
Pros: The team is great, and you often have a great time.
Very good benefits.

Cons: I don’t have any cons working with Apple. N last schedule I guess isn’t ideal
Advice: None
Pros: I believe the environment is best in class

Cons: No amenities--if you aren't in Cupertino you don't even get a cafeteria (in Cupertino you have to pay for food). No career progression (they're 'working on it' but my expectations are low). Poor location options (and no career development if you're not in Cupertino and they want you in Cupertino but they don't want more people in Cupertino?)
We're still 'business critical' travel only, with no conference/training budget. I've paid my own way to go to conferences to keep up my skills and connections and I even have to take time off or remote time to attend. Yet Tim goes to the Super Bowl?
Leadership is out of touch with anyone who isn't in management (honestly anyone beyond a first line manager has no clue what's going on with employees). Even if you aren't in Cupertino, you have to work Cupertino hours (yep, even if you live in Europe).
Advice: Please just talk to someone at the leaves of your management tree. You are so out of touch.
Pros: The pay is decent, benefits are better than average for corporate America, but worse compared to tech companies (healthcare is good but expensive). Some bosses are really great. We haven't had layoffs and it feels pretty stable.

Cons: The south bay is not the nicest place to live.
Advice: None
Pros: Apple is a great place to do great work.

Cons: Fast-Paced Environment: The fast-paced nature of the work can be demanding and may require long hours at times to meet deadlines.
High Expectations: With Apple's reputation for excellence, there can be high expectations for performance, which may lead to pressure to deliver consistently exceptional results.
Limited Work-Life Balance: While efforts are made to accommodate work-life balance, the demanding nature of the job may sometimes make it challenging to maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life.
Competitive Environment: The competitive nature of the tech industry and Apple's high standards may create a challenging environment where employees need to constantly strive for excellence.
Limited Autonomy: Some employees may find that the company's strong emphasis on collaboration and teamwork leaves limited room for individual autonomy in decision-making.
Advice: None
Pros: Innovative Culture: Apple fosters a culture of innovation and creativity, encouraging employees to push boundaries and think outside the box.
Impactful Work: As a Product Marketing Manager, you get to work on groundbreaking products that have a significant impact on the industry and people's lives.

Cons: Work Life home balance not great
Pay was not competitive considering the amount of work
Advice: None
Pros: Great perks, discounts, most coworkers are awesome people

Cons: Apple retail has fallen from grace. Far too much time spent on non-business related activities and focuses. Not nearly enough staff. Leadership that is wildly inconsistent or non-existent.
Advice: Live up to your Credo.
Pros: Great people, engaging environment, fantastic customer service support.

Cons: Hiring freeze and not many opportunities to move into different areas of the business; cult like work culture
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: -people you work with are great

Cons: Retail hours. Heavy emphasis on metrics.

Cons: I just came to see the reviews of a company my friend works for.

Cons: It is very difficult to move up unless you say the right things. Even if you are well-liked, if you cannot speak “Apple”, good luck on any type of promotion. Also, unless you’re full-time, say goodbye to any type of work-life balance. Your schedule will be all over the place.
Advice: I understand how important culture is to corporate Apple. But I have seen people who have been looked over for promotion who do the work and have been there for 7 years or longer. Thus, it’s a dead end job for most employees.

Cons: -you will be stretched THIN. when you work at apple retail, you are expected to do every single job in the store, no matter how short-staffed your current position is. 
-things get VERY political and dramatic when it comes to promotions, and there is SO much favoritism used, as well as subtle racism (depending on location).
-they say they'll help you advance, but many have realized that this is a farce. there are so many hard workers in the same positions they were in over 5 years ago who have the necessary skills to move along in the company, but office politics and favoritism comes into play.
-too much sucking up to bosses necessary. if you dont, you will be targeted to be removed from the company very aggressively
-the customers. the customers. the customers. so entitled, and this is retail.
Advice: None
Pros: -the benefits they offer you are fantastic, and more than likely the main reason you would stick around for so long. 
-the pay is good, especially for retail, but you will be stretched THIN. when you work at apple retail, you are expected to do every single job in the store, no matter how short-staffed your current position is. things get VERY political and dramatic when it comes to promotions, and there is SO much favoritism used, as well as subtle racism (depending on location).

No work life balance
Advice: None
Pros: Wfh I’m s good
Benefits are good

Cons: - no work-life balance, basically to have any weekend off you need to schedule it at least a month in advance. They will allow you to have one weekend day off a week but it comes with multiple rules, such as you cant have two in a row; or its every other week. Then if you manage to schedule several weekends in a row off, then management will have a conversation with you, saying that youre not properly supporting the team. 
- decent amount of micro-managing which is semi necessary 
- Metric based performance &gt; Which isnt the problem, its that if youre not doing well they use fear mongering basically saying youll lose your job if you dont perform to expectations.

Pros: You will find how really bad teams and managers behave

Cons: Customers are horrible. Currently not backfilling positions so stores are feeling more and more understaffed. Expectations for work are extremely high and sometimes unachievable.
Advice: Apple is going to start losing some excellent talent in the retail stores due to lack of opportunities for growth. It is unbelievable to expect someone to take on an extra 30+ minute commute to the next nearest store for a $4 an hour raise because that’s the only one with an opening.
Pros: Great benefits, coworkers are awesome, weekend day off option for full timers which is typically unheard of in retail.

10+ Working hours daily
Advice: Please hire more people. Everyone is working 2-3 people’s job and its not sustainable

Advice: None
Pros: - amazing people
- easy to see your impact

- Company is stingy. Makes employees pay for everything

Cons: Everything else. They like to say that they build culture and people but its a sham.
Advice: Give people breaks, Actually listen to your employees, Have better management or better training of management. Have better systems in place for dealing with very rude customers. 
Pros: The people I worked with who were my peers.

Cons: There are people that work their way up the ladder and go from retail to corporate but there are biases that lead one person to get a job over another. The biggest con is the fact that you can apply for a job and go up against someone who already has that exact same job title they are obviously going to get the job over you because they have the direct experience already. I say it's unfair... but life is unfair. So..
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible Scheduling. Excellent Health benefits. Fun workplace. Easy enough.

Advice: None
Pros: - decent pay for a retail job

- discounts
- benefits for part time employees

Cons: Apple is a company that has mastered the "golden handcuffs" - as a mentor I routinely helped retrain employees coming back from mental health leaves because the role of back to back phonecalls was giving them anxiety breakdowns. A lot of times they would call out during retraining and go back out on leave or flat out quit.
Advice: Just ditch the phones. You let customers abuse employees to mental health episodes and just cycle them out. I had to quit because my therapist told me she was worried about me and Apple refused to just let me do chat support, instead. They said hey, we hired you for phones, we have no need for you anywhere else - and that's fine, but just know that is how Apple works. If you're on phones - you're just a step under chat (who also has mental health breakdowns, just not as often)

Unorganized in high rush situations

Pros: the place was clean already

Cons: Extremely stressful workplace environment.
Management is disconnected and often time has no idea what the overall situation is. Also severely ignorant of employee well being and feedback. They love to give it, and encourage subordinate employees to do so as well. However when it’s given it is met with a blank stare, a fake smile, and head nod and no further engagement or follow up. Yet when they give feedback they will literally follow you around, interrupt customer engagements making things incredibly tense and awkward all while being critical for your the sole reason of “acting like a manager” and not for sincerely trying to help you develop as an employee. Managers are often hired externally and internal ladder climbing is extremely difficult. 
No performance based bonuses of any kind, nothing much to incentivize hard work. Yet management profits off of employee performance and metrics via bonuses. 
Awful work life balance. 
It’s an incredibly stressful retail environment shown as being different from other places with sugary words and fake smiles. 
Potential for career development is next to non existent as the company for the last few years has severely limited upward growth and hiring for new positions.
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits for both part time and full time employees. 
Employee stock purchase plan. 
Employee environment (save management and corporate) is made up of some fantastic people.

Cons: work can get busy sometimes
Advice: None
Pros: Very interesting work and amazing team

Cons: It's retail and you're operating according to mall hours, which is the biggest con. This is something you know from the start.
Advice: I wasn't a fan of the manager I reported to. It seemed as of he was just going through the motions day in and day out. My advice for management would be to promote employees to upper management that really have a passion for developing others. 
Pros: When I began working there in 2018 it had such a family vibe. We were all close and that made it easy for me to want to go to work each and everyday. The pay and benefits at the time were great and the opportunity for growth within the store was limitless.

Cons: the information doesn't get across very smoothly.
Advice: None

Cons: work life balance is not the greatest

Cons: Schedule/work life balance
Micromanagement 
Biased feedback 
Opportunity for Growth 
Opportunity for growth in salary
Advice: None

Culture
Training
Discounts
Volunteer Matching

Advice: None
Pros: Stock plan, bonuses, campus is great.

Cons: Unless you are within the inner circles of the right groups, you won't get where you want. Life balance is something they "champion" but it's non existent.
Advice: Circa 2011, employees were treat like corporate employees. The bottom line did not matter as much so long as we were happy. Happy employee led to happy customers. 
Pros: You make some life long friends along the way.

Cons: Long hours, micro-management and weekend work.
Advice: Trust your employees more. Team specific. 
Pros: Stability and surrounded by smart, driven coworkers.

Cons: I found that Apple sometimes had some disconnect from corporate to retail in terms of truly listening and actioning on feedback from the employees of Apple Retail.
Advice: None
Pros: I worked at Apple Boylston while studying in Boston. I loved the people I worked with and the benefits afforded to even the part-time employees of the company.

Cons: nothing bad to say at all
Advice: None
Pros: great team and work environment

Cons: This is where I am gonna let loose a bit. Things at Apple changed after covid to a point where micro management has been running rampant. The need to gain revenue out weighs the customer journey as well as set base procedures. Management claims that they are transparent but in reality they never have any clear insight or direction. Management also finds it funny to talk about employees behind there backs and do not want to held accountable when appraoched about the matter. If you are looking to join Apple retail be prepared to be over worked to the point where burnout becomes the norm.
Advice: Listen to your team, help them, and if there is a issue have there backs. Also learn to be accountable for your negative actions. Lead by example though we all know thats not gonna happen just seeing how things have been!
Pros: I have had the opportunity to work with some really creative folks. The benefits are good with a lot of discounts on cellular services and products. The pay wasnt bad either for a retail job.

Cons: Most of the great opportunities in this company is not available to remote workers. Make sure you can move on site or you will be in a dead end.
Advice: None
Pros: They are generous with paid time off and it is usually very easy to take. Before inflation went insane in this area, it was good pay.

Cons: -not many opportunities for full time
-part time health insurance sucks
-the worst customers, expected to be a mini-manager, they teach you how to try to align with customers but honestly it’s really hard to deal with people who have insane expectations about what can be done to solve their issue and every. Many people who aren’t entirely mentally there frequent this establishment. You’re going to have to help people who think the cia is after them or many other things. People who are the worst at managing their emotions will be the people you need to help. This isn’t regular retail. I’ve worked retail 9 years and this is next level. It’s so draining and toxic.
-HR fires people very easily. Best to keep to yourself instead of trying to be yourself at work. I know multiple people fired who were just venting to coworkers. 
-this is the kind of place where you have to send recaps of conversations to managers because they will say something and then change their mind the next time you talk to them and say they never said that.
-it’s so understaffed, many people have left and their spots were not back filled. Feels like every day it gets busier and less staffed.
Advice: Stop being anti-union, respect people with disabilities,
Pros: -decent wage for retail
-sort of flexible schedule for retail
-you get sick time and vacation 
-stock options and 401k match are nice

Cons: Scheduling makes it hard to have consistency outside of work.

Pros: Good pay and good growth oppys

Cons: Nothing that I can think of.
Advice: None
Pros: A Good entry level job

Cons: Do more with less is becoming Apple's approach to employees. Be prepared to be asked for more than what Apple values you at.
Advice: Please stop telling people this job is different from other sales jobs, that is a lie.
Pros: The pay is great for college students.

Cons: For me, I was a little too old for the retail hour life. Not even a con of the job or the company, obviously, but that's the only thing that let me to leave.
Advice: None
Pros: The benefits and health coverage at Apple, even for part-time employees, was phenomenal. And if you're in Austin, getting access to all the on-site medical professionals and offices at the main campus here makes things even more convenient and wonderful.

Cons: Long hours and a lot of expectations
Advice: None
Pros: Good shared values within team

Advice: None
Pros: friendly, life balance, no dress code

Cons: One needs to put in extra time learning, and working with the public is *always* a challenge.
Advice: They're actually fine at my store.
Pros: Especially for part-time, the benefits are great. The company bends over backwards to try to make a good working environment. For the most part I think they succeed.

allowed to call out for emergencies without suspicion or guilt trips

Cons: Expectations are high and meeting them at times may extend into personal time.
Advice: None
Pros: You'll work with some of the smartest people you've ever met.

Advice: Care about your employee's contributions even when it doesn't personally benefit you.
Pros: Benefits and stability are the overall pros

Advice: None

Cons: I didn't know of any downsides.
Advice: None
Pros: The store was accommodating, and the managers were super flexible with their employees.

Cons: Retail hours. Painfully crowded work environment. Customers will be awful to you &amp; you will see people at their worst. You’ll be lied to, every day. Store leadership has their preferiti, to be on the outside of that group looking in is maddening. Traditional work ethic is not valued, Even if you put your all into your role you may not advance unless you meet the store’s unspoken demographic needs. Store &amp; regional leadership maintain a cult-like devotion to a credo, which will destroy your mental health if you do not completely subscribe. The technical skills you develop are only useful in an Apple Store, the special tools you’ll rely on are rarely available outside of apple.
Advice: None,

Advice: Put some pants on if you're free balling.
Pros: It was fun and a little sexy.

Cons: No real ownership over your journey at the company. No real ownership of your time. Treated poorly by customers without any real support from management. Company spends ridiculous amount of time and resources on convincing their employees that they work for an incredible company, instead of actually making working conditions better, sustainable, or competitive. In truth, most people who work for the retail stores are treated as absolutely disposable if they do not appear enthusiastic for their sub-par working conditions.
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits are decent for a part-time job

Advice: None
Pros: Good company to work for, many advancement opprotunites

Cons: not a downside i think now
Advice: None
Pros: good company reliable helpful great

Cons: Overtime, management became micromanaging. Favoritism gets to an all time high. The mental health of employees is extremely pushed. 80% of your life and time is absorbed by the company. Micro-aggressions are definitely apart of the culture in the retail stores, even though they claim to be zero tolerance. People of a certain color get penalized swiftly with the harshest consequences, while certain others are given an infinite amount of chances for the same offense or worse.
Advice: None
Pros: Overall benefits were great, you got a lot of discounts with different companies. Pay was somewhat decent. You get to meet a great, diverse group of people to work with. You get to learn a lot of new skills in tech.

Pros: Great benefits
Flexible hours based on your schedule 
Clear shifts
Great staff

Cons: Career progression in retail can be stagnant.
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture and benefits for full time employees.

Cons: Depending on your org, there can be a lot of work and/or politics to navigate. While the company has been going through a lot of macroeconomic turbulence over the last couple years, the company has done very little to incentivize their top talent to stay while the stock has been dropping (i.e. small bonuses and raises, no improvements to perks and benefits, etc.). The tech sector outside is doing pretty well, so it's clear a lot of people are starting to look over the fence for greener pastures elsewhere.
Advice: Please do more to address your workforce's concerns in these challenging times.
Pros: Lots of very smart folks working hard on a mission most truly believe in: to produce the best products ever for all consumers in the world.

Cons: The growth and development is limited. Being a retail store, there is only so much you can do to move up and only so many positions available. Going from retail to corp is very hard to do.

Occasional Rude Customers

Pros: RSU’s. Pay. COURSERA. Apple now pays up to 100% for advanced degrees. The people

Cons: nothing much if youre diligent
Advice: None
Pros: top company ever, stay strong

Cons: -Continuously adding new repsonsibilities without an increase in salary
-Some instances put us in untenable positions with customers
-Upper management seems to pay lip service to the issues that affect the folks on the phone
-No advancement to other positions for AHA (At Home Advisors) or other career opportunities, unless we relocate, and some of us simply can't do that.
Advice: Start adding a salary increase when new repsonsibilities are added, when I started, I supported iOS devices... I opted to add Mac skills as well.  Since then, I have been given Apple TV, Beats, AirPods, Creative Media applications, Apple TV+ App, HomePods/HomeApp/Smart home devices to go along with supporting iPhones, iPads, and all Macs.  I don't care if the responsibilities were added, what I care about is the amount of work I am being asked to take on, without an increase in salary.
Pros: -Good benefits
-Good work-life balance
-Stock plan
-Decent management at the team level

Cons: They will not accommodate your disability needs.

Advice: None
Pros: Easy job and good pay

You don’t get promoted for your hard work 
You get yelled at 99% of the time
Advice: Managers need to be humbled 
Pros: Great benefits and pay kinda

Cons: This specific store has 2 sides, the side you see on the sales floor has nice and supportive managers, friendly staff and an inclusive environment. However, the other side (management) is surprisingly the complete opposite. Managers constantly talk badly about the people that work for them, saying inappropriate and controversial things about these employees who bend over backwards to appease this company's metrics and you're expected to agree with these terrible things said about the people we are managing. It's honestly disgusting. I've had a manager tell me, "what's said in this office stays in this office". That's when I knew I would not fit in here. I wish I reported my many encounters when I worked for this organization but I was afraid of the retaliation that I would face. However, there are definitely those who feed into their toxic ways and work their way to the top of this organization. So, if you specialize in a** kissing then this is the place to work. But if you like to play fair, follow code of conduct and treat everyone equally don't even bother because you will be outlawed by the insanity that happens behind management doors.
Advice: It will never change.
Pros: You can get away with anything especially if you're "liked" by the current store manager.

Cons: Retail has its own caveats, such as long scheduling hours, and it can be difficult to translate skills to transition to corporate roles.
Advice: None
Pros: Apple is a great company to work for with great benefits for its employees.

Cons: The most exhausting aspect of this job is the extent to which leaders are required to babysit the team. Everyone takes extended paid leaves of absence for several months, returns to work for a brief period, and then goes on leave again. There are no repercussions for this pattern. However, although half of the team is on leave, we are still expected to drive the same results as if we were fully staffed at all times. The way our results are measured is not equitable.
Advice: None
Pros: If you want to continue pursuing your retail career, Apple is the best company for it. The compensation is the best; you get to work with innovative people.

Advice: Micromanagement poses a myriad of detrimental effects on the workplace. It not only frustrates employees but also leaves room for errors on both ends. Moreover, its lack of scalability makes it an inefficient management approach, diverting managers from focusing on the bigger picture. The trust between employees and management can be damaged, leading to increased burnout among both managers and teams. Additionally, the overreliance on micromanagement can create a culture of dependency and ultimately contribute to a higher turnover rate within the organization. Therefore, I will not be coming back

The technical roles became less technical and management became unbearable.

Pros: Great Company and Products, Customers were great to work with

Cons: Become too siloed and highly specialized, bad management, don’t hire from within, culture of secrecy and lies
Advice: None
Pros: Great products, cutting edge issues

Cons: The management is all pressuring each other constantly which trickles down to them pressuring the staff below them in order to save themselves.
Advice: None
Pros: Fun and very tech based company to work for.

Cons: Higher-level management had difficulty setting project direction well for R&amp;D work, making it difficult to achieve goals
Advice: None
Pros: Insanely smart and talented co-workers, decent work/life balance, interesting projects, good compensation

Cons: Could theoretically make more or get better WLB or benefits elsewhere but probably not all at the same time, lots of specialization among teams so you don't necessarily get the chance to learn as much skill variety as you would at a smaller company where you have to do PCB, SW, automation, and testing yourself. Disclosure system closes off a lot of interesting education to people in other teams.
Advice: Forced in-office for all isn't needed or helpful for most since so much of the work is asynchronous anyway. Too much info silo-ing makes skill building harder for earlier engineers. More hotel cubes in whatever office is convenient regardless of team would be very helpful for many. Overall still good.
Pros: Stable, interesting problems, plenty of available resources to do it right, solid set of pay and benefits. Work with some of the smartest folks around so lots to learn.

Cons: There wasn't that much direction/oversight, which would be a good thing potentially for someone who really knows what they want to do and wants the freedom, but it can be unnerving, Also, the pay is good, but not necessarily commensurate with the outrageous cost of living (rent/housing prices) of the Bay Area

Advice: None
Pros: Love the company and the science

Cons: - Scheduling (work weekends, have to stay flexible on holidays)
- Some managers are not very skilled or helpful
- Customers can become very entitled and grouchy
- You can do an easier job somewhere else and get paid more
Advice: Quit it with the kool-aid and respect that many people in Apple Stores are here for a paycheck, not a religious awakening. We would have long meetings praising Apple's values and achievements and 1.) They weren't well organized or presented, and 2.) Everyone (including other management) felt they were a waste of time.

- Good resources available for improvement.
- Competitive pay scale for the amount of work you do.
- Smattering of benefits.
- Part-time health insurance benefits.

Pros: nice food and I liked the food

Cons: upper management views you as a number
currently a hiring freeze for specialized departments
customer service is exhausting
Advice: Instead of managers just being the hammer for area managers, try to fight for your service employees. Upper management has such a statistical broad overview of everything, they don't understand what goes on on call to get the numbers they're looking at, and there's a huge disconnect between service workers and the "higher ups", who are just incompetent as they view service members because of a spreadsheet that makes them feel important, because they can do basic math.
Pros: great benefits

the cafe is nice

Cons: - There are some groups that have bad cultures. Mine is not like that but I notice it within some other orgs and groups. 
- Some groups are understaffed and it is noticeable, usually shows itself by rude and aggressive behaviors toward others.
Advice: None
Pros: - Great financial benefits
- Good work life balance (there are a lot of exaggerations about Apple on this. I agree there are bad managers as well but I personally think the overall workload is not much, at least in my own group)

seniors are lost 

store leaders are lost
Advice: None
Pros: good team

good benefits

good discounts

Cons: To much of a contractor vendor game going on with resources. Employees who used to work for the vendors seemed to be protective of those relationships and not looking to hire outside those relationships. It just seemed to be more about a H1B visa game at the management level and a company skirting the "contractor" vs employee rules. No problem with the awesome ICs at all (contractors or full-time)
Advice: None
Pros: A lot of really focused and engaged talent. Some really good Apple culture training.

Cons: No work life balance
No room for growth
Advice: None
Pros: Employee Benefits
Employee Discount
Stock purchase option

Cons: Professional growth and development almost nonexistent. No budget to attend outside professional workshops, etc. Promotions are few and far between—expect to do the same job for years. Instructional designers are limited to content development using internal tools only. No use of tools like Storyline or Captivate. Bureaucratic — lots and lots of meetings, slow decision making, resistance to change, risk aversion, check-the-box mindset.
Advice: Management needs to explore professional growth and development opportunities and embrace fresh ideas. Too many leaders in AppleCare Training have only ever worked at Apple and seem unaware of changes and evolution in the industry outside Apple.
Pros: I worked in AppleCare Training. Wonderful, positive people with a broad range of experience. Benefits were amazing. Very stable -never worried about my job. Highly supportive of entry-level employees.

Cons: Commission could be better and pay more
Advice: None
Pros: I enjoy workitn with my trammates

Cons: Macro management.
Limited opportunities for growth - especially if you're in retail stores or at-home
Advice: Get to know your team, where they excel &amp; help them get there. 

Relevant feedback is more powerful/useful BEFORE the opportunity for  a position arrives. It doesnt feel good to be groomed &amp; encouraged to follow your dreams then have them dashed because your manager doesn't know you or didn't support you.

Cons: Insular community makes for tense situations and forced hangouts. however, it's just an inconvenience.

Cons: No cons to report, it was very nice.
Advice: None
Pros: Everything is great, they really care.

Cons: Even though it’s better pay, it’s still not enough. For as much money as Apple makes you’d think they’d pay retail workers a bit more. If you’re in Apple corporate you’re golden but retail gets scraps.
Advice: Pay better, care about your staff better. Treat us like we’re important too.
Pros: Stocks, good benefits, better pay than your average retail job , good people

Cons: They yelled at me when I kept saying, "It's Apple Time".

Advice: None
Pros: Great people to work with, and a company that actually cares.

Cons: When I was first hired at Apple, there were clear career paths available for me to advance and grow within the company. However, as time passed, it became evident that management was unable to support me and my colleagues in progressing our careers. There were no open positions, and little to no resources provided for interview preparation or professional development. As a result, I became increasingly frustrated with the lack of support for upward growth within the company.

They emphasized "work-life balance" but refused to compromise on flexible scheduling and PTO, and harshly retaliated against call-outs.

Pros: Some of the best people you'll meet work there!

Cons: Post-pandemic, WAH standards have become lax, causing a knee-jerk reaction that has leveled morale and caused innovation and communication to plummet. Since our Social Response and Advisor/ Senior Advisor roles have quietly closed, along with Senior Chat Advisor roles, soon AppleCare will be gone - handled by our very smart Automated Assistant and our vendor employees. 

Gone are the days of being an expert. Mass communication and one-fix-fits-all is the trajectory - so very not Apple like.

Advice: Horrible working expectations for family work life balance. Family/spouses are expected to accept their significant others to report to work “over night” from 10:pm to 6:am the next morning, in person at the Apple Corp office. It’s bad enough with all of the “ disclosed projects” creating secrecy amongst family dynamics but making employees spend the night at work is ridiculous and unacceptable…these expectations are part of the reason for our divorce. Tearing families apart, great job Apple!

Advice: None
Pros: Pay, benefits, people, and experience.

Cons: Job is monotonous and boring.
Everyone works individually so no one talks and that's kinda depressing.
The snacks they bring in actually suck they need to ask people what they want because some of the stuff they bring us I wouldn't give to my dog.
Pay sucks for an adult with any responsibility.
You need a degree to get this job....why?
Everyone on site hates there job in an almost comical way. (probably because everyone is over qualified, under payed and old like seriously hire younger people that dont have as many commitments and fire the people that are under preforming)
If you work this job and your over 25 your actually a loser or at least that's the vibe i get from people that work here like come on you have a degree and your doing this.... seriously?
People that under-preform don't get fired and its super demoralizing to know you can work hard and still get paid the same as the guy who sits next to you watching anime all day. 
Very little opportunity to move up in the company or make connections and network. 
Forget getting promoted even if your working hard their only so many senior positions and only the TOP performer is getting in aka not you.
Im not even sure what the managers even do other than pretend to work i mean seriously they just talk all day, stop talking and bring me my snacks.
Upper management is clueless to the changes that need to be made to run our branch effectively.  
Advice: LAY PEOPLE OFF FOR THE LOVE OF GOD YOU DON'T NEED A DEGREE OF TYPE ON A KEYBOARD AND KNOW A LANGUAGE. YOU CAN EVEN PAY PEOPLE LESS YOU GREEDY PIGS. JUST HIRE YOUNGER AND WELL DO BETTER. HIRE 18 YEAR OLDS. HIRE IMMIGRANTS.
Pros: Decent place to work for a young person.
Much better than working fast food or customer service.
Job is mind numbingly easy .
Job is low stress and you have to be brain-dead to get fired.
Benefits at the company are nice.
If you can read and write you can do this job any bum off the street can do this job.
you can be on your phone all day and no one cares. 
management is pretty chill.
They buy you food sometimes and also free snacks they say you can only take two but i take however many I feel like just because.

Cons: TL; DR:

- Near zero growth opportunity within AppleCare, and very hard to be seen as a viable candidate to the rest of Apple.
- Career growth pacification programs that provide no real advancement or growth.
- Restrictive rotation and career experience programs. Rather than allowing you to flourish and apply for real world experiences from other departments as much as you'd like, you are restricted to once every six months to a year. 
- Every six months your schedule will likely change, upending your personal life.
- You get hired for a specific role, then get various other roles dumped on you with no pay raise.
- Management will randomly move you around to different managers, desks for no reason. 
- Management either does not care about you, or has no power to make real change when necessary, so they just BS around everything. 

Oh man. I've grown into a bit of a curmudgeon during my time here, so I've definitely got cons. Despite what some will ultimately believe is some sad sack who sabotages themselves into being where they are, that is not the case. I'm not saying that my feelings haven't spilled out over the years, but I mainly keep this stuff inside and uphold composure. All of this stuff is true. 

- Sadly, if you have a hunger and desire to grow your career and advance within Apple and you came to AppleCare (AC) thinking that this would at least be a nice starting place, you have chosen poorly. AC is where talented individuals get trapped within a sea of mediocrity and complacency. So many people are just "meh" and have no desire to advance, therefore you cannot advance within the organization, and since it's Apple, it's already extremely competitive, so when opportunities that you would qualify for (which are few and far between unless you're a hardware engineer or programmer with years of experience) open up, it's nearly impossible to stand out to a recruiter for them to even give you the time of day. 

- Because the executive and upper management level of AC know that there are next to zero opportunities due to the competitive nature of Apple, they have created a career growth program designed to make you feel like they care, like there is possible opportunity, and that this program will somehow benefit you, despite it not providing much in the way of anything. They have "career coaches" that have barely had a career themselves (seriously, they had the same job that you have right now, then became coaches. Give me someone who has actually advanced), they give you free access to Coursera, which is nice, but it does nothing to make up for the lack of experience or education most roles require, and it offers what are called "rotations" which is where you work for another team for up to six months getting real world experience likely doing a job that you'd actually want to do (but without the pay), however the likelihood of getting a job from a rotation is about as likely as you getting struck by lightning on a clear day in the desert as the majority of the orgs that offer rotations are given zero budget for additional headcount. They are perpetually stuck rotating new people in and out every six months. They hate it as much as we do. They wish they could hire some of us as much as we wish we could be hired. 

We're all restricted to one rotation per six months, so in the event to where you'd be amazing for a role that maybe, just maybe might just wind up being able to hire you, too bad so sad. You're stuck in your regular job watching someone else advance who's been there a fraction of the time that you have simply because they were in the right place at the right time. To rub additional salt into the wound, we get emails on the rare occasion that someone is actually hired off of a rotation, as if the career site had anything to do with it. Even better, they've barely even worked at Apple, going from a retail role to just skipping right over you making six figures easy. Now, I assume they're an amazing person who is killing it, but I don't know. What I do know is that I never got the opportunity to present like this person did because of this stupid "one rotation every six months" rule. 

- Once every six months your schedule will most likely change, potentially upending your life. It's Apple, right. If they put out a request for people to work odd hours, they would still get a crazy amount of applicants, but for whatever reason, rather than hiring for a specific shift, we all get judged by our metrics. These are metrics that are impossible to perfect due to the nature of our job, so no matter how hard one might try to get perfect metrics so that in turn you get first pick of your schedule, it won't happen. So, you might work from 7am to 4 pm half the year, then 11 am to 8pm the other half. Maybe you need weekends off because you have kids who are enrolled in sports and you want to be there to support them. Too bad so sad if your metrics weren't good enough to get first pick. Whereas once you may have worked Monday thru Friday, now you work Saturday thru Wednesday, or have two random days off rather than consecutively. 

- You get hired for a specific job, then over time you literally take on the job of several other organizations. Let's say you get hired to assist Mac and iPhone customers. Cool - two products (though, these products include all of the built-in apps and services). You can become a master over these two things and get amazing feedback from all of your customers, i.e. excel in your role. Then, the org decides that they want to take on a completely new products because they want to merge your org with what once was a separate org for "reasons", and it happens again, and again, and again... and no - you aren't paid more because of it. Now, you're supporting Mac, iOS, lets say Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness +, the Apple TV, Apple TV+, Apple Vision Pro, Apple whatever, therefore you knowledge gets very diluted and you are overall a less helpful person who to a customer doesn't sound like you know what you're doing. 

On top of that, management can't help but want to shake things up for no good reason, so you're often moved around within the office space itself, and you're often moved around to different managers, or to managers that you previously already had, then got moved from, and are now back under. It's like they have nothing better to do, or some budget that they don't want to lose access to and moving us around "costs money" or something. You create this fantastic working relationship with those around you, helping each other out, getting to really know people, then BAM! you get moved. Sometimes you get to start over and really get to know a whole new group of people that are awesome, but sometimes you get sat next to some guy that doesn't shower, sleeps all day only to be woken up by a phone call before attempting to nap again, or are sat next to someone who has anger management issues and slams their hands against the desk because every single customer frustrates them, etc. No wonder they treat AppleCare like children - it can be a daycare sometimes. I don't know why they allow this kind of thing to continue. 

- Management doesn't care about you. Any time you bring up a legitimate issue, you have to set up a meeting for when they're available, which can be weeks later sometimes, only to be given some really politically correct, BS response where nothing happens. It's like everyone is just biding their time, waiting to retire or die, and no one wants to "rock the boat". They want to talk the talk, but not walk the walk.
Advice: Get rid of the "one rotation every six months" rule. Allow us to pursue growth and career advancement without restriction.
Pros: - The benefits (eyes and dental) are great. Healthcare was until covid, now they're terrible and reject as much as possible, but that could be all providers for all I know.
- Other employee benefits aside from healthcare are nice. 
- The campus is well maintained and nice
- The caffe has great food that is pretty inexpensive for what you get. 
- On campus gym (but it's getting more expensive for some reason)
- Discounts on Apple and third party products/ services
- Occasionally you'll get free swag. 
- Occasionally there are campus parties. Not so much since covid, and never as good as Cupertino.

Leaders don't have each others back and it can be difficult to lead others in environments that don't have cohesive leadership.

They offer no growth for WFH ( AHA - at home advisor) roles. 

Advice: The overwhelming responsibility placed on senior support without a raise that shows their worth is trash. Let go of Lisa, she’s horrible for the company. You don’t have to push people to show your the boss. No compassion whatsoever 
Pros: They care about customers ALWAYS 

Cons: Culture changed significantly during my time, for the worse. Employees valued less and less. Customer service standards not upheld. Reliable hard working employees not recognized. Difficult constantly changing working hours. Extra work loads on holidays and weekends.

Cons: long and hard hours with a lot of talking
Advice: None
Pros: it was a fun job and had to talk a lot

Cons: Leadership preaches how much they care about the wellbeing of their employees yet do absolutely nothing to show for it. Zero work life balance. At least in the location I work for, your requests (vacation, requested days off, sick time )when there is no threshold will be denied. They Will create agreements and retract them later on. 
Apple no longer invests in their employees development. Everything is now in front of a computer with very little hands on training.
Advice: Be human, empathetic, and seek to understand.

Advice: None
Pros: Learn a lot about the operating system

Cons: Very mid for career growth
Advice: None
Pros: Good company but just ok

Cons: It's retail and customer facing. Customers are going to make you upset, the store will always be busy, and you will be asked to put on a smile at all times. Also, there are many employees and finding a full-time role is rare. In my case, the store leader and senior manager were mediocre and they only cared about themselves and their little clique. It was condescending and also ironic that a "store leader" and "senior manager" who did not know how any of the products work can tell you that you need to improve performance when they cannot offer help themselves. They would just hide in their office and ignore the madness of the store, especially during peak hours on the weekend (part of the reason why we were always behind on appointments). Additionally, we would be required to put in PTO a month and half or two months before the actual date while they were always out on vacation. It was demeaning and obvious that they did not care about the overall happiness of their employees. 

Also, the worst feeling about working at this store location is that senior management did not promote from within, when the store had so many talented people who could lead this location to success. There were so many employees who spent years working here that were overlooked for leadership roles when they 100% deserved it. Instead, it would be common for leadership to hire externally and bring on people who had no tech savviness whatsoever. Again, it would feel demeaning to have an outside hire manager/lead try to rate your performance when they didn't even know how to use an iPhone.
Advice: Recognize the talent of your people, some have worked there for so many years and deserve the opportunity.
Pros: Great benefits &amp; coworkers were nice.

Cons: We are constantly told when there is a full time position we will revive the chance to apply, however there is never a position open. They have multiple employees working part time to cover a full time employees short shift.
Advice: Listen to your employees when they express they are burnt out. Do not make promises you cannot keep. If you have multiple workers telling you they cannot afford even their basic needs listen, if your employees are faking leave of absences to “to take a mental break” then something is very wrong with the company.

Cons: They've lost a lot of what makes Apple, Apple. Much more process based on other companies, and focusing on the "how" or "what," and forgetting the "why." I hope they bring it back around.
