Advice: None
Pros: Great teams, great people, wonderful leadership (for the most part) Opportunities to move around and cross train, promote, etc.

Cons: The pay was really below industry standard, the workload, at points, was insane, a lot of extra hours were needed to keep the head above water (which I wouldn't have minded if the pay was where it should be) In order to keep costs low many people are hired as externs so couldn't avail of many of the same benefits as other employees. Massive emphasis on cost saving exercises mean that it's impossible to get a rise (even when you're doing well at work) therefore experienced people tend to leave and are often replaced with graduates with little to no experience. Benefits are poor (no health insurance, have to buy your own coffee at a mark-up, no snacks, no social clubs, few nights out) - an unusual "bake or buy" syndicate which one person was selected to buy food for everyone in the office (not ideal the Friday before payday) I remember being told that being able to say you work for "Brand X" was one of the benefits of the job there - madness!
Advice: - Work on hiring talent and growing it - A relentless focus on the bottom line makes it feel like a constant race to the bottom

Pros: As one of the largest OEMs, VW has lots of experience in industry and also is also making transitions.

Cons: - Bureaucracy and hierarchical structures hindered effective decision-making and slowed down project execution. This red tape often led to frustration among employees, as they struggled to bring their ideas to fruition promptly. - Communication between different departments was not always seamless, and inter-departmental collaboration could have been improved. Siloed thinking occasionally hindered the flow of information, resulting in missed opportunities to leverage collective expertise effectively. - Lack of employee engagement in certain projects.

Pros: Volkwagen is a company that believes in improving people through learning and it also encourages graduates to take on leadership roles

Cons: It's a big ship that steers slowly, be prepared to bury some of your projects or things that you put work into. (You can utilize this in reducing your own stress while working, as you can guess after some time which things will never make it out of the drawing room) The "System Wolfsburg" is real. Be prepared for political games and network accordingly. Hard to get into a management position through the internal way. If you have the chance to enter management positions while coming from another employer take it.

Pros: Flexible work, high tech training

Cons: promotion opportunities within departments are limited, and true career development options remain in transferring to one of the VW Group's other entities outside of Beijing. There is a relatively high rotation of top management due to the VW Group philosophy of management rotation, which brings a certain amount of organizational instability and some limitation of developing organizational knowledge.
Advice: None
Pros: Volkswagen China Investment Co. Ltd (VCIC) is a good employer that provides good terms to employees. As in many companies in China, foreign employees might get better terms due to a more limited access to national supporting systems that are available to local employees. Such benefits can include housing reimbursement, children education reimbursement, comprehensive global medical insurance etc. Reimbursement amounts are based on the employee's personal grading and are set in the employment contract.

Advice: None
Pros: good working climate, good manager

Cons: Awful culture - there's a thin veneer of inclusivity here. And to a degree it's true - they don't care who you are or where you're from - you'll all be bullied just the same! I used to be a big VW fan, and when the opportunity came to work here it was like a dream come true - which then turned into a mental nightmare. Not only would I never step foot in the place again, but I'd recommend avoiding it. And I no longer buy the products they sell. If you enjoy stabbing people in the back then this is the place for you, but if you're human - avoid it like the plague!
Advice: I doubt very much they'd even listen. Perhaps the toxicity is middle management?? Maybe spend some time at the coal face and really get to know what's going on - if that's not beneath you? Action not false promises. You have a lot to do to earn the true of customers and employees - failure here will see the end of you, particularly as the likes of Tesla and the Chinese makers are taking big chunks out of you. People first!!
