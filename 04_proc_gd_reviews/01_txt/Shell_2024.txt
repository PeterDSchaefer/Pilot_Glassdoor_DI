Cons: Lackluster 401k Plan and leave
Advice: None
Pros: Good culture and great experience

Cons: Ultimately, the company's roots are in The Netherlands which is a very (characteristically, not politically) conservative culture. Shell is very slow to adapt to evolving cultural norms, preferring to watch and wait before making operational changes. As an example, Shell consistently ranks in the Top Five of supermajors but never #1 because it is too ponderous. Another example is the pension plan, which was growing at rates of 3-5% a year. While this is a conservative approach to ensure stability and consistency in future returns, it does not keep up with cost of living increases or inflation. This perspective is also reflected in work processes. It can be stifling to creative, enterpreneurial and / or ambitious personality types.
Advice: American management from CEOs down (currently the CEO of Shell in the US is a woman) have been terrific about doing their best to have the work culture reflect the country culture but they are limited by the Europeans. 
Pros: Shell offers very competitive pay and benefits, professional development opportunities and support through life events. It's a huge global company and they've encountered just about / prepared for every kind of situation an employee may experience. Misbehavior is not tolerated.

Cons: Workload seemed to keep increasing
DEI policies a bit aggressive (a few promotions due to diversity when not qualified), not out of control though
Advice: Be very careful when "consolidating" jobs. This will burn out the rockstar and leave the slackers in place if done improperly
Pros: Benefits
Stability
Support
Notoriety
Job mobility

Cons: the longer you stay the better benefits
Advice: None
Pros: very good benefits including pension, 401, health insurance etc

Cons: Because Shell is a global company, they try to apply standards and policies broadly and sometimes miss the mark locally. Not all policies are universally applicable in every country and even different parts of the US.
Advice: Shell has recently made a change in its Senior leadership. Having been one of the world's leader energy companies, they should try to get back to what made them competitive in the past. The recent shift to green energy seems to have been over played. 
Pros: Shell is an incredibly safe place to work and has multiple avenues for advancement when employees are willing to work outside of their normal roles and responsibilities. 

Shell's benefits have always been very competitive with their peers in the industry 

Shell is a "career" opportunity not only an employer.

Cons: None that I can think of

Cons: Cold in winter, not a lot of tips.
Advice: None
Pros: Outdoors, mostly nice people from town.

Cons: Low pay, rude customers are frequent
Advice: None
Pros: Good coworkers and decent management

Cons: As any large corporation, it is difficult to drive changes due to the bureocratic nature of a large multinational company. However, there are many supportive people within the organization that are willing to step in and help, collaborate, and pursue a common goal.
Advice: Projects can be scrapped out of nowhere, or with the frequent management changes. This means that if you've been investing most of your time in a project, and when the cyclical (4- or 5-year) rotation comes around for most positions, management will surely change (and probably even before the cycle happens), and the new manager might decide to continue or scrap the project and start a new one. Therefore, the lack of continuity can be a little demotivating.
Pros: Great benefits, from a generous 401(k) match, annual bonus, above average salary (in the industry), great health insurance (among the best that I've had with really low deductibles), pension, etc.

Cons: Slow decision making by upper management
Advice: None
Pros: The roles will challenge you to grow in your profession. The pay and benefits are great.

Cons: Complexity: Shell scripting can become complex, especially for handling intricate tasks or dealing with large codebases. Managing dependencies, error handling, and edge cases can add complexity to scripts.

Limited Graphical Interface: Shells primarily offer a text-based interface, which may not be as intuitive or visually appealing as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for certain tasks, especially for users accustomed to graphical environments.

Steep Learning Curve: Learning to use a shell effectively, especially for beginners, can have a steep learning curve. Understanding command syntax, shell scripting concepts, and mastering various utilities and commands may require significant time and effort.

Security Concerns: Shell scripts can introduce security vulnerabilities if not written carefully. Poorly constructed scripts may inadvertently expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to system resources.

Platform Differences: While shell scripts are often touted for their portability, there can still be differences between shell environments on different operating systems (e.g., differences between Bash on Linux and macOS). Ensuring scripts work consistently across platforms may require additional effort.

Debugging Challenges: Debugging shell scripts can be challenging, especially for complex scripts. Limited debugging tools compared to higher-level programming languages can make identifying and fixing errors more difficult.

Performance Overhead: Some shell scripts may have performance overhead compared to compiled languages or more optimized scripting languages like Python or Ruby, particularly for computationally intensive tasks or large-scale data processing.

Maintenance Overhead: As shell scripts grow in size and complexity, maintaining them can become challenging. Ensuring scripts remain up-to-date, adapting them to changes in the environment or requirements, and managing dependencies can all contribute to maintenance overhead.

Dependency on External Tools: Shell scripts often rely on external utilities and commands, which may vary in availability or behavior across different environments. Managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility can be a concern.

Limited Error Reporting: Error reporting in shell scripts may be less informative compared to higher-level languages, making it harder to diagnose and troubleshoot issues, especially for novice users.

Despite these drawbacks, shell scripting remains a powerful and widely used tool for system administration, automation, and other tasks. Understanding these limitations can help users make informed decisions about when to use shell scripts and when alternative approaches may be more appropriate.
Advice: None
Pros: Efficiency: Shell scripting allows for automating repetitive tasks, saving time and effort. Once scripts are created, they can be reused or scheduled to run at specific times.

Flexibility: Shells provide access to a wide range of utilities and commands, enabling users to perform various tasks like file manipulation, text processing, system administration, and more.

Customization: Users can customize their shell environment to suit their preferences and workflow. This includes configuring aliases, setting environment variables, and choosing from a variety of plugins and themes.

Portability: Shell scripts are typically platform-independent, meaning they can run on different operating systems with minimal modifications. This makes them versatile for deployment across various environments.

Integration: Shells can be integrated with other tools and languages, allowing for seamless interaction with external programs and APIs. This makes them valuable for system integration and orchestration tasks.

Accessibility: Shells provide a command-line interface, which can be more accessible for users who prefer text-based interactions or those working on remote servers without graphical interfaces.

Learning: Working in a shell environment helps users develop valuable skills in command-line usage, scripting, and system administration, which are highly sought after in many technical roles.

Community Support: Shells like Bash have a large user base and extensive documentation available online. This makes it easier to find help, tutorials, and resources for learning and troubleshooting.

Scalability: Shell scripts can be simple, one-liner commands or complex scripts handling intricate processes. This scalability makes them suitable for tasks of varying complexity.

Low Overhead: Shells typically have low resource requirements, making them lightweight and suitable for use on resource-constrained systems or in environments where efficiency is crucial.

Overall, working in a shell environment offers a powerful and versatile toolkit for managing systems, automating tasks, and interacting with computers in a streamlined and efficient manner.
