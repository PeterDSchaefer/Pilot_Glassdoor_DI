Cons: Lackluster 401k Plan and leave
Advice: None
Pros: Good culture and great experience

Cons: Ultimately, the company's roots are in The Netherlands which is a very (characteristically, not politically) conservative culture. Shell is very slow to adapt to evolving cultural norms, preferring to watch and wait before making operational changes. As an example, Shell consistently ranks in the Top Five of supermajors but never #1 because it is too ponderous. Another example is the pension plan, which was growing at rates of 3-5% a year. While this is a conservative approach to ensure stability and consistency in future returns, it does not keep up with cost of living increases or inflation. This perspective is also reflected in work processes. It can be stifling to creative, enterpreneurial and / or ambitious personality types.
Advice: American management from CEOs down (currently the CEO of Shell in the US is a woman) have been terrific about doing their best to have the work culture reflect the country culture but they are limited by the Europeans. 
Pros: Shell offers very competitive pay and benefits, professional development opportunities and support through life events. It's a huge global company and they've encountered just about / prepared for every kind of situation an employee may experience. Misbehavior is not tolerated.

Cons: Workload seemed to keep increasing
DEI policies a bit aggressive (a few promotions due to diversity when not qualified), not out of control though
Advice: Be very careful when "consolidating" jobs. This will burn out the rockstar and leave the slackers in place if done improperly
Pros: Benefits
Stability
Support
Notoriety
Job mobility

Cons: the longer you stay the better benefits
Advice: None
Pros: very good benefits including pension, 401, health insurance etc

Cons: Because Shell is a global company, they try to apply standards and policies broadly and sometimes miss the mark locally. Not all policies are universally applicable in every country and even different parts of the US.
Advice: Shell has recently made a change in its Senior leadership. Having been one of the world's leader energy companies, they should try to get back to what made them competitive in the past. The recent shift to green energy seems to have been over played. 
Pros: Shell is an incredibly safe place to work and has multiple avenues for advancement when employees are willing to work outside of their normal roles and responsibilities. 

Shell's benefits have always been very competitive with their peers in the industry 

Shell is a "career" opportunity not only an employer.

Cons: None that I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Great company to work for 

Cons: Reorg every 3-4 years
Some are bureaucratic
Advice: None

Advice: Make it easier for people to transfer across disciplines
Pros: Good work life balance
Challenging projects

Opportunities to work internationally

Advice: None
Pros: Overall good company to work for

Cons: Low pay
No breaks

Cons: Cold in winter, not a lot of tips.
Advice: None
Pros: Outdoors, mostly nice people from town.

Cons: Low pay, rude customers are frequent
Advice: None
Pros: Good coworkers and decent management

Cons: As any large corporation, it is difficult to drive changes due to the bureocratic nature of a large multinational company. However, there are many supportive people within the organization that are willing to step in and help, collaborate, and pursue a common goal.
Advice: Projects can be scrapped out of nowhere, or with the frequent management changes. This means that if you've been investing most of your time in a project, and when the cyclical (4- or 5-year) rotation comes around for most positions, management will surely change (and probably even before the cycle happens), and the new manager might decide to continue or scrap the project and start a new one. Therefore, the lack of continuity can be a little demotivating.
Pros: Great benefits, from a generous 401(k) match, annual bonus, above average salary (in the industry), great health insurance (among the best that I've had with really low deductibles), pension, etc.

Cons: Slow decision making by upper management
Advice: None
Pros: The roles will challenge you to grow in your profession. The pay and benefits are great.

Cons: The comfort they provide in job security and stability can be a blessing in disguise, sapping your motivation to drive value in the company and get promoted.
Advice: Stop promoting people based on internal politics and nepotism. 
Pros: Shell will train you well, give you plenty of chances to work abroad, and move within the company.

Pros: -Lots of data
-Company 401K contributions (10% of salary after 10 years)
-Perception outside of being “elite”

Cons: The company is massive, really hard to stand out.
Advice: None
Pros: Pay was pretty good, work was remote.

Cons: Not enough wall outlets to use my george foreman grill to make lunch.
Advice: Please add more wall outlets, as this is an employees home away from home. Changing tables need to be checked by maintenance to see if repairs are needed on the drop-down wall units. This will ensure no children will be in danger and it also doubles as my dining area and is quite inconvenient when half of it is hanging off of the wall.
Pros: It sounds gross but i have learned so much because you can hear everything that goes on conversation wise in a rest room. The amount of people that use their phones while in the stall is amazing. Sure, they may wash their hands but that poor phone is covered in waste.

Cons: If you’re on a team that has a bad manager then it is very frustrating and limiting both from a career development standpoint, a work life balance standpoint, and visibility standpoint (need to constantly show off what you’re doing and make it sound important and impactful)

Advice: None
Pros: My first company out of college, very relaxed and laid back, great work-life balance, work culture is amazing, people are lovely and supportive, great place to be.

Cons: The largest flaw I have experienced is by Shell placing leadership based on their education or outside experience. I recently received a poor IPF by a "new to Shell" manager because I did not lead like he led in the military. I achieved my goals and highest results in the department. Proved to HR and Employee Relations that I was discriminated against for not being like him. They recognized and acknowledged the unfair actions against me, but finally said 'HR does not have the ability to reverse the wrong done to you'. It cost me over 10k in my bonus, over $3,000 each year in my compounding salary and more in my pension when I retire. I received a punitive punishment based on confirmed discrimination and lack of diversity with zero desire for the business to make it right.
Advice: Treat your employees better! Be serious about discrimination (at all levels) and stop placing people in management because of their degree or military experience and give HR the power to 'right the wrongs' done in your organization. This protects management from discipline when they abuse frontline workers.
Pros: Great company, but like all they have their flaws.

Cons: Constant change seems to become more and more constant
Advice: None
Pros: There are challenging opportunities available

Cons: I wanted to move from New Orleans to Houston, and a team in Houston said they wanted me on their team. The New Orleans team blocked the move. If you want to advance your career or want a change, do it externally to Shell, don't let Shell hold you back. Poor work life balance, lots of after hours calls and a typical week is already 60 hours. Company continues to make this worse by laying people off. People are frequently promoted into roles they are not qualified for. This is frustrating when you have to teach senior people how to do their job, but also stressfill when it happens to you . Management of Change process is very cumbersome. Very poor software is used. Shell was very cowardly about oil and gas outlook in 2020. When oil was cheap and we should have been spending big money on maintenance and refurbishment, they focused on laying off employees. By the time "project reshape" was executed, gas was back to $80 per barrel.
Advice: The matrix style organization is taken a little too far... your junior employees need to work directly for a manager. Don't block moves... Upgrade IT infrastructure. Especially MOC and SAP.

Advice: None
Pros: Making strides with DE&amp;I. As a woman, I am generally happy working at Shell and have many male Allie’s too. The company is trying to be more gender and race diverse. It’s maybe slower than I’d like, but acknowledge that the larger the company the slower the change can be. I am constantly challenged and find my job very rewarding. I get to work on different projects so that keeps it interesting too. With the exception of one boss when I first started, I have had amazing and supportive bosses that are trying to help me be better at my job. The maternity and paternity leave policy is excellent too.

Cons: Several recent shifts in top-down decisions.
Advice: None
Pros: A strong culture that fosters career loyalty.

Cons: So much corporate politics and bureaucracy. Hard to get things done. Seems like there has been a "re-org" and layoffs every 2-3 years since 2015. Many high flying managers get shuffled around quickly and by the time they get to upper management, they haven't ever really stayed in any part of the business long enough to see all the cost cutting measures they took start to backfire. Continuous shift towards treating our projects and engineering/staff as a simple generic commodity that can be outsourced to shorter term contract workers, and HVEC (High Value Engineering Center) aka low cost places. IT and HR was completely gutted and outsourced, it's a nightmare now trying to get help from those support functions.
Advice: It's a dynamic industry, and some changes are anticipated, but be better about making plans and sticking to them. Otherwise employees won't put any faith in new plans each time they are rolled out. It's just "flavor of the month".
Pros: Pay is competitive for energy majors, being a European company they are a little more relaxed and better work life balance than what I've heard from others at US based energy majors. A big focus on safety and trying their best to do the right thing.

Cons: Slow, lots of processes that need to be approved before doing anything or using new tools
Advice: None
Pros: Very supportive from leadership and coworkers. Really care about your well being and will take care of you

Cons: Salaries especially for JG5 and JG4 (ex: associate engineer and engineer, respectively) are falling behind greater industry standards. Management refuses to compare with talent outside of O&amp;G, which happens to be where the best talent resides, while touting how much digitalization they want to achieve. It would take a minimum of 10 years to get to a competitive total compensation. We are losing young talent to tech where even remote pay will easily start 2 times higher than Shell's starting comp. People under 40 will leave for greener grass, creating a void of technical talent for years to come.
Advice: Shell being a large company has plenty of room for an employee to explore different career paths although a good sponsor or mentor is necessary to vouch for you. That being said, although the benefits package is still very solid, Shell needs to step up their cash/stock compensation game to recruit and retain talent, not just hoard cash for management. Too many times have middle managers walked away with 10 times the bonus of a lower employee that has worked equally as hard or harder. Making a (rather small) one-time adjustment on the bonus after not paying bonuses or raising base salaries the previous year while leadership continues to rake in millions is sending a terrible message to the supposed greatest asset of the company - the people.
Pros: Health (free annual exam with premium discounts, plus full coverage on cancer and cardiac-related illnesses) and relocation (sizeable lump sums with additional services) benefits are substantial. Pension is still available but the structure is not as good as it used to be. Various corporate discounts are available, particularly in Houston. Overall, a complex organization in a very complex industry that makes you appreciate the global drive for energy transition.

Cons: Career path heavily decided by organizational leadership
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits and stability given market volatility

Cons: disorganized, ever-changing, ups-and-downs. This may all be changing for the better (finger's crossed)

Cons: Getting the same locations over and over it would be nice if they switched it up with the people that have been here longer to allow the newcomers to get some of the easier stuff every now and then to have a early night
Advice: None
Pros: The pay is good you have every other weekend off at my location. Working nights can be a little difficult if you're not used to it lots of deliveries

Cons: Do not like sending to other assets or businesses
Advice: None
Pros: There’s room for growth in the company.

Cons: They don’t pay for your college even with a two year commitment after graduation. Low pay for the industry, little to no benefits 1/3 of your pay is taken for medical unless you get it somewhere else. They will work you into the ground. Don’t get hurt here or you will get fired on the spot.
Advice: You have a lot of work to do to keep the doors open, but enjoy your bonuses you take to make sure your employees get less.

Cons: Less Pay Bad Leadership Not much opportunities to look for

Pros: Great Work Life Balance Flexible Work Schedule Transparent Work Culture

Cons: Shell needs to evolve and change as it makes its into the 21st century. I believe it'll be around for a while as it'll play a critical role in the energy transition. The scale of that role highly depends on a few things: 1) cease juggling many things all at once (anecdote: you're required to have 8 goals a year), 2) strict financial discipline, many many projects have negative value and fuzzy strategic value at best.
Advice: None

Pros: A self-managing problem solver would have a blast working here. Every day is different and challenging. The people are fun and smart. It used to have a fun startup atmosphere when Scott Mercer was CEO. (We are now moving toward a corporate feel after Shell acquisition… however, I am reserving judgement until fully integrated)

Cons: There are no cons working here
Advice: None
Pros: Very nice organization to work for.

Cons: - 5+ years ago Shell jobs were dynamic and fulfilling, but HR transformation has led to less exciting roles. Roles are challenging but mostly due to complicated stakeholder management. Now business partnering jobs will take much longer to reach unless you're identified as high potential. I think many other companies may also be headed in this direction unfortunately.
- Work/life balance is promoted but going beyond is valued and recognized. That coupled with job insecurity due to frequent reorganization leads to lots of people getting burned out to avoid making mistakes or being laid off. It can also sometimes lead to people shifting responsibility/blame to other people or CoEs to save face.
Advice: - 9/80s won't be enough to keep people forever (especially if people end up working on their days off anyway), and comp/benefits are becoming less competitive with the growing tech industry.
- Be cognizant of office politics that exist and keep working to make people feel safe going against the grain.
Pros: - Some employees are truly wonderful and genuine people and coworkers can become like family. 
- Flexible hours, and 9/80s are hard to beat.
- Great bonuses when business is performing well.
- Lots of passion around D&amp;I, great affinity groups.
- As far as big players in the industry go, Shell does seem to be trying hard to transform itself and move towards being more environmentally-friendly.

Advice: Starting pay should go by experience. I can't live on what I make. No one can. I shouldn't have to ask for a raise. If my work is good, better than, I should be compensated appropriately. That's the reason employees have left. And I think why it's so hard to get new employees.

Advice: None
Pros: Shell has a great people culture, diversity is very important, if desired you can have a life long career, and pay &amp; benefits are great.

Cons: Boredom is tantamount, as it is almost never busy.  The worst thing to deal with is a lack of respect from employers. I am often told to do the work of other employees, do things not in my job description, and work inconsistent schedules. Although the manager has a perfect schedule with an extra hour of overtime added every day, no one else is promised even the normal amount of full-time hours. Boss collects overtime while all other employees work whatever hours they're given because apparently the business can barely afford it.
Advice: Stop stealing hours from the employees to collect over time, especially when the business "cant afford to give us overtime."

Cons: Work is not merit-based, Promotions and Perks are all based on politics. Even if one politically significant person dislikes you, you are limited. And the dislike does not have to be substantiated. Set low expectations for your employment. At least you'll earn average pay while working as a servant. That's typical for most of the people who work here.

The work environment is based on the oil price: a high oil price means a normal work environment, low price means you can be fired tomorrow. So be on alert.
Advice: None
Pros: Compensation is average. You can definitely get the same in other places.

Pros: Pay and benefits were great.

Cons: Can be very cyclical depending on your line of business (downsizing), mentorship is often lacking for career progression, slow to react to recommended changes.

Cons: Deal with a lot of weirdos
Advice: None
Pros: Easy, dont have to do much

Cons: Franchise owner cheap; no raises, promotions, Sapphire POS ancient need updated one
Advice: Reward hard working employees raises, promotions, do performance reviews of CSR's yearly as a tool to improve our skills/work habits, policies, ect. Replace old POS so we can process sales more efficiently, quicker! Less mistakes = less $$ / time loss; from entry level all the way to management & franchise owners! How can CSR's do an efficient, speedy job if their equipment is sub-par? Customers don't care (how some employees can get stressed, frustrated, even act rudely to them because) the registers, gas pumps, or fountain stations don't operate correctly! They'll take their business & hard earned money somewhere else!  And I don't blame them one bit!! I would too! So l just ask for discussion & thought to how some major issues in retail stores can be solved with the ideas I mentioned above. When I have a great day at work, my customers see it  on my face & hear it in my voice! My goal: make each customer happier than when they first came into our store! Go the extra step to help customers, co-workers! TEAM EFFORT!! Needs to be implemented hands on!! COSTCO policy is great example of better work environment creating positive results in many different levels of retail businesses! Circle K stores also have a few programs where hard work is recognized, rewarded & encouraged! I take pride in my job & work hard every day!! I hope I am setting an example for my co-workers, customers and most of all my 2 sons! Thank you & have a wonderful day! :-)

Pros: Salary is good. People is good

Cons: There is a lack of diversity.
Advice: N/A
Pros: It was just ok. No big pros.

Cons: people really don't care, and they get away with not caring.  it's all about maintaining a facade of professionalism when in fact you're taking 2-hour lunches, leaving work early, and relying on the consensus-driven culture to shrug off any blame when deadlines aren't met.  promotions are seniority-based, not merit-based, so you have to wait a while if you want to have influence.  Americans don't get to work internationally.  the jet-setter lifestyles are more reserved for the Europeans.
Advice: reward people on a more immediate scale and more heavily for high contributions.  being told you're 20% more productive than average is great to hear, but if it doesn't result in a salary boost or more influence, it loses its meaning.  putting in 60 hours per week for a high five and an extra couple thousand dollars at the end of the year is not worth it to the average employee, when the alternative is to sit on your hands and yawn through the 40 hour work week.
Pros: great salary and benefits and absolutely fantastic work-life balance.  work 80 hours every two weeks with every other Friday off (called 9-80 schedule).  salary boost of ~5% every 6 months.  some travel for training.  there are some really good people in the younger crowd, but the general apathy pulls them down (see below).  outside of downstream, people are international and tolerant.  worked with people from different countries with different religions and cultures.

Cons: 401k matching is low for the industry - especially for experienced hires.

Due to the management structure and corporate culture, one may at times feel that too much emphasis is placed on bending over backwards to perform inconsequential tasks and to drop much more meaningful tasks in order to do so.  Typically this will be a simple mandate from above which leads to each subordinate level of management scrambling simply in order to please their superiors.

There is also a tendency within Shell for various types of meetings to be presented as optional but for which management will deem "strongly suggested."  Management seems mold words to their agendas as these strongly suggested meetings are optional on paper but in attitude are quite mandatory.  Mandatory meetings are not a problem but honesty and decency demands that you call them such.
Advice: Disclaimer:  My opinion may not necessarily reflect upon managers pertinent to my current role.  As of today I've worked at Shell for 13 1/2 years.

Most Shell managers are quite well placed in their roles.  I am satisfied and happy at Shell.  That being said, the culture set from the top down needs to be adjusted to be a bit more open and less secretive.  Senior management means well but execution can often be lacking.
Pros: Shell has a wonderful and extensive set of benefits.  Additionally, Shell pays out good and fair salaries as well as incentivized performance bonuses and service recognition awards.

Finally, Shell places a respectable focus on career development and employee well being.

Cons: Salary package that is not the best in class
Advice: None
Pros: Collaboration between team member and cross fuctiom

Cons: Shell often hires you for one job, but ends up giving you another job.  Often it is outside what you have been trained for or have experience in.  Every year you are "evaluated" against your peers and the lowest evaluated employees are "put on notice" that they must improve or will be let go.  The problem with this "evaluation" is that you are compared with all employees worldwide who have been evaluated by their immediate Manager.  All "evaluations" are sent to HR and then people who do not even know you or your work performance are determining your future with Shell.  Shell uses this method of Forced Ranking to get rid of employees and hire less experienced employees to keep costs down.
Also there is little or no communication between upper management and the employees.  HR does not handle complaints for the employee but only for upper management.  The HR representatives I have witnessed who took complaints from my fellow coworkers did nothing to help the worker but suddenly our immediate supervisor knew everything about the complaint.  It does no good to go the HR with any employee complaints because the employee will suddenly have poor "evaluations".
Advice: Listen to your employees and eliminate the use of Forced Ranking for Employee Performance.
Pros: Shell offers great opportunites for recent graduates.  They can get the necessary experience on the career ladder to pursue a more satisfying opportunity at another major corporation that will respect the individual worker.

Cons: Working at Shell may be challenging due to travel requirements.
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Colleagues are top notch and team oriented

Cons: technical challenges and work place
Advice: treat your employees right and with respect
Pros: pay and respect, working hours

Cons: Shell continues to reorganize, eliminating high pay positions and putting more responsibility on lower grade levels.  The department that I work in has reorganized every year for the past 3 years.   There are now 54% less people and the majority left have less than 4 years experience.  

Work/ Life balance is poor.  Since there are less people, there is more overtime work.  Folks are scared to provide honest feedback to management since they may be eliminated during the next reorganization.

Beware that there are some people who get away with back-stabbing to advance their careers.  Everyone is ranked against each other for bonuses and advancement.
Advice: Eliminating people, especially the high paid experienced ones, does quickly reduce costs and increase the stock price.  However, this is not a long-term sustainable strategy.  Instead try eliminate unnecessary work and streamlining processes to get the most out of folks.   Also, promote people based on their abilities and not their ethnicity or gender.
Pros: Large company with potential to move to other positions and areas

Flexible working schedule.  Still offer 9/80 (work 9 hours M-R, 8 hours every other Friday).  Still offer flexible starting times.  

People are nice and work in a team environment.  

Still provide free coffee (regular and decaf)

Cafeteria has great food

Cons: Sometimes, Shell can feel "too big," as you always seem to find a new business in Shell that you hadn't heard of no matter how long you're in the company. It's exciting, but can make it really confusing what Shell really is doing. For example - we have a digitalization and blockchain team as well as a team that works with clean tech start-ups, but it took me two years to find out these existed. I think Shell could do better at sharing, both internally and externally, what they do in the up-and-coming spaces.
Advice: Covered in the cons
Pros: I just finished a role in technical safety engineering and I really enjoyed working with my team. At first, I came into the corporate Shell office feeling like everyone was "too nice," as if people were playing the corporate ladder game like TV would suggest. However, I realized Shell tends to hire pretty genuinely nice people - when I was feeling ill one day, my boss encouraged me to take a break and head home to rest and was very lenient on me when I needed to catch up in the next week. The job was technically challenging, but the team really helped me learn and become independent as an engineer. I also had the chance to work on projects on the side that relate to emissions reduction and clean energy through one of the employee networks, and my line was quite supportive of me spending time learning about topics that interested me during my "development time."

Cons: Workload management is difficult at times

Cons: Upward movement can be slow.
Advice: None
Pros: Many opportunities and great culture.

Cons: Very large company.  Can be hard to navigate such a large structure.
Not American owned.  Dutch owned and consequently there is always a tension between global processes and local needs and laws to be overcome.  Global can mean a loss of personal identity in the larger scheme of things and can also offer complications, especially with hiring laws, environmental laws and overall product quality.
No real say as to who is placed in Sr. Leadership.  Employees are never asked about changes in leadership and tend to be the last to know something that huge is changing within the company structure.
Advice: Listen to the questions that employees are asking and actually answer the question or bring someone with you who can give a reasonable answer.
Pros: Ease of communication with immediate management.  Shell has a very strict open door policy for its employees.
Ability to seek and receive training in personal development as well as critical business skills.  Shell offers a learning center to its employees called the Shell Open University where outside consultants come in to educate employees and help to keep their skills sharp.
Great compensation and benefits.  Shell offers one of the best salary and benefits packages in the industry.
Good personal feedback both as an individual and as a team.  Shell is very good about asking for 360 feedback.
Plenty of intellectual challenges offered.  Shell offers projects that are stimulating and very rewarding.
Great personal achievement recognition awards.  Shell offers great monetary awards for outstanding work.

Cons: No phones 
Low pay for graveyard
Advice: None
Pros: Easy work for a cashier

Cons: nothing to complain about, nice place to work
Advice: None
Pros: Great and caring working culture

Cons: I could not think of any.
Advice: None
Pros: Safety is top priority. 
Work-life balance.

Cons: No bonus because they are subjective based on how the company performs. 

The worst work/life balance I had ever experience. They "give" you every other Friday off, however, you better be online working or else you will fall behind. I would find myself working sometimes until midnight during the week to keep up with work. At times, I would work on the weekends to stay up to date and would notice my coworkers and cross-functional teams would be doing the same as they would be "online" via skype. Shell used skype (like many use Zoom) for you to show your online status (offline, away, in a meeting, etc.). Managers would use your online status to gauge how "good" of an employee you were. I was warned/counseled by my upper management because they noticed my online status had been "away" 3 times in a day for 20 mins each time and to them that was unacceptable. Diversity and Inclusion is not a top priority. If your last name did not start with "Van something" or you are not Dutch, forget about climbing the corporate ladder there. Dealt with 5 reorganizations in two years, which means it is very unstable and many people kept getting laid off.
Advice: Stop walking around the floors like you are some big shot and humble yourselves.
Pros: Worked at Shell in Woodcreek in Houston, TX. The only thing that was worth about working for Shell oil sector was the pay. Eventhough I never received a bonus.

Cons: Bureaucratic and very consensus orientation slowinh progress.
Advice: None
Pros: Great compensation and benefits with great coworkers.

Cons: politics was often very frustrating
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, people centric in most cases

Cons: Not much learning opportunities in Shell
Advice: None
Pros: Good for starting your career

Cons: Creeps and homeless ppl doing weird stuff
Advice: None
Pros: Very fast pace meet new ppl

Cons: Nothing bad here. All's good
Advice: None
Pros: Good place to work and settle down

Cons: Must work to stay above the crowd.
Advice: None
Pros: Intelligent people are the norm there!

Cons: no bad review from me for now
Advice: None
Pros: very very very good man

Cons: Notorious for HR overreach; important personnel decisions that should be left to management end up in the hands of young and inexperienced HR staff.  There is a problematic tendency to over-staff teams during good years (I would estimate 10:1), then go through protracted re-organizations when the price of oil falls.  That said, Shell is a big company, and "upstream" is not representative of the whole.  From what I could tell, many of the core-business upstream and most of the downstream folks all seemed to really love their jobs.
Advice: Don't underestimate the psychological impact of the frequent re-orgs, particularly when your people may have to wait 6+ months for a decision.  Adding that degree of uncertainty to your employee's lives can create a huge amount of unneccesary stress, and professionals tend to conceal it so well that you might not ever know.  I would also consider filling some/more HR jobs as ~2 year assignments for mid- to senior-level technical workers, with the expectation that they will mentor the younger HR staff.
Pros: The salary is fantastic!  I always felt like they rewarded me well for my hard work and extra effort in terms of bonus and stock award.  Very generous with vacation, with option to purchase an extra week each year.  You will do very well if pay and benefits are your highest priority.  The re-orgs can be a little bit intimidating, but if you do your job well, you will be safe.

Cons: Job security (some of my colleagues left due to Reshape)
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay and benefits
Friendly environment

Cons: Hot temperature in Qatar, when Humid
Advice: None
Pros: Good Accommodation, nice country and city

Cons: Can be slow to make decisions
Advice: Keep up the good work. Shell employees have a lot of pride in the name
Pros: Great culture. Really respectful management

Cons: Geez so many... Every month, someone quits. Wonder why... The company claims they love diversity but hires everyone from the same city, same school. Pretty much everyone has lived near the site for their whole lives. How will you ever be innovative???? All your employees are too closed minded to every leave the country or even state. Horrible and long work hours, even weekends sometimes but they act like they care about preventing fatigue. You’ll never see management there on weekends though. Mainly white males with egos through the ROOF. I’m a white male and even I hated this. I’d never grow there. Everyone makes fun of each other plus talks behind each other’s backs, and smiles in faces, even management. Everyone tries to push work on someone else. This place was full of lazy stuck up people, just going through the motions. You’re only liked by managers if you kiss up. Oh and don’t ever be quiet. Quiet people will never ever ever make it. 

The systems are extremely slow. They keep cutting the budget & just laid off all of hr??? Takes way to long to move around. Plus so much more. Spare yourself and don’t work here. It’s probably the whole refining industry.
Advice: Actual diversity can solve a lot of this. I realize the company started hiring only all white males and now you are trying to reverse it, but honestly may be too late. This place is horrible, especially to young people who are increasingly growing up to value diversity & innovation highly.
Pros: High pay. You will learn to navigate & be tough in stressful environments. Free food at least 2x/week. That’s really it.

Cons: THey're a dinosaur when it comes to futureproofing ... they want people in the office which is so dumb.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay. Advancement isn't truly a meritocracy. A lot of talent just gets the 'hall pass' of favoritism and they're catapulted to the top.

Cons: Slow in decision making; company in transition process creates less efficiency.
Advice: None
Pros: Treat people well, good work environment, and people relationship

Cons: Bad management and bad supervisor
Advice: Please pay attention to employees needs and concerns

bad manager
bad attitude

terrible staff reports
Advice: None
Pros: good ethics
good moral
good work
good employment
good environment

Cons: Organization is generally slow in terms of making decisions and very process heavy in just about everything. Sometimes simple projects approvals / decisions are difficult to obtain.
Advice: None
Pros: The company has a global presence so there are opportunities to work in other parts of the world, if that is appealing to you. 

The company is healthy despite the struggles of the oil and gas industry globally. 

The company has a healthy culture in terms of general respect for employees (disrespectful interaction and abusive interactions are generally frowned upon), family and work/life balance is important, increased cultural diversity seems to be a focus.  

General safety in all respects is VERY important.  The company spends a significant amount of time and money preaching safety in everything that is done. While this is no new or surprising for a terminal, off-shore, work operation in the field, the same laser focus takes place in the office buildings with all employees- accountants, finance, secretaries, etc.  For instance, if one is walking down a set of stairs, you are required to hold the handrail. If you don’t and someone sees you, then the may say (politely), “Please use the hand rail”). The idea is to keep people safe at all costs and creat a culture throughput the organization where safety is more important than profits and “efficiency”.

Cons: Low pay, low mobility, enormous workload, short-staffed, poor training, rude clientele.
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible hours, kind and understanding managers

Cons: Strong engagement with many stakeholders (sometimes too many) needed to deliver project and really impact the business.

Advice: None
Pros: flexible schedule, great benefit and great work environment

Cons: When it became holiday season and I was selling 4-5 times as much merchandise than any other time...then it became chaos. Tried to request a second employee for certain shifts at least a couple of days a week and they refused. Was working overtime and not getting paid for it. I ended up leaving after a manager yelled at me in front of customers that nobody "REALLY" cares about my wellbeing and that I was supposed to be closed off and fake to people in order to make more money.
Advice: Listen to your valuable employees who've been there for years when they tell you that they cannot physically handle the job alone during holidays and I'm pretty sure it's ILLEGAL to not pay someone for any hours over 40 in 7 consecutive days!
Pros: I loved everything about the job as far as the work and customers.but when it became holiday season and I was selling 4-5 times as much merchandise than any other time...then it became chaos. Tried to request a second employee for certain shifts at least a couple of days a week and they refused. Was working overtime and not getting paid for it.

Advice: None
Pros: Best firm , appreciate the environment

Cons: Repeditive, salary was rough, retail enviroment, toxic / negative employees common.
Advice: None
Pros: Routine work, great management, meeting lots of people often.

Cons: This is a company for and run by graduates. Now graduates are species that are born in shell and die in shell ,because nobody outside takes them. If you are capable then please dont stay here for long else u will rust. Here they have copied all the nice things from other companies like "feel free to speak your mind" but if you do you will be tortured. 
Because the company runs on the philosophy steal with pride which means if you are an innovator they will steal your idea and dump you in garbage. 
Beacuse people have stayed here for so long they have no idea about ways of working in the market that even when senior people from outside are hired thier thinking ability  is killed. Infact the company is struggling to implement workday its been years and leaders only extend deadline. I guess workday should publish a case study on shell for how long it is taking and there are many examples. 
The europeans treat employees  like slaves ..they do this very smartly...so your existance in shell depends on your counties passport...lol. 

Oh my god ..i spend some of the worst years of my career here thank god i am out of this silent hell called shell.
Advice: Please hire some senior members from the industry else this company is on its way to hell
Pros: If you career is going nowhere and you need good money for doing nothing then this is the best place. If you are a yes man never oppose to anything are manupulative highly political with an agenda...boy you have a great career at shell

Cons: Requires long hours most times
Advice: None
Pros: Great to be part of a Fortune 500

Cons: You will be in uncomfortable situations with customers and you will need to learn how to deal with it. You can't make everyone happy.
Advice: n/a
Pros: Great place to improve your soft skills, such as communication.

Cons: Bad leadership, fewer and fewer progression opportunities, wasteful business practices
Advice: Fire half of management, get better leaders, focus on diversity of thought
Pros: Lots of opportunities to coast in positions

Cons: Good but can be better
Advice: None
Pros: Good to work there full time

Cons: not much room for upward movement
not much communication from management
Advice: communicate with your employees
Pros: pay is good for a teen
not difficult work

Cons: Nothing major from me here -- cons are very dependent on personality and fit within Shell's strong corporate culture.  If you are not proactive about establishing a network, it can be difficult to get things done.  Networking is very important in this large company as it is hard to stand out with the large amount of intelligent individuals in Shell.
Advice: Shell seems to be on the right track to becoming a more competitive organization.  Thank you for treating employees with respect during the re-organizations.  The openness and long timelines creates stress for the organization, but is very helpful for those who are impacted in that they can plan for the future and say farewell to their colleagues and friends.
Pros: Excellent growth and development for younger staff.  Opportunities are available for those who are willing to work hard and distinguish themselves.  Large companies mean that there is always an opportunity somewhere.  Excellent compensation and company is supportive of work life balance.  Balance is key, sometimes business needs dictate that you need to work extra, sometimes life situations such as family emergencies, child births and health issues lead to situations where employees need support.  I have always found Shell very supportive during challenging life situations.

Cons: Very defined line between contractors vs direct hire employees. Expect to be a "work horse" as a contractor, with no acknowledgement or reward other than being allowed to enter the building the next day. Management couldn't care less if you stay or leave.
Advice: Take more notice in the ENTIRE team. Contractors know that they are contractors. That does not mean you have to treat them as less than when it comes to opinions, changes in job positions, etc. Treating your ENTIRE team with respect and making EVERYONE feel that they are contributing to the groups success makes for a better work environment, less turn over, and most importantly, falls in line with the Shell values of integrity and respect.
Pros: As a Contractor - Learn quickly in short period of time b/c you either sink or swim. The ability to put Shell on your resume....does wonders. You have the opportunity to make many connections throughout Shell. As an Employee - great pay, benefits, etc. Overall, I think Shell is a great company for its direct employees. As a contractor you have to go in with the mindset that it is a tremendous stepping stone to greater opportunities.

Cons: No help it is a joke
Advice: None
Pros: There is nothing good about it

Cons: Terrible management dosent work with you on days you cant work
Advice: None
Pros: Not much to say lol

Cons: - Not the cleanest place to work at, despite having to vigorously clean it daily.
- During the day it is no longer laid back and can actually become busy to the point of stressful at it's worst.
- Cigarette and lottery ticket count at the start and end of every single shift becomes mind numbing very quickly.
- Nearly every single consumable item in the store is terrible for you.
- You have to watch waves of people all day long buying and consuming aforementioned terrible food. It gets depressing after a while.
- You can be tasked with working the fridge and freezer on a whim even if you aren't prepared for the cold (like not having a coat) and have to spend prolonged periods of time in them.
- Gas station hot dogs are disgusting.
Advice: Don't be so shy about considering a pay raise for someone that genuinely does a really good job and is committed to excellence within a kingdom of filth and disappointment. You will be less likely to lose them later on.
Pros: - Fairly laid back during overnight shifts.
- The job itself really isn't difficult at all.
- Meet a colorful array of customer personalities.
- One free hot dog per shift.

Cons: Promises made about career development and opportunities aren't honored. Lower graded staff (grade 4 and below) are ignored. Company does a really good job making it seem attractive and competitive to candidates but once you are there you can forget about what you were told.   If you are a minority then you might get more focus but otherwise don't expect much. Join the company and get a few years experience under your belt and go to someplace where talent and hard work are appreciated over gender and skin color. If you are a minority, exploit the company's HR processes and make a good career for yourself.
Advice: SDevelop a well communicated and thought out  business plan. Stop tying up billions of dollars in failed projects and pull out of countries where the risks and exposure are greater than the returns.  Develop an executive team that can do a better job of predicting the economic and political uncertainties since the past 15 year track record is laughable. Give time for changes to embed and prove themselves effective (or ineffective) before you make more changes.
Pros: Good pay and good benefits.

Cons: I believe that the company would benefit a great deal from setting up internal committees or advisory boards made up from employees across all levels to add value in real business challenges. Also, i believe the employer brand should better match the working conditions and the career development that is offered. There is a perception that a career with Shell automatically means international travel, that is not always the case and this can cause disengagement amongst the employees. A fair and honest description would be far better and would be seen as a great attraction point once employees get this.
Advice: Listen to the workforce more
Pros: They have a great brand that attracted me to the organization, however the reality doesn't really stack up to the dream that was sold. I believe that the company would benefit a great deal from setting up internal committees or advisory boards made up from employees across all levels to add value in real business challenges. Also, i believe the employer brand should better match the working conditions and the career development that is offered. There is a perception that a career with Shell automatically means international travel, that is not always the case and this can cause disengagement amongst the employees.

Cons: More of an investment bank than an oil company.  Science and engineering are subordinated to financial wants.  Training focussed on developing those who want to be a polished, powdered courtiers.  Innovation and creative thinking encouraged so long as it conforms to a global standard that everyone agrees on, and fits within the bureaucracy.  Recruit,recognize and promotes attractive,clever and tractable  people.  Actively discourages passionate, focussed problem solvers.
Advice: A company of grifters.  Careers advance  on promises.  Encourages "kicking the can down the road" for difficult problems, passing them on to successors.  Do enough to buy time before transferring elsewhere.  The individuals responsible for developing new technology are also in a position to enforce its use as a gatekeeper for projects.  Middle managers 
are unprepared to execute projects and make the bureaucracy work at the same time.  The focus on cleverness and tractability implies a lack of integrity.  The pattern of making  big promises, then "manage expectations" permeates the organization.  The company recognizes the brokering of information and technology rather than its development.
Pros: Opportunity to work in a high-tech environment with exposure to emerging technologies, social issues, and multiple cultures.

Cons: We have to stay in a job for four years, before we can move to the next role.  Of, course a reorg will occur at some point during that 4 years which may enable you to move to a different role.
Advice: Continue to care for your staff.  Shell holds the loyalty of its staff because of the care.  We are not a number, like one of the other majors treat their employees as.
Pros: Shell cares for and supports the people of Shell.  We're not just a number.  In every meeting, we hold a safety moment, sharing something that can make us safer at work, on the road and at home. 

Shell hires the best people... People you will know and respect and enjoy for the rest of your life.  No matter the work you do in Shell, you will generally find good people to work with.  When times get tough, deadlines need to be made, another change initiative comes through, it's you colleagues that get you through.  Your a team.  You grow stronger with each other to deliver high quality product.

Cons: Most of the IT staff is in India. If you're in the US, 5:00 and 6:00 AM meetings are not unusual (but not really common). If you're in India, expect to be on calls after 7 with US staff. You may not be on the same continent with the rest of your team or your lead or your manager.

It's still a consensus-based culture, and I'd like to see more managers able to make the tough decision and move forward, even if not everyone agrees. It still feels like it takes too long for anything to happen.

Weekly 1-on-1s with your supervisor are not part of the culture.
Advice: Require everyone's annual performance goals to be measurable and have a time component. All of the GPAs I saw (in IT) up the line had at least a couple vaguely defined goals that were written so that there was no way to be accountable for not achieving the goal.
Pros: Lots of talented people to work with. Lots of challenging projects. 

Wonderful pay and benefits; they are targeted at the 75th percentile. The company is extremely concerned about your health &amp; safety and work-life balance. The full package here is practically unbeatable.

Cons: Don't work here ever ever
Advice: You suck
Pros: Weekly pay free soda meet cool people

Cons: slow to adopt company standards such as work from home
Advice: None
Pros: great pay, great people, great culture

Cons: Not a lot of cons even for a large multi-national petroleum company with 93,000 employees worldwide.
As Shell is a foreign owned company, a lot of the preference goes to employees already oversees, or that work oversees frequently and build the familiarity with the decision makers in UK & Netherlands
Advice: Keep communicating with the divisions - not just in teleconferences and webinars, but face to face - get to know the people on "the other side of the pond". I was fortunate to have Sr Management that did that, but other colleagues of mine in other groups were not as fortunate.
Pros: Shell has a lot of opportunities to move your career in any direction you want, but you have to make your own contacts and plan ahead to move in to another position. As I Was getting my bachelors degree in another field of study than what I was employed in, I Was told I would need to quit Shell and work elsewhere after I got my degree. I remained at Shell for another 16 years after receiving my Bachelors in MIS but I had to acquire interviews as a new college hire through my university (I was already a 13 yr employee at Shell by then) - unconventional method but it worked.

Cons: Fast paced
Toxic work environment
Management that chose favorites
Advice: None
Pros: Pay is alright
Variety of things to do

Cons: Sold us without giving us a heads up. Screwing many folks out of their pension.
Advice: None
Pros: No pros whatsoever. They care more about diversity than actually performing well.

Cons: Rude Manager 
Get Robbed Constantly
Advice: None
Pros: Nice Customers 
No Direct Deposit 
Free Hot Dogs

Cons: the work sucks a lot
Advice: None
Pros: the schedule is very flexible

Cons: the corporate structure get old quit
Advice: None
Pros: the jobs has good benefits

Cons: The organization is HUGE! It takes about a year to even understand the depth of the business and various projects. Because of its size, it can be a long career before you are able to take on bigger pieces of the business or into management, but it is a great company to get many experiences.

The company has a reputation for having issues controlling cost, but the investors are pushing for greater control. Positive changes have been happening to get a handle on it.
Advice: None
Pros: I worked for Shell for almost a decade in a professional corporate function based in Houston. Overall, I really respect the company culture, the amazing people and how the company manages people. The Dutch influence has made the "respect for people" aspect of HR quite pervasive. They actually walk the talk. In Shell, you have a great degree of control over your career path. They post jobs internally and you are able to raise your hand for advancement if you are ready. I left Shell for personal reasons, but it was a difficult decision to leave the people that I met while at Shell. I would go back to Shell if my circumstances changed.  

Benefits package is top notch
The 9/80 schedule was great way to manage work/life balance.

Cons: Extremely inflexible and bureaucratic. Nothing happens quickly in Shell, and the inefficiency is costing them.

Very rigid job roles - you are a cog in a machine. People will sometimes get angry (to an unprofessional degree) if you push into their territory, even if it's better for the company.  New ideas are not welcome.

"Reorganizations" every couple years of departments (and in 2009 the entire company!) keep the efficiency low and lead to a constant anxiety about job security.

Worst of all, the Peter Principle is hard at work in Shell.  At the lower levels, people are sometimes promoted based on their past technical performance and not on their ability to manage people.

All in all, a Millennial's worst nightmare of an employer. Retention rates of new hires are very low.
Advice: Your messages and plans are falling on deaf ears.  The answer is less bureaucracy, not more.  You have immense quantities of talent leaving the company because they're not being utilized or appreciated.
Pros: Great pay, great benefits, and decent work/life balance.  For a baby boomer, it's a dream company.  Also, since it's at the top of the food chain, just about any company will hire you with Shell experience on your resume.

Cons: They don't offer over time.
Advice: I would suggest  their starting out wages.
Pros: They treat you like family.

Cons: I cannot think of any :)
Advice: None
Pros: Devirse and really into safety culture

Cons: Bad management
No care for professional development

Cons: Even the managers don't know how to do their jobs. And they are quick to discriminate against you.
Advice: be more companionate, show empathy for your fellow human being.
Pros: There are no pros to working with this company.

Cons: Opportunities not equal amongst peers

Cons: a good employer to be necessary.
Advice: be kind
Pros: i am so interested in my field.

Cons: Big company and can have complex processed
Advice: None
Pros: Staff development and opportunities for growth

Cons: Initiative over-load; spent more that half of my time in useless meetings -- did not have enough time to get real work done.
Advice: Despite the cuts, it is still too top heavy
Pros: Very tolerant and respectful culture

Cons: Typical corporate culture of taking a while to get things done, nothing bad though.
Advice: None
Pros: I got placed in the Retail organization and loved it. Lots of emphasis on growth, learning and improvement. Love Shell, they really care about you as an employee. Definitely recommend!!

Cons: It's easy to get into a pay band that doesn't include any physical peers, making it difficult to compare or see what your "competition" is like.  Pay bands appear to be a little low and technical promotions slow.  I've seen a lot of young people (I thought were "keepers") that left because they got impatient and could do better elsewhere.  Being global, Shell struggles with multiple countries, cultures, languages.  While they try to be respectful, there are a lot of things to miss and mis-understand.
Advice: When a senior manager grows up in one business segment, they should develop a deeper understanding of the other businesses.  Most of the businesses will necessarily have someone that is "not from us" at the top, but it helps when there is a relationship, not just a chain of command.
Pros: In 30 years I have never had a direct supervisor that I thought incompetent.  While I have enjoyed some more than others, all of them were trying to make their piece of the business better.  Some entry-level employees are difficult but they tend to not promote and attrit out the bottom.

Cons: Lacking empathy - no desire to improve employee experience and no desire to create an inclusive, engaging work environment

Rigid - no desire to test new things, ways of working, or accommodate individuals; not prepared for shifting needs, priorities with regard to individuals or the work

Complacent and cheap - mediocre is good enough; no value seen in excellence or disruptive solutions; constant cutting corners; even junior employees are weighing finances against outcomes and it shuts down even profitable ideas and innovation

Antiquated and unwilling to innovate - status quo is so bad that the innovation here is 10 years too late but celebrated as if it were best in class

Fragmented and inefficient - one hand doesn’t know what the other is doing, multiple groups doing the exact same work for years without knowing it
Advice: Streamline groups for efficiency and to unlock the capital to do better work; don’t put internal groups against one another; communicate a shared vision and disseminate it; if middle managers don’t adhere to vision, provide other avenues; incentivize the behaviors and outcomes you want, not the behaviors of the past
Pros: Some leaders are dynamic and people you’d love working with, and they see the problems; but they’re the exception. It can seem when talking to them a great company, but it soon unravels the more you work across the organization.

Cons: Everything about this place sucks
Advice: None
Pros: Nothing that I have experienced

Cons: no free water for hard working, sweaty car wash guys outside.  Bad pay starting at minimum wage and will never go up unless you beg for it.  gain weight eating crappy food all day, plus no breaks for Anyone. Some guys are dirty with female staff, etc. boring when its slow.... Car Spa guys shouldn't have to be forced to work outside when its around 5 degrees or anything below 0 degrees!
Advice: more consistent training for cashiers. better communication throughout.  give ALL employees free water out of soda fountain so they don't pass out during hot summer months!!!  Starting pay rate should be based on any individual's experience.  No1 can live off minimum wage!! Benefit's would be nice. And yearly possible wage increase should be more frequent so people don't want to quit so much
Pros: nice boss and most of staff are knowledgeable, decent people.  free sodas for cashiers. nice customers most of the time.  Safe place to work. Only fun & enjoyable days if u make the most of it in ur own special ways..... etc.

Cons: Shell is divesting in some of the smaller manufacturing plants, so choose the location wisely to not get sold to another company in a few years.
Shell hires future leaders and values leadership skills over technical skills for graduate hires out of school. Only problem is not everyone can become managers so there's a bit of mismatch between who HR hires, and who the managers want to be hired. Shell needs more people who want to have a technical career and stay engineers.
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance. 9/80 schedule, flexible start and end time for the day, and one of the best maternity and paternity time off in the US. 
High pay and good benefits. 401K match program and pension. 
They hire you for the long run. It's very difficult to get into Shell, but once you're in, they invest in you and you can have a long career with them. The turnover rate is much lower than other companies.
Shell is an energy company and is investigating in climate friendly energy sources. Much more than oil and gas, Shell agrees with global warming and has a plan to help.

Cons: Collaboration with overseas colleagues can be challenging especially with so many support roles outsourced to India. 5AM is their evening so finding overlapping working hours is nearly impossible.
Bonuses are tied to the oil price and profitability of the company. While I understand that, some of my highest performing years have been years when bonuses have been cut to 0%.
While technical knowledge is valued, my role as an advisor doesn't allow me to focus much on individual technologies. I feel a mile wide and an inch deep on many technical topics because of this.
Shell constantly talks about upskilling and spending work time on training. However I have found that they rarely actually make time for anything but basic training.
Advice: Make more time for training
Defend the roles you support against scope creep
Pros: Shell has a solid benefits package and pays well for the region I'm in. Working as an IT advisor in the manufacturing space provides lots of exposure to IT and business processes which has served as an excellent learning opportunity. Hours are usually stable with some extra work expected around major maintenance events and during large projects.

Cons: This company is over-burdened by "process" and general overhead in comparison to actual work.  It really over-burdens the staff.  I spend 90% of my time dealing with "process" as opposed to real work.  When i started work with this company in year 2000, it was 90% work and 10% process.  Over the years the trend reversed to the point where "process" greatly exceeds work.  I am paid as a glorified Admin assistant instead of an IT professional.

I am part of the Shell Trading organization.  Trading is essentially a Financial Services organization with different requirements and needs from the parent company.  Unfortunately, Shell treats the Trading division just like the rest of the oil company.   Shell applies a "one size fits all" methodology to all the business units.
Advice: Eliminate all the excess "process" that prevents employees from working efficiently.
Pros: 1)Incredibly diverse workforce creates an interesting and unique work environment.
2)encourages employees to give back to the local communities via volunteer work
3)upper management communicates regularly to the general employee workforce

Cons: Big and bureaucratic, but nothing is perfect. The IT systems are quite dated and crappy, run by some outsourcing shop in India or wherever. A lot of dead wood, that is quite proficient in the appearance of being highly busy at all times.
Advice: Train employees better in people skills, otherwise clever contractors can often run circles around the folks who have been typical engineers their entire lives.
Pros: Excellent work/life balance, good compensation, and training! Every 2nd Friday is off with their 9/80 schedule. Some smarter folks avoid meetings on any Friday, thus you never know what schedule they are on and if they are ever in the office on Fridays.

 Most of the work is done through contractors, thus in reality it is not clear why an oil company would be penny pitching their employees. And Shell does not! A million here, another million there, thus it is far more important to ensure that people are happy and do not squander the money on contractors in order to retaliate.

Cons: Safety framework that is applicable to factory plants or drilling platforms should not apply to other parts of the organization.

Innovation and people trying to innovate suffer painfully. 

Seniority is more often the most heavily weighing factor for performance and promotions.

Strong resistance to changes even good changes are proposed.
Advice: There are many intelligent and resourceful people ranking below middle management. Allow them to come forth and propose new ideas for innovation and improvements.

Give these people the opportunity to contribute and transform operations, methods and systems for the better, faster and more efficient. 

Recognize and reward innovators and people who are doing the extra mile for the company. There is a lot of frustration to people who see their contributions not receive the proper credit.  

Organization for technical and research positions is "shallow" with no clear career path.
Pros: Large, multi-discipline organization with a wide spectrum of R/D and engineering activities. Shell takes good care of its people. 

Great culture for safety and clean operations. Great social and environmental responsibility.

Some people are quit bright.

Cons: Due to downsizing, the work environment was highly stressful, with leaders unsure of what to say to staff.  And thus, work life balance was poor amidst departmental uncertainty. Additionally, although Shell has made great strides in promoting workplace diversity, there are still sexist leanings amongst the senior leadership levels. Lesser qualified male leaders are often promoted over more qualified female candidates.
Advice: HR needs to do a better job with bias training in its leadership courses, and leaders should take refresher training before starting every new leadership role, especially since the leadership training has been upgraded. Also the bias training is treated as an afterthought or a "tick the box" exercise at best. Perhaps the bias training simply needs an overhaul, because hiring managers are still picking people just like them instead of truly qualified candidates. Additionally, managers should more fully support females getting mentors and coaches. (They do in theory, but not in deed.)
Pros: Outstanding pay and excellent benefits, professional work environment

Cons: They put you in a skill pool early on and determine what your maximum potential will be.  Need to be savvy to move outside of those structures, but it is possible if you know the right people and can put in the effort.  It runs like the government, so change is slow, and moving things along safely is biggest priority.  If you are ambitious and interested in a fast paced environment this might not be for you.
Advice: There needs to be better pathways to encouraging innovation within the company.
Pros: If you want a very stable job this is a place for you.  Very impressed with the level of diversity there. People are down to earth and not pretentious.  Having impressive degrees from ivy league schools won't get you anywhere here. If you work hard and know how to present yourself well and align your goals with mission of the company you will do well.

Cons: Globalization of the company has offshored a lot of the work impacting jobs of employees in "high cost zones (e.g. USA, UK, The Netherlands).  The jobs have moved to low cost zones such as Malaysia, India, The Philippines, Brazil, etc.
Advice: Making decisions based on cost (and the expense and impact it will have on people and the workforce) alone may be great for the short-term, but you need to look at the 2-year, 5-year, 10-year and 20-year horizon.  Can't afford to continue to be a reactive company with strong competitors out there such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total, etc. that are in a pro-actively leading position.
Pros: Absolutely one of the best benefits packages, not just in the energy sector, but overall.  By far one of the best 401(k) programs - especially the company contribution after 9 years of service.  In addition, still has a traditional pension program.

Cons: Influencing can also mean that some work can be pushed down that may not make the greatest sense and can make it slow to get things done.  During downtime it can be very bad environment with too many decisions of letting people go that should not have been.
Advice: Think more long-term and outside the box
Pros: If you can become a high performer you are promised with really awesome work that is challenging and can be very creative.  Shell has a tremendous amount of opportunities and can take you anywhere in the globe.  The culture is very much based on "influencing" rather than "dictating" which can be a pro if you are good at influencing especially without formal authority.  An employee can influence projects and work that provide significant value to the energy industry.
Compensation is very competetive.
Many people have 9/80 so every other friday off is a huge benifit.
It is a very diverse & inclusive environment which is great.

Cons: They need to be more open to newer technology. The old guard must get with the times and tech or they will lag in overall productivity. Every shut-in is avoidable in one form or another and there are so many tools at their disposal.
Advice: It's well known that most technology developers want a piece of the oilfield action. As a professional that spent a lot of time on 9 Deep water TLP's and several shelf rigs,  I implore the management of SHELL EP Americas to please utilize all available technology to maximize all of your Safety and Profitability goals. However, I did see a large knowledge gap between upper (shore side) management and offshore management. I would like to see more high level tech training for offshore personnel. Other than that, keep up the great work!
Pros: High sense support and promotion of professional growth. This company has it figured out when it comes to making all team members feel valued

Cons: So many processes.  So many acronyms.  The work is essentially pre planned for you.  The work flow for designing the wells is essentially laid out for you.  There are essntially about 300 boxes that must be checked before certain deadlines, and as long as you do your little piece of the puzzle then everything will be ok.  That may be true at other large companies, but it certainly doesn't make one feel like they're doing much on their own.  

Then there's the whole fact that we're drilling in the Arctic and all the corporate double talk that all the major O & G companies are guilty of.
Advice: Cut out all the processes and forms, and flow charts and give the engineers more power to set the work flow.
Pros: Competitive pay.  Do not need to come into work every other Friday (9/80 schedule).  People are friendly.  Good benefits and training programs.

Cons: It can be slow to get things done but there's a lot of effort focusing on continuous improvement, lean work processes, etc. It's a great place to stay for your whole career, or at least 5-7 years. This may make it a perfect fit for people interested in that/but a turnoff for those looking for start up/risk taking culture.
Advice: With Ben in the helm there have been some bold moves (divestments, potential bg merger), but it seems to me that Shell is determined to be the most competitive energy company.
Pros: The people! I enjoy hanging out with my co-workers and collaborating on projects. There are amazing advancement opportunities for environmental engineers that you don't see elsewhere. It's definitely is a corporate environment, but you see the benefits of that (more exciting job options, great benefits, one of the best company brands in the world). We also have great IP, and some of the strongest technology.

Cons: The company has off-shored so many jobs, making for inefficient processes and communication. Leadership needs to be deeper in the weeds to see this.

There are lots of great leaders but some who are clearly out for themselves and treat others with complete disrespect. Understandable in a booming environment, but when employees are already working 2-3 jobs, not the best strategy to demoralize them further.
Advice: If you want to have an aggressive growth agenda, then don't cut headcount at the same time.

If you want to be viewed as a progressive company that focuses on D&amp;I and mental health, then get rid of leaders who are more focused on their own career ascension than the well-being of employees and long-term sustainability of the company. 

Good employees will leave if they are not treated right - don't take them for granted.
Pros: Good people to work with, challenging and stimulating work, good benefits.

Cons: Lots of beauracracy , to be expected in a company of this size.  Because of the varied departments and plethora of roles, responsibilites, and diversity of customers, every role is a little different so in that sense it can be a grab bag at times.  Companies this big can be very political.  Learning opportunities sometimes more specialized compared to a smaller company.
Advice: Continue the initiatives currently in place to streamline the business.  Take on slightly more risk than current risk appetite allows.  Be more transparent in delivering bad news.
Pros: Shell is a very people-centric company with a global vision.  It offers so many various classes of business with so many areas of expertise, you really can do anything in a company this size.  Left to your own ambition, there really is a sense of taking a hold of your own future.  Work life balance, compensation, and diversity are all top notch.

Cons: No leadership. No truth. No accountability for lousy supervision that don't know what they r doing. Shell talks a good talk but doesn't walk the walk. Absolutely no leadership at site.  No direction no accountability and lousy do nothing management.  Seriously. There is no training for supervisions and they have no clue how to supervise. saw some of the most childish behavior out of employees but management just gave them a pass.  site has NO LEADERSHIP. It's whatever the staff want to do.  Gotten worse over past few years. Great pay and benefits but what good does that do when u r in a monkey house.
Advice: GET OFF YOUR DUFFS AND GET SOME TRAINING. and stop blaming employees for your shortcomings
Pros: Pay and benefits. I can't think of anything else cmon. That's all I can see positive. Done down down done

Cons: If you're not an engineer you'll be overlooked. Performance reviews are extremely biased towards those that are in the right role at the right time. I saved the site over $3,000,000 last year and that wasn't enough for anything more than an average performance review. Had I been and engineer, I would probably have been promoted and given a huge bonus. GE invented the performance review process Shell uses and recently GE gave up on it because it doesn't work. What does that say? It's not a bad place to work, you just have to want to play the corporate game.
Advice: Consider valuing all roles, particularly scientists as much as you value engineers.
Pros: If you're an engineer, you can be CEO one day. Flexible work for some roles. Salary is very good. Benefits are adequate. Multiple locations throughout the globe.

Cons: It's very bureaucratic.   If the benefits are the one of the biggest pros, it doesn't say much about Shell.  You'll never feel empowered to do much because you'll be restricted by 20 other departments, half of which have been outsourced.   It's not a good place unless you're an engineer.  Everything else is getting offshored, outsourced or eliminated.
Advice: The IT department is ruining the company with its bureacracy.  Shell is also wasting too much on consultants.
Pros: Their benefits are really good if you've worked there a long time.  The work is ok, and the salary is competitive.  Everyone does their own little part.  Sometimes you get to do different types of work because they have offshored some jobs(and that never works out because of time zone issues, communication issues, etc).   Shell cares more about safety/training/compliance than anything else(especially making money).

Cons: Career progression can be difficult in some sections.  Be ready to try a new area in Shell after 3-4 years.  Focus on opportunities that add skills to your resume no matter where you end up.  As with any very large company there are lots of administrative tasks and processes.
Advice: Continue to recognize the contributions that your employees make every day.
Pros: The overall compensation package including benefits is top notch. Shell works hard at bringing in talented individuals and places great emphasis on training and retaining that talent.  I'm impressed with my colleagues' professionalism and creativity every week. 9/80 schedule ( every other Friday off) is amazing.  Before I started, people would tell me that those who join Shell rarely leave. That may not hold quite as true as it used to but I've met plenty of co-workers who have been here 20 -plus years.

Cons: As with any large, multinational corporation, there is a lot of bureaucracy  to deal with.  It takes a long time to get certain things done and there are a lot of approvals involved.
Advice: The main piece of advice I have is that it really shouldn't be necessary to go through a major reorganization every couple of years.  Doing this too often makes it difficult to even tell if the previous organization worked because it hasn't been stable long enough.
Pros: The best thing about Shell is the people.  I like pretty much everyone I work with and they are all highly competent which makes it fun to go to work.  The pay and benefits are also hard to beat especially now that we just implemented the new parental leave policy where women get four months off with pay and men get two months off!

Cons: Offices are open concept cubicles for all but the most senior leaders (top 0.5%).  

If you are a white male, your advancement will be severely limited due to the HR policies that are supposed to promote more females and minorities. Most males will top out at JG3 because of the extra efforts required in the name of diversity. This has resulted in many middle managers being in over their head and this will ultimately lead to serious failure(s) at some point.
Advice: Have some 1 on 1 meetings with the people that are know the systems and facilities.  Your middle managers are sugar coating most of what you are seeing and hearing.
Pros: Salaries at Shell are great and the benefits are competitive in the industry.  

Offices in Houston are very nice and modern.  

Great bonus program!

Cons: Unstructured, constantly changing.  Highly motivated and career driven employees  - often apply for jobs so they can "travel the world" on Shell's dime.  Vacation time and the every other Friday off is a joke. Employees are shuffled so rapidly that it is difficult to keep up with "who" has "what" job.  I can't stress enough the high volume of emails that come in 24/7. Employees are so stressed they feel they need to work 24/7 to keep up.  Dead end jobs for admins with only lateral moves available.
Advice: When you find something that works AND makes money stick with it.  All the shuffling feels like an multi billion dollar experiment.
Pros: Great pay, great benefits, highly motivated and career driven employees, nice, clean, secure campus. generous amount of vacation given upon hiring,  being a European Company the work pace slows to "normal" during August and December. For degreed professionals you can be promoted within two years of being hired.   If you enjoy a liberal, unstructured work environment - you will thrive at Shell.

Cons: Highly competitive co-workers, hard to stand out
Jobs are shed when oil prices go down (good severance packages, though)
Somewhat stressful pressure to deliver and cut costs
Not a nimble company, decisions are made slowly
Management is out of touch
Advice: Be more transparent and honest when cutting staff
Pros: High Salaries
Decent work/ life balance
Annual bonus (10-25% of salary depending on job grade, college hires =10%, mid-career = 15-20%, managers, executives and principal engineers = 25%)
Outstanding Benefits:
401K company contributions (not a match, they contribute regardless of your contributions): 0-1 yr: 0%, 1-5 yr: 2.5%, 6-9 yr: 5%, 9+ yr: 10%
Plus a defined benefit pension plan (above and beyond 401k benefits)
Vacation 0-4 yr: 2 weeks, 5-9 yr: 3 weeks, 10-19 yr: 4 weeks, 20-29 yr: 5 weeks, 30+: 6 weeks
Many opportunities to advance, change careers and work locations.

Cons: Management was always very slow to make a decision and wouldn't always hold steadfast down a path that they preached about.  As for climbing the corporate ladder, it was nearly impossible to move up in the company, regardless of how hard you worked.
Advice: Be more transparent and act decisively and efficiently.  Stop outsourcing jobs that you're going to turn around and bring back to the States in a few years when you realize what a terrible mistake you made to save a few dollars.
Pros: The work-life balance within the department I was employed was exceptional.  My direct manager recognized my personal situation and worked with me to find a schedule that would fit both of our needs.  There were ample opportunities for personal and professional growth, salary and  benefits were above average.

Cons: My last role was challenging as I tried to balance the birth of my first child.  I left for better more progressive "parent" benefits like on site day care and less travel.
Advice: Consider promotions for internal folks.  You don't need someone with 30 years to lead a team nor should you have to leave the company to be promoted.  Use the talent you've invested!  I think most of the colleagues I spoke with feel a bit stifled in role and want advancement.
Pros: I worked for Shell for 7 years and then went to another oil major.  It's culture, pay, benefits and focus on people is what I loved most about my time there.  Diversity and inclusion was far more mature than most corporations.

Cons: You can get "stuck" in some jobs.  This isn't bad if your job is critical, but it's awful if they decide they don't need that done anymore and consider you as less qualified than others to change roles.  Some groups have excellent management, but there can be some micromanagement.  Talk to people on the team you are trying to join.  Recent introduction of forced ranking has reduced the collaboration that made it a great place to work.
Advice: Get rid of the forced ranking.  Also, flatten the company.  There are so many levels of management now that staff are far removed from any important decision making.
Pros: Your coworkers are technically competent and generally friendly.  There are really good people there.  It is a large company, so there is room to grow.  Team leads are generally good with people.

Cons: Very bureaucratic, very individualistic, too structured/boxed-in, tough for new people to adapt, slow to adapt/change, people change jobs too often so it is difficult to find someone experienced to guide you, unwelcoming to new ideas, lacks creativity
Advice: There is much lip service paid to the desire to bring in high-performers and new ideas from experienced hires.  However, if the new hire doesn't fit perfectly into the mold of "the Shell mindset" then their ideas are ignored.  If there truly is a desire to bring in new ideas, HR or management should find ways to support those who bring valuable insights to the table.  ...otherwise, like me and most under-35 colleagues of mine, they will start looking for their next job out of frustration from regularly dealing with the old guard.  What this company needs is for more people and fewer projects, so that employees and the company can actually develop.  Otherwise it will always be just a machine following a program.
Pros: International opportunities, outstanding pay and benefits, good work/life balance

Cons: 1. As with most large corporations, there is an element of bureaucracy
2. Some departments are quite traditional dominated by old veterans
3. Employees are not pushed to grow, Shell is like a maze with so many career tracks - one has to seek out his/her own growth path - really think about it and follow with action
Advice: 1. Keep up the good work
2. Make the company more youthful, give more responsibility to young competent performers, rather than relying solely on experience and age
Pros: 1. One of the best known brands in the world. One of the very few company logos in the world which does not need the company name to identify itself
2. Great compensation and benefits package
3. A culture built on respect for people
4. International job assignments - a Shell career is a life journey in itself

Cons: The management structure is very narrow with too many managers and not enough workers, so when productivity appears low or a new CEO arrives, then a new or recycled program/reorganization gets implemented.  This can be frustrating because these decisions always come from the top down without any input from the people doing the work.  Highly technical people are not appreciated or respected unless you are a manager of technical people.  Getting ideas implemented can be a challenge.
Advice: Reduce the layers of management.  If top paying career paths are only managers, then you will only be left with managers.  Your top performing technical people will leave.
Pros: World Class Corp. that does many things well.  Many opportunities to move career path and location.  Shell is committed to workplace safety to some degree.  They pay well and occasionally recognize great performance.  Work life balance is good.

Cons: As a white male, it is sometimes difficult to compete for jobs/promotions against minorities.   There is a strong affirmative action program here, although it is informal.   There is continued negative opinion of oil companies by the consuming public.   While we have done a better job in telling our side of the story, there are too many cynics in the world to believe us.
Advice: Promote more based upon proven experience/skills and less upon "potential" capability for the role.   Continue to invest heavily in the future of oil/renewable energy supply.
Pros: Large Multinational companies offers a diverse working environment with interaction with people from all around the world.    There are tremendous opportunities to shape your own career with whatever interests you may have.   The job posting system we have shows opportunities you have from around the world.  You are not pigeon holed into doing the same thing for 20 years.

Cons: Field and plant facilities tend to be high stress. Unplanned shutdowns or events lead to long hours. Weak development program for experienced new hires. Graduate development is not the best but is improving. Difficult to make quick decisions without many managers buy in. Focus on safety can be excessive or be taken advantage of. DIY Career development programs lead to a non proactive HR.
Advice: Focus on the  core competences of the business become more disciplined managers.  Continue focus on lean and reliability improvement. Workers are being overloaded with non essential tasks, online classes safe driving, time sheets, etc etc.  Push back on the Do it yourself trends and online learning.
Pros: Work life balance, 401k matching after 9 years is excellent. Great salary,  Strong commitment to safety.  Friendly people. Lots of opportunities to travel or change career paths. Open resourcing allows to bid on  next assignment ( also in cons). World class engineers and technology being used. Working in the cutting edge of technology upstream or downstream.

Cons: While you get "credit" for previous experience as it pertains to vacation, you "restart" when it comes to pension and 401k contribution seniority. The good news is the programs are semi-competitive, and only get better / surpass the competition as time goes on.
Advice: None
Pros: I recently started at Shell and have been amazed day after day by the multitude of opportunities and businesses Shell is involved in. Not only does the company offer a great work  / life balance and competitive compensation, but they encourage movement to other groups / disciplines throughout your career. I came to Shell for options and opportunities throughout the energy business and world, boy do they deliver! 

The interview process was also easy and Shell communicated with me throughout the entire process. No other outfits I had previously applied or worked with offered the same level of communication they did. Whether you are in serious consideration for a position, or they are looking elsewhere, you will be notified of the decision. Very respectful to applicants.

Cons: Extreme glass ceiling syndrome, no way will you become the next big wig unless you are Dutch gentlemen.

Oil industry is hit particularly hard over the last few years, and it shows. Most coworkers work in constant fear of losing their jobs.
Advice: When you genuinely care about your employees, it goes a long way.
Pros: Great benefits including bonus, stock purchase, employee clubs and network groups... with top of the totem pole feels.

This company really cares about SAFETY as well as its employees. Employees are rather well taken care of and consist of a diverse group as its operations are all over the world.

Cons: As you can expect from a gas station job, the work station is pretty filthy. The overwhelming majority of the work is trying to keep up with the store's cleanliness. For whatever reason, gas stations seem to attract grime and gunk, and you never seem to get ahead of it.  The worst part in my opinion, however, was the ugly amount of bureaucracy. There's always some corporate man in sunglasses lurching over your shoulder, judging your job. Because of this extra amount of stress, the job is a total revolving door, where almost nobody seems to last a year without quitting. That certainly was the case for me.
Advice: Don't send hicks in cowboy hats &amp; sunglasses to come in and bark everyone around. It never works, and just makes the existing employees leave sooner.
Pros: At the station I worked at, the employees as well as the manager were very close knit &amp; friendly. The job is not one of hard manual labor, and of course doesn't require much hard thinking.

Cons: The only downside I can think of is the commute to downtown Houston. Though I have done it for so long that I am used to it.
Advice: Keep a long-term view of business. Short-term gains may lead to long-term losses.
Pros: They are good people to work for and work with. There is mutual respect for each others professional point of view. Ethical and safe behavior is expected from all employees and is practiced at all levels of management. Input into decisions and work processes is encouraged and self-direction is expected. Although this is not true for most of Shell, Shell Pipeline in Houston still has private offices, which is a bonus. Shell Pipeline, like most of Shell in the US, is on the 9/80 (80 hours in 9 days) program where we work 9 hour days and get every other Friday off. Overtime is kept to a minimum. Also, bus fare (or parking) is subsidized.

Cons: As with any oil and gas company, when the price of oil dips, employees are at risk of layoffs (especially those supporting projects) and Shell is no exception.  Sometimes there can be a lack of clarity around roles and responsibiltiies depending on which team you're on.  Also, there are layers of management you have to go through to get decisions made, but I think Shell is trying to reduce this complexity and get more adept at making more fit for purpose and risk-based decisions.
Advice: None
Pros: This is a great company to work for - training, development and challenging assignments are provided just as long as your performance keeps up.  Most of all my line managers have been excellent - personable and very competent.  Even with the unfortunate layoffs that are occurring right now due ot the low oil prices, I feel that Shell has treated employees with respect and have tried to be as transparent as possible.

Cons: - Culture is starting to become harsh and toxic. Convent culture is polluting the leadership team.
- Growth opportunities are limited. Once upon a time there were plenty of growth opportunities across the Shell businesses. Now its non-existent. Manufacturing employees are seen as black sheep of Shell business.
- Leadership does not practice what is preached. 
- Company politics involved with personnel moves and promotions.
- Terrible reliability and operational performance that metrics are hiding.
- Over worked Engineers nights and weekends for areas they do not support.
- No focus on career path. Development plan is a paper work exercise for managers.
Advice: Listen to your employees. Shell People Survey results are speaking the truth. Correct the issues before employees continue to leave.
Pros: - Pay is well and beats competitors in similar industry.
- Before Convent personnel joined, culture was friendly.
- 9/80 flex schedule.

Cons: Too many rules and regulations, everything one does has to be in "compliance", didnt appreciate the fact that one has to go thru exams and training to be safety and rules compliant but I figured this is something every large corporation has to go thru. Also alot of outsourcing going on in Finance and IT which has caused alot of people to leave Shell.
Advice: Cut down on the excessive regulations and be more opeminded about issues in the workplace other than that everything seems great.
Pros: Overall a great company to work with, always has plenty of work to do. Shell is a very well structured company with a strong work ethic. Would recommend working for Shell. Definitely alot of growth due unfortunately Shell has started layoffs and shrinking due to the new CEO but those that have the opportunity to work for Shell gain a lot.

Cons: Most of the full-time employees are content to be just where they are.  They are not motivated and they know that it is literally impossible to be fired from Shell unless they steal large amounts of money from the company, and their work and work ethic shows it.  There is extreme absenteeism, and a general lack of knowledge and/or un-willingness to learn displayed by the older employees who are just waiting until they get enough points to retire.
Advice: Work harder to keep your good employees, even if they are contractors, and most of all, find a way to motivate your employees who have become fat and happy and have no need to work hard.
Pros: If you are a full-time employee, and not a contractor like me:
-Great pay/benefits/vacation
-Flexible work life balance
-No 9/80s but they do have summer hours (get half day off on Friday in the Summer)

Cons: As with any company, Shell will hold on to jobs that support its core competencies during lean times, so if you are not in that type of skill set, you will be challenged staying, even if you had good reviews.
Advice: There are lots of people that are disconnected from leadership. Currently, I believe that management was forced to make severe cuts and lots of the remaining employees are feeling a strain as the cuts may have been a little too deep. I would really pay attention to the way the pendulum has sung from promoting Work/Life Balance to something that people are now very challenged with working less that 50 to 60 hours in a week.
Pros: Great training available, great collaboration tools to use. If you are open and good at networking, you will have lots of good opportunities

Cons: Shell has a new fatigue policy for some reason.  No other chemical company has such a policy and it is crazy.  No one likes it and no one wants it.  I'm not even sure if management is a fan of it.  Shell has proven time and time again that it wants to be the best.  But by being the best they have to try every outlandish and unproven idea and employees pay the price for it.  Unfortunately, this has caused a bad vibe/opinion of Shell.
Advice: Improve training for one thing.  All Shell Deer Park wants is warm bodies.  Even on the control board.  The control board is manned by management approved individuals.  And all they want is yes men.  In the event of a full-blown crisis, we will not have the experience or the know-how to handle a situation.  Especially in the next few years when the real operators retire.
Pros: The name, Shell.  The name opens many doors and impresses.

Cons: Engineers with large egos without the experience to back it up.  Lifelong project managers who do not know how to manage projects efficiently.  Several employees don't welcome outside ideas.  It can only be the Shell way.  Unfortunately, several staff personnel can be placed in positions in which they have no experience.  They learn on the job and put projects in jeopardy.
Advice: Allow for 6 months of on the job training when an employee will be starting a new position.  Allow project managers to be held accountable for the duration of the project.  It's the project that should be the focus and not the politics behind personnel issues.
Pros: New campus at Woodcreek. Flexible hours since core hours are 8-4.  9/80 days.  Bonus can be as much as 20% if business factor and your performance factor is high.

Cons: Being one of the largest corporations in the world means lots of red tape. A long standing culture of promoting people for the wrong reasons. Hard workers get more work, hard networkers get less and promoted. HR has no interest in how policy changes affect the people in the organization.
Advice: Start promoting people for the right reasons. I was a high potential employee that ultimately left the organization after receiving my best performance reviews and getting PSP awards because I couldn't imagine working for any of the GM's across the businesses in my function. They were all people I couldn't admire or be proud to work with.
Pros: Extremely large organization that provides incredible employment security for average and above average performers. Funding for programs is unbelievable.

Cons: Multiple levels of bureaucracy make it difficult to get anything done quickly.
Advice: Decrease the amount of "red tape" necessary to get basic things done.
Pros: I worked at Shell for 10 years. The company truly values its employees and is committed to work/life balance. Employees are encouraged to take training classes (paid) on a number of subjects, even if the subject matter was not directly associated with you current position. The goal of training is to develop you as a person, make you a stronger employee and enable you to continue to move up in the company. 

Because there are so many divisions within Shell, I was able to work in organizations dedicated to training, chemical sales, retail station management and many others. This was wonderful exposure to a number of areas of expertise and a multitude of opportunities.

Cons: Although thinking outside the box is encouraged, there are so many global policies and requirements for standardization that implementing change is often a difficult and slow process. Some people become frustrated and prefer to work for a smaller company with less bureaucracy.
Advice: None
Pros: Good salary, bonus, benefits.  Ability to post for other positions throughout the company.  Most positions require four years before being allowed to post, but there are exceptions if you post for a promotion or growing opportunity.  Extensive online trainings available to all employees.  Downtown Houston location now has onsite workout facilities. When compared to experiences I hear from others regarding their managers and coworkers, I find Shell to be a superior place to work, and people are generally treated with respect and in a professional manner.

Cons: This has to be the worst management in the history of my career! I am highly ranked for business/commercial and get acknowledgements and awarded all the time. However, with the current group, I can never win. The management plays games to hold you back from moving forward in your career. I have worked too hard to get to where I am and it is a big discouragement for an employee to perform his/her best when there is too many politics, favoritism, unfair treatment, and unprofessionalism in the management you work for. Too many high performer people have quit the company or left the group due to these reasons and I am about to be another one!
Advice: Look into your leadership and ask the employees to speak up and come forward with the "harassment" they face.
Pros: Benefits and Compensation at Shell is great.

Cons: Downsizing and Offshoring has increased workload and stress of those who remain. Job postings are 3-4 years in duration unless management decides otherwise--constant reorganizations. As a global company, you are expected to work virtually (while in the office). More emphasis is currently be placed upon costs than on customer or employee benefit.
Advice: Encourage employee recognition. Value your employee's opinions as much as you value market analysts'.
Pros: Flexible work schedule with the "9/80 Schedule" so you will have every other Friday off. Well compensated with pension and 401k contribution (continued without reductions or interruption during economic downturn). Generous tuition reimbursement. Large organization provides many career opportunities. Stable employment as long as you perform at a high level, network with other groups, and proactively seek out additional opportunities.

Cons: The negative side of working for Shell is that success ladder is very difficult to come by because lower lever supervisors do not train their employees due to job security
Advice: My advice to management is to partner with universities and other companies so these outside partners will be utilized to train their employees and best practices can be shared as well.  While there are partnerships with universities, it is still done at higher levers so the knowledge is not tricked down.
Pros: Shell has a very competitive benefits (salary, health insurance and vacation) in the oil and gas industry.  They also have a culture of work life balance, Open communication culture, and they are especially passionate about the health of their employees.

Cons: Good luck being a forward think person with ambitious to drive real improvements.  The glacial speed of internal processes will lead to a withdrawal of creativity.

The company is all talk on driving simplicity and out of the box thinking. Pray to god you can find a job that sparks some passion or else you may be contemplating choosing boredom and a well paying salary or the chance of a fulfilled life elsewhere.
Advice: None
Pros: Shell has an amazing culture of diversity &amp; inclusion, safety and customer focus.

Typically, the employees of Shell are it's best attribute.  People generally care for each other and place priority on satisfying needs outside of business first.

Cons: Company is suffering with competition and they forget to follow the plan already created by creating another bunch of initiatives trying to beat the threat. 
Some goals are top down but employers are not confident to reach them
Advice: Thrust on your plan and listen to your managers which their lives is study the market. If they say a goal is not realistic you should pay attention to that
Pros: Mobility to work from anywhere is something already established in the company.
They promote from within which is great to build a career.
They put our security as a priority number one and even teach us how to be more aware of daily dangers 
Salary and perks are usually above market average

Cons: Work life balance is non existent at a refinery/chemical plant.
Been with Shell for 7 years and went thru 3 reorg/layoffs already. Seems like the industry growth isn’t just slowing, it’s contracting.
Management decision is very slow. They seem to have lofty goals but doesn’t really accomplish them. More and more I feel like management is trying to push more and more site wide initiatives onto individual contributors which is frustrating because individual contributors don’t have the same pull as a manager or senior manager.
Constantly in meetings that feel like nothing is accomplished and no value is added.
Advice: Keep large initiatives at management level. Have more vision than just cost cutting and “becoming more lean” because it clearly isn’t making the impact that it should. Try looking at more options to make more money rather than putting all of your focus on spending less.
Pros: Very good health insurance, 401k, pension, bonus (performance bonus and turnaround bonus).

Cons: It can sometimes be hard to find that next position.  It is sometimes hard to work at all hours to get in meetings with others around the globe.
Advice: Quit thinking that an American's productivity can and will be achieved by a person in any other country.  It is easy to say that costs will be reduced by moving a role to a lower cost region but in reality productivity isn't as high and anyone working with that person doesn't get as much done either.
Pros: I worked at Shell for over 30 years and it was never boring.  Shell has a policy of having people move jobs every 4 years or so which is a good thing.

Cons: Senior Leaders look mainly for young people, once you get to 40, consider looking for another opportunity because the will not longer pay attention to you and may get rid of you very fast, even if you are a good performer....you make too much $$. 

It is a cut throat environment...but you can make good money, if that is what you care.  

They reorganize every 2 years and post your job under you....(no worries) they will pay you to stay quiet.  Integrity is not their Forte. 

They don't really value diversity...they may talk about a lot but...just be careful.
Advice: 
Pros: Salaries and Benefits above market
A lot of resources, in general, nice people.

Cons: Upper management gets it.  First level supervision and management generally get it.  Sometimes it is weak in-between.  (Upside is that this generally corrects itself)
Advice: Don't make detailed or technology decisions without feedback from the experts.
Pros: Tremendous amount of empowerment.  The more successful you are, the more you can do.
The people of Shell are tremendous to work with.
9/80 days are a real benefit (Trading - Lubes - Get with it...)
Senior management is making a real effort to communicate to the employees, at all levels.
Shell gets diversity.  The most progressive of companies of all the ones I intimately know.
Great information sharing.  Very few co-workers that hoard information.
Commitment of recruiting talent by VERY senior management.

Cons: more work than was shown in the job description; moved to open concept offices - I understood this but it was very difficult to keep concentration on work when there were so many voices around you - this does not promote shared problem resolution and is very very distracting
Advice: company should set up some process where there is '360' review process which includes management - this way if you hear the same thing from more than one 'down' line personnel, you have an indicator there may be a problem before it gets out of hand
Pros: It was a good place to work - benefits - retirement plan -

Cons: Heavily matrixed organization with rather slow decision making. Available cash is limited due to oil crash and BG merger - resulted in a drastic decline of projects and hence project management roles. The end of this challenging period is not in sight.
Advice: Management is trying to implement a project management strategy that failed during the 90s which then resulted in massive brain drain and an age gap in competent personnel. I am afraid that this is happening again and the effects of some of the drastic decisions will only be known 5-10 years from now.
Pros: Great benefits and great (above industry standard) pay. Solid and competent personnel and great opportunities (at least before the oil crash occurred)

Cons: Decision making strategy is unclear for the employees.
Unqualified calibers in high positions, specially for sales.
Over friendly environment leading to many conflicts!
The opportunity to move internal to other vacancy isn't subjected to your qualifications, you must have a good relationship with the managers. (I know it's almost in every corporation but it was too much).
Most of the people stay just because Shell is so friendly and paying well (car loan too). That's an alert to change the policy.
Advice: Hire the qualified calibers and don't focus on the personal relationship.
Shell has an amazing Personal development plan for each employee but it's not effective and managers aren't following it.
Stop hiring friends and family.
Pros: Good learning experience.
Friendly environment.
Work life balance.
Profit share, medical insurance, car allowance. all are really good and competitive.

Cons: All IT has moved to India so extremely limited career growth potential. Government level bureaucracy. Very limited options with global corporate policies removing any real decisions
Advice: After the great ISP outsourcing to the major vendors in 2008, you are left with little to no technical staff. You've sacrificed your talent pipeline to reduce short term costs. All the best have are ready left your organization and you are left with bureaucrat who are more interested in themselves then the company. You need to completely remove replace IT leaders with external hires to fix this problem.
Pros: Above average work life balance, very large projects and systems, highly prestigious brand name. Very good pay scale. A large network of talented international staff to draw upon.

Cons: Always rotating jobs; Company was always downsizing, moving jobs to foreign locations.  entering a market to leave a few years later.  Go ole boy network was alive and well.  At times too many layers of management and very hierarchial.
Advice: Too many politics and too many layers of management.  Deal with entrenched old line management.
Pros: Variety of interesting work; nice co-workers.  Chance to see many areas of the company and different parts of the world.  Salary and benefits were excellent.  Opportunities for job training were also very good.  Opportunities to work outside the US were also good.

Cons: The biggest drawback was the internal squabbles that would go on behind the scenes, that wouldn't be visible to some visiting or is new but it doesn't take long to pickup on the various clicks and whom belong to which... Actually really sad considering the company is an internationally known company with prestige but the battle of the various clicks was very high schoolish, if you weren't a permanent employee you felt very vulnerable...
Advice: Explain to your members staff and alike that this type of juvenile is counter-productive to being a company of this stature.
Pros: Overall was the experience was an enjoyable one while working there, and the pay was very competitive and above average as long as you didn't mind the daily commute into downtown.

Cons: Not clear how they select senior managers. Lots of internal meetings, tons of PowerPoint... Retaining your job can be a challenge: e.g., if you are over 50 years old and/or your Job Group is 3 or higher, you'll have to pray for stability in the global economy.
Advice: Overall, keep up the good work. Create the proper culture for bringing up and selecting high-quality senior managers (prefer technical/commercial people to financial experts).
Pros: Good pay, simple and clear policies, great work/life balance, company events, some of the best people anywhere, ... I could go on and on. Salary was re-indexed (based on performance) every year, it only increased, never went down. Bonuses were always fair.

Cons: internal software is frustrating, company is too big to make improvements and senior people say they support you and go talk to X, Y, and Z.  Then X, Y, and Z will say "that's a good idea, it's important, I understand, but it's low priority".  Even if it can save them millions.
Advice: during the layoffs from low oil prices, refrain from talking too much.  just say "oil is now $40/bbl when it used to be 100+" but when managers say they selected based on a personality matrix it's code for "by how I perceive you and I can make any excuse that I want" which just frustrates and insults people.
Pros: lots of training, people are nice, lots of opportunities

Cons: As others consistently note, there is a considerable amount of bureaucracy, with multiple reviews and processes required for every project.  This is no different than other major companies.  One unique thing within Shell is the increased importance of cultivating one's professional network within the company for continued success.  It was confided to me that management, when determining ranking and performance ratings, takes into account if others in the organization know of you, and what their opinions are.

As a warning to earlier career professionals, re. Shell and most other majors, be aware that once one reaches age 50 one becomes increasingly vulnerable to industry downturns, particularly if one is at a higher salary grade on a technical ladder through either promotion or transfer back to technical from a management position.  One should not assume one will be able to remain employed past 55.  Also, strive to never make an enemy in management, as I have repeatedly observed they will always seek revenge during the next layoff.
Advice: Rationalize the business and stabilize staffing as soon as possible.  Maintain technical competence at all management levels.  Assign younger technical staff to field locations in lieu of layoffs during downturns, as done by Oxy.
Pros: I was a late career experienced hire who worked for several years in a technical service group.  When oil prices crashed, budgets, projects and technical services were cut, and lots of senior people were let go because there was no longer any work to do.  From my perspective, severance timing and procedures were very generous and humane.  I was lucky in that being near the end of my career the loss of my position was not as disastrous as it was to the younger staff affected.

For earlier career professionals, company training courses and access to experts and mentors is top notch.  Short term training assignments at other offices are also sometimes available.  Prior to the price decline, there were numerous opportunities to apply for expatriate positions around the globe.  Once prices stabilize, and the company completes its divestments, restructuring and absorption of BG, I suspect foreign opportunities will again be available.

The new Houston offices are very nice, although adoption of an open plan is annoying and distracting.  Flexible work hours and a 9/80 schedule were appreciated.  However, when necessary, long hours can be required, but may be compensated later.  My colleagues were generally nice, helpful, and very intelligent.  I never had a problem with any member of management to whom I was exposed.  They were all kind, fair and technically competent.

Cons: Depending on your skill set, you can be pigeon holed quickly (and it could take you years to figure it out). Management and HR literally estimate your maximum potential at the company. I lovingly referred to it as my glass ceiling. There are periods when they hire management from other companies, which disincentivized people in management to stay. (Look at the bios of top management in the US to see if they left Shell and came back.) Maybe this has changed since I have left, but it’s something to keep in mind for career planning.
Advice: Grow from within. Could be better on the diversity of management (women and persons of color).
Pros: Good benefits, great people and a good place to make an impact.

Cons: Some departments have workloads with too few employees to meet those deadlines within reasonable work hours.  The pay is not in the top but packaged with the benefits it balances out.
Advice: Consider the number of employees on the team vs. the workload.  Work-Life Balance is a must to retain your employees.
Pros: Opportunities for overseas assignments.  Pay is good, benefits really good.  You can determine your own career path by choosing your next assignments. Shell E&P has every other Friday off.  The development program for college grads is good.  A variety of assignments the first couple of years exposes the employee to different areas of the company giving them insight into what area they want to move to next.

Cons: Over the past 2-3 years Shell has started to reduce their contractor footprint and lower the rates they pay, as well as the margins paid to agency's. While not surprising in these tough times in the oil patch, it does make it harder to get in the door.
Advice: Continue to look for ways to reduce your project overhead. You have a good process, but  ask yourself if the strict rules you have in place are beneficial, especially for smaller work projects.
Pros: I used to work for Shell as an employee and then as a contractor for 10 years in the IT organization. Most of the people are very friendly and work hard to find ways to make Shell a good place to work.

Cons: Downstream is worse than upstream. These comments are related to downstream at Shell. Sr leaders do no stay in their roles long enough. Result….they don’t know what they are doing. They only manage for the qtr, week, day…not for long term profitability or viability. Everyone there is just looking to keep their head down so they don’t fired. They say you are free to speak your mind….you are not. You can say only what they want to hear…but really challenge and you will be gone at the next re-0rg. They Re-org about every 2-3 years. Not a great place to work.
Advice: Keep Sr leaders in their role for 6+ year at a min.  
Set up businesses so 2-3 level of management can run their whole show without a ton of other approvals needed….and hold them accountable for results.
Fire all the Sr leaders of today….they are worthless.
Pros: If you manage to gut out 30 years…the benefit are fantastic. They do allow you to do many different things over your career.

Cons: IT management is horrible.  Lots of employees who have worked there for 30+ years with minimal skillset making big decisions for the company.  Cost cutting rampant due to mismanagement at senior IT level.  Sourcing strategy unrealistic and unsustainable.  A lot of "quick win" thinking to increase bonuses without true strategic direction.  Reactive behavior drives the IT decision making much of the time due to poor planning.
Advice: Hire capable people that have the expertise to do proper planning for Shell.  The promotion of Shell employees due to seniority and not skillset is hurting the company.  Put capable people in positions of power - not just to satisfy HR and demographics.
Pros: Salary and benefits very good overall.  Flexible schedule with ability to work remotely.  Good vacation time and very understanding surrounding sick leave.

Cons: Elimination of the retail channel I worked.    Business strategies seemed to be move of a moving target than a concrete plan that we could stick to and drive the business.
Advice: I would anticipate a need for a retail channel sometime in the future.  I also believe that bio fuel and charging stations are now the "big box" fear that eliminated the retail channel, will eventually have a changing impact on the downstream market sooner than realized.
Pros: Shell was a great work experience. The work environment was fair, respectful, and motivating.   The daily work changed constantly, presenting challenges that kept me engaged.  The pay and benefits are at the top of the industry.  I am proud to have worked for and remain associated with this company.

Cons: As I said in 'pros', above: the bureaucracy of the large company is a negative.  Hard to get away from that.  There are also some jerks at high levels.  Again, a symptom of the corporate environment.
Advice: Weed out the narcissists from among your ranks.  It doesn't matter how smart they are.  Ultimately they'll be toxic.  The employees will be happier and more productive without them.
Pros: You have to put up with all the large company BS: politics, big egos in management, bureaucratic processes that slow everything down, etc.  But, all said, the company takes good care of employees, work-life balance is great, and safety is hammered into everyone - whether they like it or not.

Cons: Upper Management doesn't care about their field employee's and the competitive condition's they face every day versus other retail and wholesale oil marketer's.  They think that Shell is the only brand worth anything and that the brand should open doors and enable you to make sales with very little support, just a lot of scrutiny and negative feedback.
Advice: Wake up and realize that Shell is NOT the wonderful brand you think it is here in the United States.  Outside of the major metro area's (LA, SF, Chicago, etc.), Shell is not the only brand in the marketplace.  There are too many independent brands that the public would prefer to buy from due to Shell's street high pricing.  Get a clue !!!
Pros: Good pay and benefits, but you pay dearly for them.

Cons: Company continues to offshore jobs. At some point you will lose your long term competitive advantage in the effort to boost your Executives bonuses. Of course by that time they will have long since moved on with their golden parachutes.
Advice: At some point in the future you will experience the backlash of the US footprint if the continued reduction of workforce through offshoring. One day the American people will wake up and put an end to the corporate welfare being handed out to companies that continuously elect to damage the economy in an effort to pad the CEO's wallet.
Pros: Good pay, good benefits both above average. Health Vision and Dental insurance. Works at diversity inclusion. In the past was good at building a good talent pipeline.

Cons: Shell is a global company.  They have so many processes it takes a lot of money, time, and effort to get something done which is what I meant by they can't get out of the way of themselves.
Advice: Listen to the people that are doing the work and not the mid-management filter that has lost touch with the basic idea of oil exploration and production.
Pros: Shell is a global company so it is far reaching..  The pay is good and once you learn how to navigate the system there is room to move.  They are going through a restructuring and it is impressive to see the effort they put into making sure everyone has a job.

Cons: Must be flexible to time zones and willing to work with multiple cultures.  If you're looking for steady 8-5, this may not be the place for you.  Even regular hour holders need to be prepared to roll with the punches.
Advice: Continue to be open-minded about employee advancement.  Don't get so caught up in the published career path projections that you miss great talent that can benefit your business units.
Pros: Really enjoyed getting to work with such a diverse workforce.  The opportunities to interface with international offices and staff are enormous and rewarding.  The company invests in its employees and it shows.  The dead-end managers are few and far between and the opportunities for growth are fantastic.  Projects were always challenging and never boring.

Cons: There are a lots of rules. . . .  procedures.  . . Need to follow paperwork at every stage and the procedures seem to change frequently . .   . .  . .
Advice: Need improvment on knowledge sharing and IT issues
Pros: There is a lot of diversity and growth opportunity for women. There is freedom to share ideas and voice your opinions including staff who are less experienced and even newer graduates. You can contribute and make a difference. There is flexibility at work and mutual respect. They advocate and practice work life balance. This is great when you have a family needing attention .. kids or aging parents to take care of etc.. Finally there is opportunity for growth and of course the compensation is competitive..

Cons: I had an immediate boss who was very negative and was not a very good communicator.  I also had an experience with carbon monoxide poisoning while logging a well that I feel wasn,t followed up on correctly.
Advice: Continue incentivizing geologists to be able to drill good ideas and find lots of oil & gas
Pros: I enjoyed the training schools at BRC in Houston that I went through as a geological engineer.  My initial experience with well-site petrophysics offshore in the Gulf was also very helpful and fun.  The best part of the job, though, was being able to propose and drill a bunch of wells in a fairly short period of time.  I never got tired of hitting oil.

Cons: The political pressures to move toward renewable or cleaner energy is causing Shell to devalue strong platforms like fuels and lubricants. They are cutting headcount there when this is the cash cow for them. The strategic changes are opening the door for competition to take business.

Mid-level managers are being cut dramatically making it hard for future folks to advance in their careers.
Advice: Do your best. The senior leaders are trying to save the future of the business. Treat people with respect as you go through the changes... many of you do this really well.
Pros: Great people who are trained to work well together, collaborate, and put the customer first.

Cons: You will never do the job you think you've been hired to do.  It doesn't matter how many questions you ask in the interview - it will be nothing like you expected, and not in a good way.  If you're brought in as a contractor, expect to stay that way.  I finally left after my convert-to-perm date had been pushed back 3 times.
Advice: Quit interviewing people for one position and placing them in a completely different role.  I can name at least 5 people this has happened to in the last 2 years.
Pros: It's great to have on your resume.  Once you get in this industry with a major player like Shell, you're pretty well set for your career.

Cons: In such a global company at times it's easy to feel the sting of bureaucratic policies from centralized functions such as finance and policy.
Advice: I would say continuing to be very transparent through these economic hard times will continue to be an advantage at Shell. Despite cost cutting, and organizational changes, they have been fairly transparent, and I think that is what is keeping employees engaged.
Pros: Company culture facilitates employee engagement, assignments keep you challenged and interested at work, your able to see how you directly add value to the business, your given opportunities to learn and grow along with a formal development process, and your surrounded by people who are smart, open, and willing to help.

Cons: Engineers/Technical folks tend to "work in silo". They tend to cause alot of miscommunication and rework.
Advice: Monetary recognition awards on a local level to encourage employees who go above and beyond.
Pros: The benefit package, one of the best in the industry. Company takes good care of employees by providing great medical benefits, pension, 401K and other investing opportunities, work-life balance, 9/80's, low cost child-care, discount programs, healthy lifestyle discounts, list is endless, ect. Company provides employes all the tools for work and encouranges employee participation in many townhalls, keeping employees up to date on business results and goals. Overall good managers who help guide your career. Many tools for self improvement on personal and professional level.

Cons: Oh my god, very middle management heavy, If your mid career not familiar with big integrated oil do not work here,. poor engineering, no knowledge base in management. good old boy system alive and well. extreme cycles of hiring and layoff
Advice: Wake up and smell the coffee, cut out dead weight, stay cost effective on projects . And get some in house engineering. Having a pool of  engineers that manage contractors in the EPC model is killing you. They never get involved at ground level and do not understand the functions of successful cost effective projects
Pros: Safe work place , Work life balance, Great place for someone to start career and gain experience

Cons: In some parts of the org, long hours and off peak hours due to Global dependencies.  Way too much standardization, across the board approach versus where most beneficial.  Leadership has lost it's focus on the employees over the years.
Advice: Ease up on Global standardization as it impedes innovation in many cases.  Employees have really excellent ideas, but have no way to express or be heard. Focus on People "and" Costs, especially during this slow period.
Pros: Really talented and knowledgeable employees.  Tons of industry experience in the company, as most employees are veterans in Oil & Gas.  Managers for the most part do not micro manage.  Work Life Balance is good overall.  Very nice and accommodating office environments.  Very competitive Salaries!

Cons: Hard work doesn't pay off. This is a great place to work if you're interested in milking the system. If the Dutch don't like you, well kiss your career goodbye. It's a cult of Dutch people. Americans have to stay in position for 4 years, with no ability to move. Don't bring big ideas to the table either. Just do exactly as your Dutch boss says and you'll get a cookie.
Advice: Too much to list here. The future is extremely bleak at Shell.
Pros: The 9/80 is amazing. If you're good, you can fly under the radar and never work a Friday. The work is easy. I've noticed my 50% is everyone else's 100%.

Cons: There are more ambitious people with leadership potential who work for Shell than there are management positions, so someone who doesn't quite make a management role might not be satisfied with their job later down the line if they were hoping for a leadership role. While Shell does not squander all creativity, being a big oil company, they are fairly risk adverse, so there are not tons of opportunities to try out new technologies not already proven in the Shell system.
Advice: More opportunities to be innovative would be interesting.
Pros: Good work life balance. Peers are intelligent and care about job, but not too intense. There are opportunities to switch roles every 2-5 years which makes the job more interesting.

Cons: The company promises to provide you with a work life balance during the hiring process, but fails to deliver when you are hired and on the job. Most employees work 10-12 hour days and even on some weekends just to meet project deadlines. 
The company says that they look to hire people who thinks outside of the box; however, you will not advance far in the company if you actually do think outside of the box as most operating units in the company are not very receptive to change.
Advice: Need to be quicker to respond to important decision that need to be made concerning exploration projects.
Pros: Good benefits and competitive salary. Unlimited training opportunities both internal and external. Very diverse work force.

Cons: Slow progression, not enough differentiation between good and great, Too much complacency, not enough of an external focus, HR function is not as strong as it should be; too many promotions based upon technical talent instead of leadership ability.
Advice: Aim to make HR world-class, develop leaders earlier, promote for direct leadership ability not technical talent, more opportunities to move top performers more quickly, if not at least have more split job grade roles where you can get promoted as you move from individual contribution to project leadership in a role.
Pros: Learning Company, Great compensation, talented colleagues, intellectual freedom, global projects and teams, great collaborative technology, big projects, Technological Leader, pay tied to performance

Cons: Management is full of lip-service. Work-life balance is a joke. Over-emphasis on the petty issues gets in the way of actually doing good for the company by the employees. There is no forward thought or encouragement at all levels to think about new technology or strategies for a future. Management wants to pinch pennies but yet will tend to over-spend on "growth" projects or are otherwise stuck in technology 10-20 years old. No room for innovative thought; go-along to get-along.
Advice: None
Pros: Colleagues are great to work with, and generally everyone is good at collaborating, even between sites and departments. Benefits are generally quite good if not to say even generous.

Cons: Staff and newer management generally lack business/economics understanding &amp; practice, cut-throat and success mostly depends if you land on the right asset/field, extreme politics during oil price drop/bust and priority given to European &amp; inexperienced/new hires at the expense of US citizens &amp; experienced staff.   Lay-offs were above 50%  in Upstream/E&amp;P side in New Orleans office based on last numbers I had access to before I stopped caring to track .
Advice: Pay attention to the extreme inexperience liability/process safety risk given the massive amount of experienced individual contributors laid-off.
Pros: Development, broad opportunities, technical practice/roles, and above average transparent promotion when oil price is high.

Cons: Working of projects, I felt that a lot of the things we were doing were inconsequential, almost meaningless. Some folks are far more interested in keeping their jobs and preserving the status quo rather than doing valuable work. The culture is very male, very white, and if you are not golfing with the inner circle, you will not move upwards anytime soon.
Advice: Top quartile performance should not be lip service only. It is embarrassing that this oil super major can't get past spot #2.
Pros: It has a myriad of businesses where you can learn. It also has pockets of competent managers that make the jobs interesting and meaningful. The pay is also good.

Cons: There are too many processes.  In the Regulatory/Environmental field, it is still a developing business and yet they still try to make you fit into theor competency models, but the models are not fully developed.  Additionally, they want globally for everyone to have the same competencies, however, offshore in US and Onshore Gambia are just not the same regulations.
Advice: Shell does not need more processes, it needs people to follow the proceesses in place.
Pros: The best things about Shell is the 9/80 work schedule and pay. Lot of opportunity for working abroad and moving roles.

Cons: - Significant bureaucracy (probably comparable to a government job)
- Benefits are not as good as comparable companies; need to work for decades with Shell before the benefits get good (at which point you will probably be forcibly-retired)
Advice: Standardization can bring cost savings in certain scenarios, but it can also cause the company to overpay and become more rigid (e.g., in the unconvetionals sector). Learn from independent operators and loosen some of the bureaucracy in favor of adaptability and agility.
Pros: - International locations (although with current O&G prices, there is little chance to get them)
- Work-life balance
- Vast majority of employees are intelligent, good at their jobs, and a pleasure to work with

Cons: The leadership team does not trust or value what you do on a daily basis however they will provide a lot of lip service to just how much they care for their employees. The facts are 70% of the sales force will not make more than their salary even though the company is more profitable than ever and volume and profits are up double digits. They have devices in your company car and on all company devices to track your movements. The health insurance is horrible and even at the most expensive package it does not cover preventive appointments; and if you actually need physical or mental healthcare finding a doctor that takes your insurance is practically impossible even in larger markets. Last year because of several production issues the products you are required to sell were not available for 9 months out of the year so over 95% of the sales team did not make a bonus, however the company had one of its best years ever and had their taxes cut in half but still decided not to reward their employees for maintaining and growing their customer base.  You will be selling a product that is way overpriced and you will have growth rates based on how many people the company wants to pay instead of market conditions or demographics of your territory.  If the thought of making money from selling excites you this is not the place for you and you like most of the sales force will be severely demotivated.
Advice: When the company is doing well your employees should be doing well.  Much of the issues arise from the general lack of empathy and lack of value placed on the hard work of your sales force so some training could help.  When companies are going through a rough time employees understand that everyone has to bear that burden, however when the only focus is delivering share holder value at the expense of your employees the good times will run out quicker than you think. Shell will be around but eventually it will become very tough to find and retain the talent you need to succeed in the energy transition, but what do the rich folks on top care about that since they will be able to cash out their stock options.
Pros: Company has some fun events you can participate in.  You have a company car but there is a tracking device that sends back your movements to your manager. There is currently a pension and 401k but many of the other benefits are being cut so I would not count on the pension staying.  Shell recently passed Exxon Mobil as the largest oil and gas company.

Cons: There’s always someone that is a negative person and/or that one person that management protects for some unknown reason. It’s frustrating, but I can work around that person and still love what I do.
Advice: None
Pros: The people I work with make my job fun and challenging. The teams I have been on make an effort to really discuss D&amp;I and we have had many meaningful engagements this year and more planned for the future. I get support and coaching from my team members and its leaders. I can honestly say I live going to work every day (in person or virtually). More so now that I am in the Development side.

Cons: Shell is trying to be more agile as a company, but still has a way to go in this area. So it can be frustrating how long business decisions can take.
Advice: Keep focus on changing the company to make it more competitive in the future.
Pros: Shell is a global company that is involved in every aspect of Energy. This provides many opportunities for individuals to grow professionally by working for many different parts of the industry from traditional Oil and Gas to the growing Renewables businesses. There is an expectation that professionals should continue to learn and grow, taking on new roles with more responsibilities.

Cons: Work life balance for other parts of the company (i.e manufacturing), unfair salary ranges across the company, favoritism, ill-qualified managers and refusal to change bad mistakes
Advice: Make sure you look at not what someone is saying but actually doing. Get rid of managers who are clearly not fit for purpose faster. Stop swinding the pendulum so much when it comes to people. We shouldn't take 3 people's jobs and make into one to later make into 3. Make up your mind.
Pros: Competitive salary and benefits package, very large integrated company, focuses a lot on D&I, job progression, work-life balance for parts of the company

Cons: Working at Shell even though you get to meet and help many different kinds of people, it can be a little bit scary if you have to work the night shift. The pay at Shell is not very good and you don't get any benefits.
Advice: N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A
Pros: Shell offers very flexible hours, if you need extra hours to work it's not a problem. You also get to meet and help all kinds of different and unique people. The manager I had was one of the best ever to work for.

Cons: The oil crisis has made an impact on the company. Multiple lay-offs which has caused uncertainty about job security among employees. Job opportunities are scarce at the moment. Pressure to deliver more work with less people and less money has created a lot of stress.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, many opportunities for growth and show your potential. Challenging and rewarding work. For the most part, management actually care about employees having a good work-life balance, but that depends on the specific area/group/manager.
Diversity focused company - they make sure everybody's concerns are heard, which may lead to delays in making decisions.

Cons: It is so large and involved in so many projects that things move very slow and projects compete globally for attention from upper management. It is also uninspiring to learn about some of the countries and projects the company is involved with yet sell a different image to the public.
Advice: Consider frameworks and tools such as Principles for Responsible Investment, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or other risk-mitigation and materialy-relevant Environment Social &amp; Governance strategies.
Pros: You'll learn lots about the industry itself and you may be able to move to other areas and departments (upstream, midstream, downstream operations/marketing/administrative/etc.). The pay is great - especially in Houston where the cost of living is low.

Cons: Highly competitive
US based employees often work long hours - common in the petrochemical industry though
Job stability is concerning: Off-shoring US Based jobs to 3rd world countries to take advantage of low salaries/minimal benefits.
Advice: Dig deeper into “middle management”  to weed out the DEI bad actors...
Pros: Best in Industry salary and benefits including paid paternity leave and domestic partner coverage!
Strong DEI culture! 
New performance ranking process is much more objective - truly outstanding performance is rewarded.
Offers a tremendous amount of growth and development opportunity if you decide to get in the drivers seat of your career - those who take a passive approach will be left behind.

Cons: poor lower level management
tendency to transition a lot of Shell jobs to contractors 
not a lot of advancement opportunities
Advice: look closely at the lower level program managers, some are only there because their project managers bust their asses to get the job done regardless of how horrible the program manager is.
just because someone has been with the company for a while doesn't mean that they are the best person for the job.
Pros: looks good on a resume
can offer great benefits once you qualify
flexible work hours and offer lots of training

Cons: Company feels even bigger than it is...change happens slowly, every decision required full consensus (achieved through 4+ meetings) and there are layers upon layers of bureaucracy.
Advice: Management is constantly adding programs, policies, and paperwork without ever removing any.  Streamline and simplify, takes way to long to get to work.

Fix information technology! It is WAY too hard to access information.

People wise, keep doing what you are doing.
Pros: Pay, benefits, opportunities, and training are top notch.  There are good people who are mostly easy to work with and always willing to help.  Corporate culture is definitely preferable to the Exxon types.

Cons: Shell is currently outsourcing IT jobs and a lot of project work  to a new IT hub built in India per the latest  company  strategy to cut costs.
Advice: 1. eliminate bureaucracy and time consuming decision making. 2. bring back to US   key IT  jobs after evaluating the results of outsourcing.
Pros: Shell provides good salary and benefit package including employee  discount stock purchase plan. They have  a friendly international environment . I was  impressed by  internal mobility allowing to move around and get experience in different roles across enterprise.

Cons: - Feel like your work doesn't have as much of an impact since it's such a big company, the progress you do in your role might be erased by the frequent chance in management and/or company processes were you are forced to start over or scrapping a project or campaign all together.
- Lot's of red tape to do things since it's such a large company.
Advice: None
Pros: - Best benefits and pay in the industry
- Have the chance to gain and learn additional skills and chances to experience different roles
- Collaborate with colleagues from all around the world
- Work with really smart colleagues
- A lot of paid time off and vacations

Cons: Like all large companies, there is a lot of bureaucracy to deal with.    this means it takes extra long to make decisions, but good news is leadership is aware and trying to speed up the process.  Cubicle world now, but I suspect this is true for most mid/large size companies.  The days of offices are over.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits - good pay + bonus system, Pension & 401k.   Very smart people to work with and leadership is pretty good.   International company so you get a lot of chances to meet/work with people from all walks of life and all parts of the world.

Cons: But the problem is that there is too much work.  I literally worked about 7 days a week 10-12 hours a day.  I found out this was a common occurance no matter area you worked.  After I left the company, I found out Shell had a reputation as being a "sweat shop."
Advice: Offer the employees a more balanced work/life ratio; delegate the employee workload evenly; and award strong performers for a job well done.
Pros: Shell has great benefits -- espcially the their pension plan.  The work is very challenging. There's a lot of very sharp professional employees who have a solid background in the E&P business.

Cons: As good as the company itself tries to be with policies and training, end up with one horrible line manager can ruin it all. The policies for work life balance, need to be enforced much better. Some departments and great to work in while others are not. Inconsistency across the groups is the biggest problem.
Advice: Treat your employees to show that you value them. At the end of the day if they're not motivated to be there, they'll motivate themselves to find work elsewhere.
Pros: The company itself is great, with many perks and an extensive new graduate training program. Overall excellent training and strives to create a good work/life balance.

Cons: It is not what you know, but who you know. Double standards for those who are protected by friends or family members. If you on the outside, then tread lightly for you could be looking for a new job.
Advice: Look deep into your ranks and try to find the gaps. Your staff at the field level or right above need more in depth oversight. More and more staff are running rouge using their position to influence favors in their benefit.
Pros: Competitive benefits, pension for those who started before 2015. Room to advance, if do not mind moving. If you are looking for a long term position this would be a good company.

Cons: - This company is is not good for skilled, performers, and quality experience people. No one value your experience and good work here. 
- This company pretend to show they are Global company and care for workers. Managers here harrasing every single employee here.
Advice: - Fire the people managers who are Harassing team members. Refer to Shell People survery. Why you are not taking any action.
Pros: - This company do not take any action against worst to worst people Manager, even if people report worst against you in SHELL PEOPLE SURVEY nothing is going to happen. I have seen many cases where people manager was harrasing whole team, people reported against him in survey, but HR did not take any action. 
- No Need to work - just focus on fun activities and learn some jokes to make your management happy and your appraisal will be taken care.

Cons: There is a lot of paper work in Shell it seems very difficult to get all of the different computer systems to work, and you are always having to contact people in Holland to get something done.  They're constantly getting on your case about being chargeable, which I guess is to be expected in a consulting business like this.
Advice: The knowledge sharing could be a lot better.
Pros: The salary is good, there are many good technical people here, and the work is interesting.  It feels like I can make a difference for the company if i do good work, and I am rewarded well for doing good work.

Cons: Not much feedback concerning performance - Closed off culture - not much communications - There mentoring program of new hires is far below average. It was a good experience however I would not return, it was not a friendly, family atmosphere.The engineers tend to stay closed off from other personnel which creates a lack of communication in solving problems.
Advice: Communicate goals and spend more time with personnel
Pros: Well compensated in terms of salary. Technology driven company in terms of downstream (chemical manufacturing).   The company has a good reputation and global opportunities for advancment.  Shell is positioned as a leader in the chemical industry therefore you will a stable career path.

Cons: Their culture and status quo, cliche'd mentality, where you can waste your life.
Advice: Leadership and management should be replaced by the new CEO. The internal hiring/promotion system should be eliminated to stop the leadership culture clones (management) from continueing to reinforce a bad culture that is incapable of competing in a commercial world. The "Engineers" have destroyed this company. It is public knowledge that Shell losses $200M per month, in unconventionals alone, which is why they sold their $2B Eagleford asset for $600M (public knowledge), and they sold their SE Kansas Arrowhead asset, pulled out of the Rockies, etc.
Too bad they don't reorganize to remove the current leadership in N America, without which they will continue to always fall short of the other major's performance.
Pros: A place where you can adapt to a dismal status quo and retire in 30+ years.

Cons: Many of the managers are great at managing projects, but not so good at managing people.  The super-competitive environment fosters negative gossip and too much political gamesmanship.  While the projects were interesting, many of the deadlines were unreasonable and required an unhealthy work/life balance.
Advice: Please take some classes to help with your communication and soft skills.  Perhaps concentrating on developing the people who work for you instead of the upward mobility in your own career would be good for all involved.
Pros: The company has many opportunities for training and job experiences.  My colleagues there were very bright and motivated to do well.  My projects were diverse and interesting.

Cons: There exists a core group of middle management level individuals who offer no input opportunities to high performers outside of their constructed group and the outcomes tend to be 1) "business as usual" and 2) reduced employee morale.
Advice: Executive leadership should get in touch with the diverse backgrounds and experiences of proven individual performers on functional and strategic delivery teams.  Executives and Upper Level Managers should assume more responsibility and accountability for the results directly related to professional development of everyone on the team, not just a select few.
Pros: The company's employment contract typically includes a standardized compensation package that compares well to other employers in most locations in the U.S.

Cons: Large Multinational can be slow in making business decisions, lots of layers and dotted lines do not encourage risk, takers.  Can be slow to promote people if not considered a high potential employee. Lots of bureaucracy and god-fathering can be frustrating...  spends to much time on internal customers vs external customers who move our business...
Advice: streamline the organization and encourage faster, better decisions. Reward risk and different points of view more often, not just on paper.
Pros: Good employee benefits, competitive salary package, good company values.  Provides good employee stability and moderate to good opportunities to grow within the company, across business areas, etc..
Work / life balance is ok

Cons: As a typical large company they are slow to change and frequently rehash/rename old programs that didn't work the first time around.
Advice: Most locations are severely understaffed and the quality of work performed by oversees contracts fails to meet expectations but is masked by fluffed metrics.  Take some time to build back up the workforce and hire experienced workers.
Pros: The benefits are on par with other companies of this size.  Performance is rewarded and there are constant opportunities to expand and grow.  Management is transparent and open to new ideas.

Cons: I'd have to say the only downfall working there had nothing to do with customers or management.  It was mainly employees. Some employees were very rude and disrespectful. Not only to other employees but to customers as well.
Advice: My only advice would be, don't play favorites. Wrong is wrong and right is right. Give punishment where it's needed and make sure it's known when an employee is doing great too.
Pros: I really enjoyed working for tho company. They were always willing to work with me if I needed time off or even when I wanted to work extra day. Manager is a beautiful and sweet lady but also stern when she needs to be.

Cons: The company is a shadow of its former self. No longer the industry technical leader it was for decades. Benefits greatly reduced from previous years and continue to shrink. US workforce less diverse than it was 20 years ago. Constant reorganizations mean always having to find a new job or fighting to keep the one you just got.
Advice: Rebuild leadership development and skillpool management for the 21st century. Go back to believing yourself and your staff.
Pros: Amazing talent. Staff are smarter and more interesting than you even realize. Company brand is legendary the world over. Job opportunities are truly global if you have the interest and the ambition.

Cons: Foreign company ownership is a downside because they have a different set of priorities.  More global thinking, where if were allowed to spend the way we see fit, the US protion of our business would be more profitable.  Currently, we help support other companies, in other countries, that are struggling to be in business.
Advice: Continue to listen to your direct reports; we're on the frontlines of our business, and want to be your eyes and ears.
Pros: The total package of compensation, respect of my peers, recognition by my management, quality of my staff, and the overall support of my work group makes this better than any other job I've had since entering the workforce over 30 years ago.

Cons: Globalization and virtual environment has made working from home the norm, which is a pro and con in itself. Pro = flexibility, Con = more hours to cover multiple timezones, difficulty building relationships, loss of social fabric / community that we had 15 years ago
Advice: Be willing to adjust if the new workplace model is not as successful in the US as it is elsewhere in the world.
Pros: I have been able to bring my whole self to work from day one at Shell. The D&I program makes that possible, and makes Shell a very attractive place to work for me. The people here make the difference.

Cons: The corporate stuff is annoying.  It takes forever to move projects along or make decisions because a million people have to review or approve or something.  It does matter who you know, even though they claim it doesn't.  People who are identified as 'high leadership potential' get promoted at lightning speed, even though the process is supposed to be equal.  There are some incompetent managers in middle management that make you wonder how on Earth they got there.  If you're unfortunate enough to get one of those, your satisfaction with your job can go in the tank, fast.  The feel-good nature of the company means it can be difficult to get honest feedback sometimes.  It seems like no one wants to hurt anybody's feelings or say anything negative.  People who have been here a long time are almost like robots.  You can see it happen as the new hires get indoctrinated into the culture.  If you put together any halfway decent piece of work that wasn't directly required, people act like you're a genius.
Advice: If your employees are having a difficult time with their supervisor, manager, or someone they work with, take it seriously.  You'll lose good people by not addressing those issues.
Pros: Good pay, good benefits, good job security, office culture is generally pretty relaxed.  They say that work/life balance is important, and they mean it.  You can have a lot of flexibility as long as you get your work done.  There are opportunities to work almost anywhere in the world.  Most managers are easy enough to work with and care about your professional development.  The upper-level leaders are really committed and seem to do a good job.  The new CEO looks like he'll do a good job.

Cons: Royal Dutch Shell is a group of companies and so, sometimes individual company "cultural norms" get in the way of a common RDS vision.  Shell is a matrix organization, however, at times it lacks an ability to truly prioritize project work because of multiple inputs into the process.  Consequently, everything becomes a priority which means nothing is a priority.
Advice: Eliminate processes and push decisions lower into the organization.
Pros: Safety is their top priority.  Great learning environment.  Shell employs world-class technical people.  Pay and benefits are well above industry average.  Opportunity to travel and visit Shell operations around the world is beneficial.

Cons: Ethics doesn't fare well when the company is feeling budget crunch to the point that worst case discharge projections are changed to suit financial limits. Speaking up has you crushed by HR and cut loose by supervisors terrified of backlash. I was surprised because I'd though Shell would be a good, ethical company. The V.P. wouldn't talk to me about it when I tried to speak to someone higher about was going on. Be very careful working here, get everything in writing, and be prepared for inefficiency, silos, and territorial tendencies.
Advice: Offer your middle management severance. The perma frost is freezing out any realistic ability for Shell to change. The attitudes keep Shell from improving your efficiency and the lack of accountability will perpetuate physical asset failures and contract inefficiencies.
Pros: Salary is pretty much the only pro.  Benefits are okay but were better in the past for long term employees.

Cons: I am concerned about a change in the way they are hire of late.  Too many ways for managers to manipulate the system to favor a candidate.  They arbitrarily decide to post a job internally, externally or both. If a person they don't like is the best qualified, they repost.  I am already looking for a job elsewhere.  A shame because I used to think very high of Shell.
Advice: Hire the best qualified whether internally or externally.  Look internally first, show the same loyalty you demand  to your employees by giving them an opportunity.  And finally, not all problems can be solved with money.
Pros: Good salaries and benefits.  Excellent working facilities

Cons: Not a good grading system for employees, more who you know than how good you are at the job.

Career development is a bit of a crap shoot... again it’s fairly political.

Not much training given or offered.

Much of your experience may be based on your manager vs Shell in my opinion.
Advice: Need to create better career development opportunities for employees, the IDP process seems to be mostly a waste of time.
Pros: Hires friendly people that are a pleasure to work with.
Pay is competitive, with a good bonus structure
Good benefits and a strong 401k if you stay 10 + years
World wide company, so good chance to move locations, etc.

Cons: Their system of "Job Grades" is extremely inconsistent and is apparent after someone has finally left a position after several years and they have to raise the salary and Job Grade to fill it with someone with the same qualifications.
Advice: Senior leaders within departments really need to get more involved with their sub-departments.  Often they let their direct reports (who are the managers of these sub-departments) just do what they want and they have no clue what their direct reports are doing (or not doing).  All they care about is that they come in at or under budget.
Pros: 9/80 (every other Friday off), very understanding with inclement weather, stress on safety

Cons: Sometimes being too scientific rather than engineering thinking slows down decision making.
Little training or opportunity for learning management or leadership skills, even though supposedly available..
Advice: Allow technical experts to achieve higher promotion (grade) levels.  One of the biggest deterrents to staying on a technical path is the fact that high technical expert is only valued as much as the lowest level of management.
Pros: Very inclusive atmosphere.  
Everyone in group enjoys the job they are doing.
Generally considerate management.
Ethics and safety are heavily emphasized.
Endless opportunities and encouragement to learn new things.

Cons: Work life balance is preached but sometimes not adhered to by management. Many jobs require long hours, more than 40 per week and in some positions working till we hours of the morning of next day, with no extra compensation for salaried exempt employees, not even time off. They take advantage of salaried exempt. Manager not always honest and forth coming with changes that affect your job. Lots of politics and playing favorites by managers in many areas of the company. If a manager doesn't like you (and it usually has nothing to do with performance) your opportunity for growth and advancement can be seriously hindered. Big issue currently, lots of job lay-offs and downsizing. Since Shell U.S. has been taken over by Shell Netherlands, the Europeans have been set on a mission to squash all opportunities here in the U.S. and have been moving multitudes of operations and jobs to other global facilities, jobs that do not create efficiencies in processes or in cutting costs. Many new employees just hired found themselves looking for a new job/position withing 6 months of being hired due to job downsizing in the U.S.
Advice: Make job opportunities legit and more available in the United States. Stop disassembling well functioning business areas. Stop the politics and favorites that managers play. Get rid of managers that continue this behavior. When employees bring this to your attention or to HR, listen to them because the case they present is legitimate and if you think about it, it took them months and a lot of advice from others to gain courage to present their situation to management or HR. Shell was once a great company and know as the best place to work, everyone wanted to work for Shell, but now that is no longer the case. Employees are contantly stressed with fear of loosing their job. Bottom line, grow Shell back into the great company it once was. Give employees a great place to work once again and one to be proud of once again. Stop sending jobs overseas and destroying Shell in the U.S.
Pros: The pay and benefits are excellent. Good opportunity for growth but you have to be a go getter, meaning you must have a good work track record, sell yourself and use your people network skills. Under the right manager you can excel with no limits provided there are still jobs available in the U.S., or you are prepared to move about globally to achieve advancement.

Cons: It is hard to provide precise feedback on a 90,000 employee corporation. I have seen employees who have absolutely loved their groups, but also employees who have absolutely disliked their groups. Everything ultimately comes down to the group you work. I didn't want to leave Shell, but I had no choice. I became jaded, lost motivation, so I had to try my luck elsewhere. I am much happier now. 

Shell is enormous. You often go missing, and don't understand what value you add to the company. It has so many complex bureaucratic processes that make it somewhat inflexible and inefficient. While you can always change groups or projects in theory, it is practically impossible to change groups until you finish your four years assignment. Even after you finish a four year assignment, there is no guarantee to find a new role. 

Younger engineers are frequently treated like high school students and are not given enough freedom to use their creativity. The claim is employees can create their own career path, but in reality, it comes down to what your discipline wants. If you are not hired in a discipline you desire, it is extremely difficult (almost impossible) to change disciplines. 

Higher level management are excellent, but the intermediate management are mediocre. Just because someone has a PhD or has been around for 25 years doesn't make him/her a good team lead. I came across very brilliant technical people who were total failures as managers. Unfortunately, there are many of them at Shell. The last thing you want is a technical manager with no people, organizational, or management skills. It RUINS your life.

There are too many unnecessary practices at Shell. You often spend more time focusing on these unnecessary practices than focusing on work. 

Shell claims to be the most innovative company. They may be the leading company in deep water exploration, but the term "selective innovation" would fit them better. The IT infrastructure is appalling. They still use the slow Internet Explore, older versions of Microsoft Office, poor expense statement portal, etc. There are times that you spend days and weeks for an IT problem to get fixed.

Safety is important at Shell. However, I always got the impression that there was a greater focus on carrying a hot cup of coffee with a lid than process safety. It gets annoying after few months when they treat adults like kindergarten students over little safety issues such as coffee, how to warm up food in the microwave, etc. I picked up an injury in my hand because of poor office ergonomics.  Which one is more important, office ergonomics or carrying a hot cup of coffee with a lid? Some perspectives needs to be added.

Shell also makes you believe that they are the only company taking safety seriously where in fact many of the safety policies they practice are common industry practices. 
Shell has become famous in industry for over-promising and under-delivering. I was with Shell from 2008 to 2015. Only one time a project met its deadlines and was under-budget. Projects often go over-budget with a huge margin. Something doesn't seem right when a company continuously goes over-budget and can't meet its deadline. 

Shell isn't the most competitive company in terms of salary and benefits. HR acknowledges it, and they openly say that they are not planning to be the most competitive company. I received a considerable raise after I changed companies. 

The gap between HR and employees is large, and people always complain about it. HR often provides little to no help to employees. Many “lessons learned” meetings are scheduled, but no follow up action is taken on them. This is a very common practice at Shell.
Stay away from P&T unless you are well established in your role and have at least 10 years industry/ Shell experience. Shell P&T charges sites to do projects for them. See Shell P&T as an internal consulting company. The fact that Shell charges Shell makes no sense. Not only they charge sites, but the rates are outrageously high. Shell P&T claims that by charging sites, they keep the cash flow within the company. Sites claim they don’t care who they pay as long as they can get what they want at a lower rate. Third party contractors normally get the job done a lot less expensive than Shell P&T. This situation creates negative chemistry between Shell P&T and sites. Of course, managers in Shell P&T don’t see the tension because they don’t go to sites, but employees feel it on daily basis. If you work in Shell P&T, you constantly need to keep your eyes open for new projects because you don’t want to be in a situation that you charge overhead when your projects get cancelled. So not only you need to perform your daily projects but also need to be a good sales person to sell yourself to a group and keep your eyes open for other projects. This situation will easily distract people from their day to day job duties.
Advice: Properly train intermediate managers. Walk the talk.
Pros: Shell is a well established and prestigious company. It has a very diverse culture, so expect to meet very interesting people. The benefits they offer is average, but the healthcare is state of the art.

Cons: Similar to other energy companies the bottom line has a strong correlation with the external market volatility. Choosing to work here means living with volatility.
Advice: Reducing the internal complexity will help the company in the long run, and also help to release the potential of the talents in their people.
Pros: The company values deep technical capabilities and innovative solutions, and also values the people who can build strong relationships. If you are good at one of them, you can work comfortably, and if you are good at both, you will thrive.

Cons: Can be very demanding. Don't expect a 40 hour workweek if you want to get ahead. Can be tough to implement new and innovative ideas even though Shell encourages it.
Advice: None
Pros: You can post for many different roles and are not limited to the type of role for which you originally got hired. She'll has a good education reimbursement program. Also will give you credit for purposes of vacation for previous applicable work experience so you may end up with 4 or 5 weeks of vacation.

Cons: As of today, I do not feel there are any downsides. I pride myself on honesty and would be scathing if there was anything to write home about. The fact of the matter is that, yes we had problems previously within our early years, ranging from the office space to systems not performing as they should however the more we grow as a business, the more we look to progress as an employer and have ironed out a number of creases we previously had (so to speak). I have experienced three office moves, and all for the benefit and growth. Opening up jobs withing Leamington, Warwick and now Coventry along with expanding across Europe.
Advice: To continue to put faith in our internal employees and help them further to reach their goals and personal development aims. Ultimately to remain loyal to our customers as without these, we would not have employment.
Pros: Having been with First Utility for 5 years, I have seen both ends of the spectrum. Having teething problems with the ever expanding customer base, given the more than competitive pricing to show customers there is a better way, than just the usual "Big 6". To then come out the other side with over one million accounts and growing our customer base further was a surreal feeling. To be part of the continued success is a great but also shows we cannot be content with where we had got to and rest on our laurels, but to continue to expand and make the difference in the energy market and for all the right reasons. The pros for me are as follows: Our customers (This is the reason we currently have a job so my biggest thanks to our customers), The People, The Environment, Reward and Recognition, Learning and Development, Location, First for Technology. These are to name a few and I really could continue forever and a day. You can never learn too much in this sector of work, as energy is ever changing and something I would love to continue to be a part of. I have personally been given the opportunity to progress within the business which I am forever grateful for given that no other company has put their faith in me as much as First Utility.

Cons: Forced ranking system - hesitate to share knowledge with same job grade colleagues. Company does not appreciate hard workers, but favors hard talkers (high visibility).   If team lead is not willing to say good words for you, you screwed.  You will always hear things like "oh, you did great last year, but others did better than you".
Advice: None
Pros: Nice pay, pension, flexible working hours

Cons: Decisions are made very slowly due to the consensus building required.  The result is lots of time planning, and less time executing.  Shell takes a very elitist approach to Talent Management, and can be very opaque about decisions made.
Advice: Get in touch with the realities of day-to-day business fundamentals, and spend less time in boardroom politics.
Pros: The total benefits package is nice- pension, 401k giving vs. matching, partnerships with leading healthcare providers.  The caliber of most people is top-notch, and safety is not a catch phrase- it is truly ingrained in every aspect of work.

Cons: It is a giant company, so some things are slow to change, there is a lot of administrative red tape, from a design perspective things are over engineered and often too conservative.
Advice: We need to keep our costs low in the current challenging environment for oil producers but not lose sight of the fact that we must keep bringing new projects on line so that we are sustainable.
Pros: Shell has a good standard benefits package. There are great opportunities to be involved in big engineering projects.  Co-workers come from a diverse background, it is a truly global company.

Cons: Not a place for short term (less than 20 year) employment.  Teams are not communicative with other stake holding teams, groups within an umbrella of operations (i.e.: accounting, HR) do not know one another or what functions are held by individuals, so getting work flows moving is difficult.  Getting decisions made is a heroic effort and takes a year of meetings to get all stake holders on board. Long term employees see this as "getting buy-in" meanwhile the plan being decided  on is now out of date and new factors are brought in, all with no action happening.  I know a co-worker in a different area that sat on 5 months of calls, only to have the final call to discuss who they would hand off the project to since no one could make a decision.
If you can deal with these kinds of issues, the pay is steady and job movement is encouraged every 4 years so you won't get stale in a role.
Advice: Encourage team building within the organizations, when people know faces and roles it is easier to be feel a part of the bigger team.  Empower teams to make decisions and take action, rather than trying to get by in from every possible stakeholder, this will allow Shell to be nimble and quick moving.  And when there are hiring freezes, but 3 people leave a department, consider the stress left behind.  Allow hiring on an emergency basis, when your teams are stressed and there is no hiring, it feels like no one cares and everyone starts looking for work elsewhere.  Consider changes to the wealth plans (short term incentives) that might entice the Millennial generation who we hope to be the future of the organization
Pros: The long term 20 year outlook is great.  The Wealth program is there to provide a really fantastic retirement for employees.  Depending on the team you are on the group can be motivational and team centric.

Cons: Highly Political. Worst onboarding for new employees I have ever seen, paired with the most complex HR system.
Advice: Get your house in order. Simple things would vastly improve life as a new employee. Maybe think about an onboarding guide that’s timely (not 6mos after joining) and A) accurate and up to date, B) complete with links and information on benefits that is exhaustive, accurate and up to date, and C) doesn’t require selection of benefits in order to see price of benefits. The lack of transparency in benefit election is seen throughout every single department and most interpersonal interactions
Pros: Great benefits. Cool work. Pays well.

Cons: The company allocates so many chairs for employment---make you rotate globally every 3-4 years or less--when they have to downsize after they purchase an asset for $60Billion and need to reduce debt- they reduce those chairs for employment ---  if there were 10 slots and reduce t 5 ----now 10 employees need to fight for only 5 positions so guess what---you get a package. Enjoy...wrong HR model. Also, grades have been reduced to handle more responsibility through their downsizing and HR use to rule SHELL---but not anymore---moving forward.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay - benefits but benefits have been reducing drastically as well as pay due to BG pressure 3 years back

Cons: Way too bureaucratic 

Too much focus on form (Do your Power Points look a certain way?) over substance (How 
competent you are, What level of enthusiasm do you bring to your work, Do you possess a more compass, etc)

Lots of discussion around career support and development, but did not translate well in day-to-day practice
Advice: Apply higher standards to individuals when making promotion decisions - Focus more on competence and high moral character than an individual's connections

Strengthen the employee benefits packages - not competitive, especially with other large energy companies
Pros: Interesting work

Low stress level

Decent work life balance

Good support for professional development activities

Generally decent folks to work with

Cons: Large beurocratic company that has many processes that are sometimes not consistent. Lots of HR turnover makes it difficult to understand.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company and you will be given opportunities right away to make an major impact.

Cons: I have no qualms with working for this company except leaving due to moving back to my home state 😑
Advice: None
Pros: We were all like a family helped each other out when needed. Someone was always a phone call away when we needed each other. Was fair in the scheduling everyone got the average of the same hours. Pay was pretty equal based on dependancy of your job title, shift you worked, & dependability. No one person's pay out topped everyone else's we were all treated for the most part EQUAL...We had a diverse ethnic family working together white, Hispanic,owners were from India & we all got along beautifully.

Cons: Can be highly political and bureaucratic. Consensus based and slow to make decisions. Lots of meaningless improvement initiatives that skirt around real issues of risk aversion and self interest during a down market. Europeans hold the power and some programs don’t translate well when applied to US culture. Can be very demanding but pay justifies the hours.
Advice: Need more courage in middle management to make tough decisions.
Pros: Excellent people who are willing to help, great team culture though poor collaboration across business units. Great trust in employees that allows personal flexibility when needed.

Cons: Too many reorganizations, too many people put into roles that are not suited to them, have to be in the tight leadership clique in order to really advance. Too much offshoring going on.
Advice: Cut back on the number of reorganizations (constantly reshuffling people around does not solve root issues). Pay more attention and focus on those people who truly are really good at what they do and leverage them.
Pros: Most people are awesome, work environments are usually really great. Great pay and benefits, it really can be a great place to work.

Cons: 1) They seemed to be unfair with evaluation in terms of role assignment based on experience and qualification (esp if you have a Masters degree)
2) Several factors go into the employee evaluation which seemed tedious
3) Managers are known for Micro-Management(not all)
4) Interviews for Promotions (that's too much)
5) I believed I was not doing anything out of the box but definitely not a "waste of time"
Advice: None
Pros: 1) You will be working in one of the world-class company, a major player in the Energy industry
2) Diverse work environment
3) Lovely people
4) You might end up being in good projects if you are vigilant

Cons: If you are not a designated "high potential", and there are many reasons that this can happen that have nothing to do with your actual real life potential or performance, then it can be very challenging to be promoted or even move laterally into positions that are seen as glamorous.  Even if you perform very well, your raise and bonus will never compete with a high potential who does poorly.  If this sort of thing gets under your skin, then do not come to Shell, because it is rampant -- there is a 2% ruling class that gets everything and if you are not in that club very shortly upon joining (again, many reasons this can go the wrong way -- for example if you have the wrong manager who runs the evaluation process the wrong way) then it will never change.
Advice: Get consistent about evaluating employees' potential or do not do it in a systematic way at all.  Get better at communicating the reasons for change -- that doesn't mean more polished presentations and speeches, it means getting real with people about business needs and leaders taking the initiative to talk to people face to face one on one in their daily work lives.
Pros: If you come in as a "high potential" and are very young, you are golden in this company.  Once you have this label you can essentially do no wrong -- even if you perform poorly, it is perceived that you have just been put in a job that does not match your strengths.  Also, if you want to come here and just be an OK performer and never be promoted, this is a good place to be.  You can park here and be forgotten for 10 years without anyone noticing.

Cons: If you are an IT professional outside of Bangalore this is not the place for you. The vast majority of jobs are moving there. There has been a mantra from on high for years now: "We are not an IT company." The way things are now moving cost is the only thing that matters. People with real deep knowledge of how systems here work are being let go and replaced with new graduates in India. We are employing some really good people there but the message the business people pass back is they feel that IT does not care about them, just lowering costs.

Apparently Shell makes so little money we now cannot afford to supply a selection of coffee/tea/hot chocolate for the coffee machines. The bins are emptied once per week. A mighty saving of $25k per year. Times are that tough even though we still make more than almost every other company out there.

So much process is really killing the value we can add. Changing an index on a database table can take over a week because the person who knows what change needs to be made cannot do it. At least three tickets need to be raised then when a DBA finally responds you have to walk them through how to make the change. The extreme cost cutting has killed the value.
Advice: Don't make excuses for the poor performance of the people survey. The scores are low because you are doing a bad job not because people are bitter about change. We understand change needs to happen. Manage it correctly.
You keep saying how much you value the people but there are companies out there that make a tiny fraction of what Shell does who can make it a very good working environment. The little things matter more than you seem to think.
Pros: Good pay, reasonable benefits but these are being reduced to save costs, good people

Cons: Black out dates for turn-arounds.
If you don't like some overtime then this may be a challenge.
For Operations, shift work can be tough.
No Pay for required Basic Fire Crew!
Advice: Basic Fire Crew should be a compensatory position. This is a fatal flaw in a excellent system you have designed.
Pros: Safe work environment considering the nature of the business.
Union backed.
Tremendous opportunities for advancement.
Plenty of overtime if you like to do it.
Union pay scale and medical are excellent!
Great paying job even for those without degrees.
Shell's Goal Zero mentality is excellent.
100% vested retirement plans.

Cons: Power hungry, want to fit in with the latest fad, not forward thinking
Advice: Put your hardest workers first, not the minority (unless they're the best) stop trying to be competitive in a market that calls for the best. The people you are promoting are being promoted because of their minority status, not because of their knowledge. To be the best of the best, you must promote the best, which you are not. I've seen many good people leave because the system you have in place has the "yes" man in management, not the forward thinker.
Pros: Good people, good pay, flexible schedules (usually)

Cons: Bureaucratic. The US projects are increasingly being led by non-us managers. Most of the top US senior leaders have been pushed out. Still believe that they know the best way versus learning from outside.
Advice: Shell may be overcompensating to the current economic climate and will be poorly positioned to respond to the next move in the cycle. Peers are poised to capitalize on the next increase in price. Find a way to support and grow US leaders to take the top roles in the US. Too many are filled by expat and LNNs, or staff that converted to local.
Pros: Diversity, International, Intellect,Global, well compensated

Cons: Lots of gossip. There is a sense of favoritism. People that have family that has worked for or works for Shell seem to get favored for promotion. You can tell they start to groom them for roles that are about to become available. Then when the jobs get posted they already know who will be selected but encourage others to apply just to get enough applicants so HR can't say anything.
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits are one of the best parts about working for Shell. The people I worked with were laid back but serious when it came time to handle business.

Cons: One of the bad things was the long stands and the smell of the trash other than that everything is fine excepte that once or twice you might need to exchange the handsets with plastic paper which is not very safe.
Advice: Renewing the pumps is a good business on the long run although it's very excpencive but it's also very important for the safety of the customers and general public in the area.
Pros: I learned a lot from working at the gas station first customer service and second the stocking of mershindise and cleaning whenever needed , it's a a fun expirience for a first job.

Cons: Slow to make decisions

External hires can have difficulty assimilating
Advice: The success of Shell in the future will revolve around three points:  The ability to work collaboratively with NOC's, the technological foundation to lead in the development and implementation of low carbon/sustainable fuels, and become the "good neighbor" that communities desire to work with, grow and support.
Pros: Employees are encouraged to take control of their personal development, but balanced with guidance from management

The opportunity exists to work in different business units

Multiple U.S. locations and Overseas roles

Community Conscious

Fantastic benefits

Cons: It is very difficult to get decisions made, and there are people in some mid-senior level positions that should just go. There is definitely some cronyism and the feeling of an "old boys club" at times.
Advice: We need more diversity. It's easy to be strong and big and steady, but new people from varied backgrounds can bring fresh ideas and innovation.
Pros: Shell offers great stability and job security. The pay seems to be a bit above industry average. The people culture are great. It doesn't hurt being in the 4th largest city! Tons of career path mobility working at a big company.

Cons: complexity - like any large organisation, company culture still driven more by the pursuit of excellence rather than commercial savvy although that is starting to change,
Advice: None
Pros: work life balance, generally supportive of flexible working and career breaks if you ask, rewards performance, respects difference including disability, LGBT, etc, strong on technical excellence and innovation, truly international and global mindset, cross-culture global teams and international travel opportunities for those with the right skills/performance, talented colleagues, company tries to maintain long term perspective and keep investing for growth even during low oil price, strong safety culture and care for employees

Cons: Strange company culture.  The company expects employees to work for them forever.  Company expects 100% loyalty, but doesn't offer it in return.  Talking about anything outside the company is taboo, whether it is an idea that originated from outside the company, part-time continuing education at a university, or future career plans.  Company offers tuition reimbursement as a benefit, but there never seems to be budget for it and you're always told it won't help your career and there are plenty of internal trainings to take.  Company moved IT and HR to an offshore call center. Anytime you need to talk to someone from HR or IT you need to call a 1800 number and get put on hold for hours and then receive poor customer service.  The company's back office financial department is a mess.  Nobody knows how to get invoices paid on time or bill from one department to another.  Promotions are based on years with the company (they don't really care if you had 10 year of experience at another company before joining the company), internal certifications that mean nothing outside of the company, and who you know.  Company expects you to relocate with your family every few years.  I've seen this destroy families.  Very burocratic company, everything is driven by process, but it seems like nobody knows the process, and it seems like there are multiple processes for the same thing.
Advice: None, I think the company is so big that things are not able to be changed.
Pros: Very high pay compared to other engineering jobs.  Starting salary was 50% higher out of college than average starting salary for someone with an engineering degree.  Bonus is good (when we get one).  Great relocation benefits when the company asks you to move.  Work-life balance can be good depending on your role.

Cons: Complicated supply chain across wide range of product lines.
Large company; slow change progression.
Political mine field between agendas/accounts.
Health benefits lacking behind most companies.
Advice: Continue to listen and support members of team.  
Continue with excellent leadership during low and high stress periods.  
Need better team unity between Sales/CPFR/Category.
Pros: Customer focused with strong upper-level leadership support.
Wide range of career opportunities nationally and worldwide.
Strong and stable company with long history.
Salary above average compare to similar position in area.
Very good work life balance; minimum 40+ work week.
Cross-training available; support to grow knowledge base.
Financial benefit options positive.

Cons: It is a very collaborative company which can sometimes prevent quick decision making.  Change management can be challenging but once change happens the people stick with it.
Advice: Look closely at the habits of the organization and some of the limiting beliefs.  The company will be asked to adapt quickly and needs the right mindset from all its employees.
Pros: Pays generous salaries and gives great benefits.  The people are genuine and generally easy to work with.  The company is focused on solving our energy needs today and being prepared to meet our energy needs in the future.

Cons: Too many cutbacks when business conditions are challenged.  This impacts employee morale too often and the company loses more than it saves from the cutback.
Advice: Focus more on your U.S. employees and focus more on the longer term.  Oil prices will go up and down, the company should plan for an average.
Pros: Good salary - pay is among the best you will find anywhere.  Good working conditions - nice office facilities and grounds.  Good coworkers as well.

Cons: It is a large company, so can be slow to change. They are changing in ways to be fit for purpose but its still a large ship to steer.
Advice: None
Pros: 19 out of 20 people are excellent. They are humble, open to questions, love teaching their experiences, will help you meet goals and are open to you moving around given you prove yourself and put in the time you originally commit to. The company is big enough to relate to people you want to relate with and leave behind those with tough personalities.

Cons: 1. Too many empires under the control of individuals without adequate oversights.
2. Sometimes slow decison-making process.
3. Staff evaluation process is reactive and encourages manipulations.
Advice: 1. Top decision-makers should get closer to the shop floors to get true pictures of situations instead of depending too much on layers of supervisors.
2. Adopt a more proactive staff evaluation process that encourages coaching and high productivity.
3. Adopt more agile business approaches.
Pros: 1. Highly organized with many experienced individuals.
2. Always at the forefront of new developments in the energy and related industry.
3. Trusted brand name.

Cons: Woke Ideology, HR, Middle Management, and Graduate Program. HR is not straightforward with Graduate hires in terms of career progression and expectations. Too much focus on Woke ideology and conformity in the workplace.
Advice: Focus more on the business/making money and less on ideology. Leaders should make the business a priority instead of wasting time mandating CRT policies that divide the coworkers.
Pros: Benefits, Salary, Senior Leaders, and Facilities. Like most Oil and Gas companies, Shell pays well and has good benefits.

Cons: No lunches, No breaks, No raises for the most part. Many employees refuse to do their job and work and gets shoved on few who do work.  Management won't do anything to employees who are late and refuse to do the work required. Long hours on feet with no breaks. Very hard job if do what needs to be done.
Advice: Listen to the employees who do their job and reward them.  Give raises to those who deserve it.  Keep the good employees and eliminate the bad ones. Hold employees accountable for their lack of work and care.  Make people be on time and not shove work onto just a few.
Pros: Get paid weekly.  No point system if you miss work.

Cons: ...... they will support projects as long they have a profile and are "urgent".... but sometimes they are likely to drop them in favor of the next "priority".... often leaving the first project incomplete and benefits not fully realized.
Advice: Complete the task.  See projects through to full implementation.  Squeeze all possible benefits from the investments you make.  Keep on being willing to resource projects as you do.
Pros: Company has deep pockets, and a desire to do the right thing, correctly.  They will spend to get the result they are looking for...

Cons: Stay in the senior leadership graces or you will not advance. Re-org takes place every 4 or 5 years. Good people let go esp when they fall out of grace.
Advice: Don't just promote favorites - or D&I candidates based on physical traits. D&I is much deeper than surface level.
Pros: Responsibility at all levels. Learning and development pushed. Good work like balance. Fair compensation. Collaboration is expected - however, some directive is required.

Cons: The legal management team is under-skilled and is primarily interested preventing discovery of that fact so that they can preserving their own great salaries and benefits.
Advice: Give up your seats to people who know the business.  It takes more than flag-waving to get value out of the team.
Pros: The company pays well and has great benefits for employees.  Also it is fundamentally a strong company.   It has a decent reputation and I believe that corporate leadership tries to care about the planet more than other companies.

Cons: Some positions requires relocating and of course some position require long working hours but you get more days off of course.  some of the positions requires you to stay in that position for at least 4 years before you can transfer to another position, but i think these are mostly technical positions.
Advice: The managers were pretty fair and offered me challenging assignments.
Pros: They have excellent benefits, very good pay and very knowledgeable employees. Shell offer great opportunities for advancement and is a very stable company.

Cons: Too much trespassing by homeless people and drug dealers. Store on a main street where  to much was going on. Being locked in on shifts where employees didn't show up for they're shift.
Advice: Hire people that are dependable as well as on time. Train employee's for more than a day or two, plus give employee's the option to train manager's position after 9 months to a year
Pros: Well kept establishment and clean. Good communication with my employers as well as employees. Not too far from my home and easy to get to.

Cons: Appraisal process and performance bonus is terrible.
Too many manuals, standards and processes that forces engineers to deliver super conservative solutions, eliminates potential cost saving opportunities and create boundaries for creativity to take place.
Advice: Change the performance appraisal process to be objective and not subjective.
Employees must be given the performance bonus based on a system where for each objective accomplished the will receive a portion of the eligible bonus.
Pros: Excellent company, great benefits, outstanding engineering staff with great training.
The wells Round 1 and round 2 certificate program delivers the perfect solution to accelerate engineers through the learning curve.

Cons: Bureaucracy from hell. You will never ever get anything done.
Soul sucking as you realize you're just a cog in a machine you don't understand
Advice: Greatly reduce complexities and focus on the bottom line. The organization could exist with half as many people and would run far better. Too many cooks in the kitchen justifying their own existence.
Pros: Great benefits
Tons of mobility (if you live in Hague, Houston, or Bangalore)
Great stock discounts

Cons: Can take awhile for decisions to be made and actions completed.   Some leaders struggle with flexible ways of working, though this is becoming the norm for many employees.   Shell wants to be master of all, versus making difficult decision to not be so many areas of value chain.
Advice: None
Pros: I'm proud to work for a company that is contributing in multiple ways to the everyday lives of people around the globe.  The overall quality of people, systems, and processes is what allows Shell to excel in many ways.

Cons: Bureaucratic, slow, arrogant. Work life balance is terrible, they will work you to the ground
Advice: Strive to change from a company that thinks it knows it all... to one that tries to continually learn and grow and adapt.   The arrogance of the former is stifling and unattractive culturally, to gen-ex's, millennials and younger generation employees. Also, walk the talk in upper management when it comes to diversity.  A leadership board full of white boomer males sends the wrong message.
Pros: Top O&amp;G operator, one of the best, lots of good benefits

Cons: Weak senior leadership.  Very bureaucratic.  Focused on generating processes and procedures rather than on meaningful action.  Slow decision making.  Paralysis by analysis.  Comments to leadership are in reference to non-US based leaders.  The same innovation referenced in best reasons can also be a hindrance when we go overboard to gold plate a project when something simpler may have sufficed.

IT and HR are horrible.  IT extremely fearful of new ideas and way behind and HR is clueless.  IT decisions appear to be based exclusively on cost of maintaing system/software and not on value to end-users.  This results in tools being rolled out with features rendered shut down.  This reduces the cost of support.  But that is only because so many features have been shut down or configuration is so convoluted that the software is practically unusable.  So, obviously support costs are down because no one is using the software.  

Greater offshoring of jobs, especially at the lower levels but also review of moving jobs at the next level.  The problem with that model is that if you don't have entry level jobs in the US, what happens to the jobs pipeline?  Where will the people for the next level jobs come from?
Advice: Retire.  Reference is to non-US based leaders.  The senior leadership in the US (in my business) is excellent with a great deal of credibility.  But are hamstrung by the Royal Dutch Shell leadership.
Pros: The pay and benefits are excellent.  The engineering staff is great and very innovative.  Impression that there is a greater degree of freedom to be creative than in other companies, e.g. Exxon.  Exception to creativity is is in general IT, i.e. desktop tools.

Cons: Oil & Gas industry, as the industry down turns, the company fluctuates with resources in a less than expected manner. Expatriate positions are getting too limited, which was a significant employee value proposition
Advice: More structured resourcing; instead of huge waves of deployment and recruitment have a robust longer term view. Need to carry out look back of bast 20 years of Mergers and Acquisitions and learn from findings.
Pros: Global Energy company, with great development opportunities. Opening a new chapter through entering to alternative energy sources. An industry leading company with significant R&D capabilities

Cons: They have employees pegged who are going to move up ( no matter how they perform) and if your not one of them your out of luck. Lots of Nepotisim.  The company doesn't realize the talent they have working for them. They
Operate out of a funnel.
Advice: They need to not just look at the bottom line because all markets and opportunities are not the same.
They need to look at promoting the employees who have the skills instead of all the G Grades who they give the upper hand too.
Pros: Pay, bonus structure, benefits, work life balance

Cons: * far too many changes in the organization
* little stability/security in position due to changes
* can be inefficient due to large size and layers of bureaucracy
* senior management seems artificial and distant at times
* corporate propaganda is very strong and presented with euphemisms (i.e., slogans, campaigns, soundbites, "new ways of working", etc)
* not easy to move up in the company unless you know someone
Advice: be real
Pros: * salary and benefits are exceptional
* get to work with a diverse group of colleagues
* lots of volunteer / community service opportunities
* flexible working schedules; good work/life balance

Cons: Management, Boom & Bust industry, Slow to move, slow to change. There are too many incompetent middle managers. HR is a train wreck after hiring, often impersonal. Change is very slow to happen.
Advice: Better middle management selection.Even high level managers seem chosen for all the wrong reasons. Team leads are really hit or miss and favoritism can play a big part in advancement.
Pros: Benefits, Pay, Culture, People. The quality of colleagues is high, hiring process is very streamlined and fair, but difficult. Everything is team oriented and collaborative. International experience and opportunities.

Cons: As with most customer service jobs, its usually the dealing with irate, or angry at the world customer, that can really get to you if you aren't able to deal with a high level of stress, and all at once, I mean. The ABSOLUTE WORST experience, with this company was management. I could not believe I was taking the risk of being the helpful new girl, and helped my manager out when it came to doing a shift, that was really working completely against my very strict schedule, as 3rd shift is changing my normal sleep patterns, and other very important aspects of my life outside the (9-5), and she slept over 3 hours, and barely cared to apologize, just came in and asked about what I did, and said I can leave. I was done after having so many issues being horribly trained, and thrown to the wolves for four straight weeks. If you decide to work for any company, research and look up reviews for that specific location. You don't want to work for a company that is desperate for employees, but have no real consideration for them.
Advice: I would say, reconsider the way that you choose to consider what training is. I was very disappointed to know that, Although I really wanted to excel, and have a great working experience, I wasn't able to reach my full potential for lack of effort on behalf of the management at the location I was working at.
Pros: I am definitely considered an EXTROVERT, so having interpersonal experiences with people, is usually my go to. Its great to interact with a lot of people from all over, and of course, this job wouldn't have even been worth it, if you don't have your typical "regulars". Meeting and greeting new people for the benefit of also networking, was the best part of the job.

Cons: No overtime, sick, or vacation pay, no room to grow with company, expected to work 6 or 7 days a week, subjected to call in at anytime  (always on call) expected to work birthdays and holidays.
Advice: Try to be a little more understanding when it comes to employees. Need to give full time benefit if working employees full time, need to give incentive for employees to work overtime. Maybe consider paying overtime. Also wont to offer insurance to full time employees.
Pros: Fast pace job, everyday is a new experience, friendly customs. Flexible hours, lots of hours if willing to work, decent pay, great coworkers

Cons: #1 - It's Too "Corporate"

If you're looking for meaningful work at a company that's actually making a difference in the world while offering a highly energetic work environment where you're encouraged to do big things and challenge the status quo, then I'm afraid to say that you'll find your experience at Shell to be quite disappointing. That just isn't the way Shell's culture works - it's an extremely "corporate" environment. Almost everyone is there for the generous compensation. To me, that just wasn't enough - I want to make money doing meaningful work that I can be proud of. 

#2 - You Might Not Be Able To Keep Your Job

I witnessed many of my older colleagues get let go (they "retired") as part of reorgs.  Even if you've decided that the paycheck is the most important thing and that's why you want to work for Shell, you might not get to stay as long as you'd like. 

#3 - Finance Is Weak

Looking for a place where Finance is considered a true partner to the business? Where the business you support really values your opinion and wants you seated at the table with them? This isn't the place for that. There's a "I'll fill you in on what's going on once the deal is done so you can handle the administrative part" sort of mentality in the company. It is deeply embedded within the culture and from my understanding it's been that way long before I joined the company. It's hard to make an impact when the group you support views Finance this way.

#4 - It Might Conflict With Your Personal Values

I had a hard time working for a company whose core business in oil and gas contributes meaningfully to climate change. I see the company as part of the problem, not the solution. It's great to see that Shell acknowledges climate change, but there's really no substance behind it in my view. Yes, the company is investing in renewables, but at least from my perspective it seems like more of a PR stunt than anything else. The emphasis within the company is overwhelmingly on the oil and gas businesses that generate the profits.
Advice: They don't take feedback seriously, though lip service is given to it. So, I won't waste my time.
Pros: Shell is a good place for you if all you care about are pay and benefits. The culture also fosters a respectful environment, but politics at the Houston Woodcreek campus is the rule, not the exception.

Cons: This is a great spot to get your basic aligned and then you should leave before you stalemate. Shell is miserly on essentials like offices and the intangibles.
Advice: Learn to appreciate and reward dedicated and diligent employees! Terminate the low producers instead of keeping them and giving time related raises.
Pros: Shell has great people & great benefits and despite issues, I would recommend people seek opportunities! The US personnel will never be trusted - only the Dutch and English.  Texans can't hold the top spots since John Hofmeister (Shell Oil CEO) and Fran Keeth (Shell Chemicals CEO)

Cons: It takes forever to do anything and there is an overwhelming process for everything. It is now a tougher environment in the industry, but as the company looks to control costs, I am seeing more and more decisions that are reasonable when only looked at from a financial perspective, but questionable when considering the complex requirements of this business.
Advice: A dose of humility would be wise in light of Alaska fiasco and now-questionable BG merger.
Pros: Good salary, benefits. Hiring process for engineers is tough and brings great people into the company. Smart, capable people everywhere.

Cons: Good ol' boy culture is still heavily ingrained - Fox news is played openly in a lot of offices, politics/networking is heavily emphasized, word spreads fast in a large company, management can sometimes be disconnected, lots of change and not all of it is good
Advice: Communication and employee work/life balance are always the 2 lowest rated in the Shell People Survey... think over it rather than starting yet another initiative. Transparency is key, especially in times like this.
Pros: Great pay and benefits, large company means lots of opportunities globally, emphasis on training and developing the individual, caring culture

Cons: Having to work a double shift because there is no one to relieve you happened too often.
Advice: Security came in and fired me stating I was seen on camera giving away a car wash. Of course I gave the guy a car wash he paid for it, he is the nice repeate car wash customer who got a call before he had time to go thru the wash, and loosing his ticket I printed him a new one
Pros: Independent working environment, customer loyalty, truely a good product with well done work space and a proper cash that was an easy sell.

Cons: A lot of geoscience experience "retired."  Shell's solution is to rapidly rotate junior staff and keep everyone in an open office.  We either don't have time to work and be creative, or we don't know how to do the work.
Advice: 5 years in unconventionals, 5 years in planning, 5 years working pre-salt Braxil exploration...these are not interchangeable employees.  Give people an option to stay where they like--I do not want to train up another junior staffer who is checking a box before moving on to something else.
Pros: High pay.  Hard to get laid off if you're under 50.

Cons: same old boys club. They do not even try to id talent within their ranks unless you are in the old boy network. Lip service is paid to advance women and minority women is even scorned.
Advice: Hold your managers to account for advancing women and minority women particularly. Stop the stupid posting that says you have a job for 3 years. It is then just used to push out women and older workers when they reach their peak earning potential. HR is a joke. No one..not HR or management is tasked to keep track of talent and open posting is misused by mangers to play games with layoffs. They use this tactic to fire without cause and layoff without saying it is a layoff. Using the word redundant HR just lets you scramble to find a job without any support from management and HR is a powerless joke that is outsourced. Managers never have to explain to anyone when they make minorities or women redundant since your job is always posted for 3-4 years. You always are applying for your job every 4 years so forget about a career..they could care less. Go to a US company like Exxon or Chevron where they want talent to be career employees without playing games every three year or so. Shell reviews for performance are meaningless to employees. Watch out when you are late 50's and your peak earnings kick in since they use posting to eliminate longtime employees without cause or calling for layoffs. They eliminate long serving minorities and women using these tactics.
Pros: big oil company with benefits and salaries which are average for the industry. Used to be run by skilled technically astute managers. Now they rotate MBA's who have little knowledge about the company of the specific area in the industry. They rotate managers every 2-3 years so employees are always training former biz consultants who have little knowledge of Shell values and culture of excellence which was a huge strength in the past. Bean counters everywhere who make so many missteps and are never accountable since they just move on. Great place to work if your are a clueless MBA posing in the energy business. Hope the new CEO clears the decks of pathetic managers who just try to create another level of useless effort for the employees. Lots of chiefs and too few knowledge workers since outside consultants have sold executives that having engineering skills is unnecessary for MBA's. Real STEM skills are no longer appreciated or valued. It intimidates the clueless bosses who were hired to count beans and become deal makers who have no idea that their deals fall flat so often but they just skip on to a new assignment without be accountable for the mess they cause. Seems awfully close to a BP model where dividends trump value every time due to finance/commercial running everything without vision or respect for employees
.

Cons: It is a really large corporation that can sometimes feel like it is run by the HR and Real Estate departments instead doing the right thing for individual parts of the company.  "Globalization" is the buzz word these days.
Advice: It would be nice to keep the change to a minimum.  Recently, they have done a good job of this although new acquisitions have in inevitably led to some shake up.
Pros: A solid company with a history of high performance all around the globe.  Shell does try to handle its employees with integrity.

Cons: With emphasis on standardized work processes to lower costs, individuality becomes difficult.  HR system seems to favor only management oriented profiles.
Advice: The body is many parts not just the head.  Advancement should recognize that different jobs require different types of people not just those who score high on standardized CAR (Capacity, Aptitude, Relationships) assessments.  I
Pros: Generally hire top quartile grads with great potential.  Not a place for the dimwitted or the lazy.   Many advancement opportunities for those who seek it and work the extra hours.  High expectations for performance and thoroughness to advance.

Cons: It’s hard to get a raise, some of the customers treat you like crap and you can’t do anything about it so it starts to wear on you, the company chooses favorites, if you print lottery wrong and the customer doesn’t want it you come out of pocket for it, all the employees complain about the other
Advice: You should pay people what they are worth not by the number of years they work there.
Pros: We get discounted tacos
We have customers that come in every day that become good friends and contact for new jobs

Cons: Terrible development programs, all trappings of a typical super major(no accountability &amp; burdened by massive bureaucracies)
Advice: Make a plan and drive it down the reporting chain, ensure your team has clear guidance on success, get input from everyone on your team not a select few, be careful of those that seem to never disagree with you as your confirmation bias is can dissuade you from the truth,
Pros: Great Benefits
With the right connections you can go wherever you please by working the system

Cons: Comp and benefits behind competition, BP, Chevron and set for graduate entry. Very limited consideration given to experienced hires with 15 years plus. Numbers show Shell has difficulty retaining new experienced talent, and will struggle as baby boomers retire.  Average age in Shell is high.  Experienced talent goes to E&P independents with much better comp and benefits, Anadarko, Devon. Management acts in a vaccum. As no projects fail, only some of the involved are guilty and suffer. The appearance of the Shell is clean, shiney and swift. The reality, there is a great deal that goes on and is never brought to light.
Advice: Listen to employees. Respond to meet the needs of aging workforce and gap from "the big crew change". Count your contractors. You have no idea of your total workforce numbers on any given week to within thousands. Analyze your projects, increase audit and conduct more postmortems they cannot all be so successful.  Is exploration success really on par with apparent ability? Focus on hiring talent to do the work, rather than manage and direct. 

Get serious about work/life balance. Walk the talk. 

Performance management archaic. The company is not open to new ways and ideas.  

Workforce planning is dismal. only talking about bringing in and retaining talent.  Internal postings receive 95% of the attention for internal development of career employees.  No allowance that talent from the outside could provide fresh ideas and better perspectives to resolve problems or develop. 
Without being Shellacked for ten years survivability low. 

Understated reserves and poor exploration success has plagued the company for more than five years.
Pros: Global Fully integrated Oil and Gas company. Sufficient resources to do work. Great employer for a career as a specialist in an exploration and production technology.  Good general but limited in true details about important company activity around the globe, especially if negative. Management decisions are made by stakeholder concensus rather than command and control.  This is to Shell's credit.  No project or initiative fails, this is not possible.  Shiney side is always up.  Branding is unbeatable and clean restrooms are tops! Shareholders should expect more. Many jobs are moving offshore that should be good for other countries.

Cons: This facility is separated by different departments and you are not encouraged by some of the managers to help other people from other departments. If you do, you get reprimanded and labeled as an person who is not reliable to your own department.
Advice: None
Pros: Its a great place to learn the different aspects of the supply chain from a warehouse, blending and shipping facility.  You feel like its a very safe environment and they make safety as their number one priority.

Cons: Large global company sometimes makes it challenging to navigate org structure and figure out career development opportunities.
Advice: Don’t lose sight of your people and keep up the positive culture momentum.
Pros: - Parental leave: moms get 16 weeks 100% pay, dads get 8 weeks (in the US). 
- compensation well above average both salary and vacation time. 
- Culture is amazing! Despite the corona pandemic and a global reorg (which left many uneasy as you could imagine) leadership handled it in the best way they could. I’ve truly felt cared for since day 1 working here.

Cons: Being seen in best political light is very important.
Company is not always fair in handling promotions / layoffs.
Good work, performance are not always rewarded; politics are more important.
Probably a good place to stay for a few years before moving on, for most people.
Too big and impersonal.
Advice: Take some risks in new plays, or the company may die.
Pros: Lots of good training.
Excellent presentations on multiple technical projects.
Lots of diverse projects to get involved in.

Cons: Innovation is muted by global processes. It is tough to react swiftly in a changing environment. This is particularly frustrating when the resources are in place but the ability to execute is hindered by bureaucracy.
Advice: Too much focus on collaboration which some employees take to mean consensus. More focus needs to be on informed decision making.
Pros: Very few roles will not have at least some interface with global colleagues. While the number of expat roles are decreasing, there is ample opportunity to work with global teams if you are a decent performer.

Cons: Angry customers, lazy co-workers, my manager kept scheduling me times when I worked at my other job even though I gave them my other schedule a whole month in advance. Very discouraging. After about an hour of training on the cash register my supervisor gave me the phone and said to call them if I needed help and left me alone in the store on my first day. Not the best training strategy...
Advice: Better training for new employees. PAY ATTENTION to day employees request off.
Pros: The actual work was easy. Typical gas station work.

Cons: May end up in a crappy project, lower level managers are for the most part just corporate jargon jack-in-the-boxes, level of process stifles agility and creativity, poor performers are not punished leading to low morale across teams
Advice: Provide more opportunity for technical people to advance. There are lots of very good, motivated technical people that have no interest in management that you will lose after a decade or so if you don't give them equal opportunities
Pros: Opportunity for travel, great training, some projects are awesome, salaries for new employees are quite high, relaxed working environment (9/80s, etc)

Cons: It's not really a downside - but you will get out of it what you put in. Some people have bosses that will push them more, while others will leave you to it, but this means you get to learn & develop as fast as you want to.
Advice: Thanks for taking a bet on younger people - I hope you continue to do this!
Pros: This was an experience I won't forget. Even for temporary / intern employees, the group went out of their way to give us every opportunity to learn and develop ourselves.

Cons: Because of the big size of the company there is a lot of overhead and waste and it is not always easy to get something done
Advice: Be aware of middle management which is creating their own kingdom. Enterprice first should be the main driver. Creating own kingdoms should be prevented
Pros: A very solid, mature and reliable company where you can gain a lot of knowledge and develop in different disciplines. Comply, Intervene and Respect are the most important rules and are being followed by all staff from high to low.

Cons: Global environment and meetings.  Doing business in over 100 countries and making policies to fit for all.  The meetings seem to go on and getting the work done sometimes come in second to attendance.
Advice: Practice your Core Values of Honesty, Integrity, Respect.  Monitor mid-level Supervisors and Front Line Supervisors to see who actually use/practice them.
Pros: Good benefits, people, environment.  Sometimes (under certain supervisors) Work Life balance is a challenge especially with the challenging petroleum and energy industries.

Cons: Some people think that Shell revolves around them, which is not necessarily true. Don't let them think this way! Company sponsors good values. Pick a good team.
Advice: Every manager joining Shell should be trained by Shell's way of treating their employees, which is with care and respect for the employees.
Pros: Shell is very much people-oriented. As an employee, you can shape your career as you desire. You can engage with other people, determine where you are looking to develop, and then go after these areas. Very accommodating overall. Good salary and benefits.

Cons: Lots of unproductive compliance and occasionally overzealous Health & Safety - well-intentioned but sometimes extreme. Need approvals for everything - very slow. HR actively prevents the best people from doing the right jobs for them.
Advice: Unleash the potential of your people, allow the best people to work in jobs that suit them. Always aim to improve work efficiency, not increase compliance.
Pros: People are mostly intelligent, friendly and capable. Plenty of interesting and challenging work to do, while maintaining good work/life balance.

Cons: For those more senior in their career, and ambitious to take on more responsibility, Shell will be frustrating as non-quantiative factors weigh in much more heavily into promotion decisions than talent, ability to succeed, proven skills, etc.
Advice: 
Pros: Shell offers excellent opportunities for growth early in your career, supports employees in moving to different roles to develop skills and can offer some international opportunities for those interested.  Shell is serious about training and development, and there are numerous internal networking opportunities.

Cons: I could not fine any cons. I am a people person and I believe in helping when asked or if I see that help is needed,
Advice: Connect with your team. Get to know them, everyone is different.
Pros: You continue to learn about the business, the employees, management are great people to work with.  During the 30 years I have work in a lot of department and all where great areas.

Cons: Various parts of the company can lack strategic direction.  Stategy can come in the form of re organization rather than understanding how you can drive effeciency with current structure.
Advice: Keep implementation of new ideas minimal and involve those who are responsible for execution
Pros: If you are mobile, dedicated, and have a good head on your shoulders the opportunities are wide.  Pay and benefits are top notch.  Ability to develop relationships are critical to success.

Cons: surrounded by mediocre co-workers, below industry standard compensation, not an environment that fosters your best efforts and ideas.  this is a place to coast into the sunset
Advice: need to reduce the staffing levels to keep the best and the brightest.  pay for top talent.  reduce the bureaucracy.  stop making decisions by committee
Pros: job security, not overly demanding, great hours, decent benefits, able to leverage the oil giants brand recognition in the marketplace

Cons: Middle management is not decisive and does not take an active interest in developing people. Appears to bungle the strategic vision of Senior Management.
Advice: Make more of an effort to be proactive in managing careers. Even highly rated employees end up being ignored at times since everyone is "too busy" focusing on the day-to-day. Ends up hurting long term performance of the company.
Pros: People are generally good to work with at your level. Senior Management has a clear goal and is very proactive strategically.

Cons: The worst part about working for any oil and gas business is the impact of layoffs when oil prices drop for an extended amount of time.
Advice: I have had the chance to work across so many of these businesses and thank Shell for every bit of experience.
Pros: There are many opportunities available in the business from Refining to Deepwater and now to Energy.  Global business in many locations around the world with our headquarters in Netherlands.

Cons: Manager rotten to the core, violated every single discrimination, including race, gender, sexual orientation. Complained by multiple people for harassment, yet HR failed to take proper action, the manager even got promoted with big raise. Half the team lost their faith and left the company.
Advice: Don't buy into the corporate values mumbo jumbo, managers don't lead by example. If you face harassment, don't bother to complain to HR, because HR will only protect the managers, not you.  Complaining will only lead to retaliation, even though HR tells you it is not allowed, don't believe it.  Essentially, your career will be gone.  Best is to move to another company, and don't wait too long like me.
Pros: Good money, many good people

Cons: Shell has a lot of bueracracy that has to be navigated each day. There are a lot of divisions in the company that seem to make projects a lot harder than they should be.
Advice: There needs to be more done to encourage integration between the various teams involved in the same play/project.
Pros: Plenty of training oppurtunities, very good support for new grads. Support from managers to work on projects that intersest you. Good pay, good bonus supported for everyone even in middle of oil price crash.

Cons: stagnant career paths at times people don't seem to recognize true talent when they see it; low entry level pay is somewhat of a dealbreaker for smart kids trying to get in
Advice: Keep it close to the belt and keep taking it with a stride at a time; let us know more frequently what can be done to further the progress of SHELL
Pros: Great culture with strong emphasis on innovation and forward thinking. Management really helps lower levels with their work and everyone chips in making it a real group effort

Cons: Commercial decision making process needs work. Fail to follow structured Gate System and mega projects are all over budget and off schedule. Highly nepotistic and HR system is fundamentally corrupt. Difficult to have a conversation about sticky issues without being retaliated against. Ethics group also corrupt.
Advice: See your group's performance as a reflection of your own performance.  Promote based on work delivered and skills. Many times discrimination blatant and obvious. You are not God and don't rule the world to judge people from a distance.
Pros: Good focus on research and development, willing to take risks, trim unnecessary processes, and can be very transparent. Strong technical people. Flexible work schedules.

Cons: Most times your left alone while other employees are hiding off camera. If you can manage 2 registers at once, you'll do fine!
Advice: Make sure that all the work does not fall on one employee be sure to pay attention to what your employees are doing and which ones are working harder than others to cover the slack. Other than that management is fine.
Pros: Boss is extremely flexible and helpful, has no problem letting you take sick days and is very understanding probably the best boss I've had it any job!

Cons: - Company may choose to keep or install less than adequate equipment.
Advice: Thank you for always being flexible and fair on your end to allow a great work/life balance.
Pros: -Training with fellow employees is respectful and thorough.
- Company provides great work environment and tools needed to do the job.
- Pay is equitable and benefits are substantial 
- Good work/life balance
-Management is fair and flexible
- Personable staff that will go out of their way to help you if needed.
- Safety is priority for hourly, staff, and contractors.

Cons: There are terrible people to work FOR. Advancement is based on who you know and how much you "deliver", even if what you deliver is only the minimum to move things along. This is how bad managers are able to become managers.

For a company that claims to be innovative, it is sadly behind the curve. No one really wants to improve processes or be revolutionary, they just want to get things done. 

Don't expect special career or development opportunities unless you are a "chosen one."
Advice: Get away from group think. Stay true to your message of diversity and appreciate diversity of thought.
Pros: Pays well and there are some great, intelligent people to work with. Peers are really what made work bearable.

Cons: As with many large multinational corporations, its sometimes difficult to get a feel for and understand all the integrated aspects of how the overall Enterprise functions.
Advice: Keep extending the limits of what is possible!
Pros: A progressive multi-national that understand and values the diversity of its employees! A company that actually lives it's corporate values which insures all its employees have the opportunity to achieve their highest aspiration and dreams! A courageous company that dares to reach for what other companies in the Industry typically feel is the impossible...

Cons: In a battle for cost reductions, no job is secure. Employee loyalty is expected but not reciprocated. Much discussion about cost reduction instead of revenue generation. Both are important.
Advice: Identify the traits you so desperately seek in employees, I.e., loyalty, honesty, commercial mindset, and assure the company practices them first. This will encourage tenure of younger workers where turnover rate is high.
Pros: Opportunity to work globally, impact lives through support of energy industry, complete projects that are massive in scale, manage large teams and budgets, see the world.

Cons: Limited options for advancement and management doesn't want employees to leave the site
Large and demanding workload
Slow decision making process and large bureaucracy
Complex and ineffective work processes to accomplish tasks
Advice: Better leverage the talent that is on site and provide more job development opportunities for your employees.  
Develop ways to get new employees opportunities outside of the refinery and into the larger organization.
Pros: Good pay and benefits
Quality department teammates and mentors
Good work environment, everyone works well together
Everyone always tries to do the right thing

Cons: They reorganize often, going from regional leadership to functional leadership and back.  Every time there is a change in top leadership, they reorganize and often make people post for jobs. This can be really stressful for all employees.
Advice: None
Pros: They honestly try to do what's best for the employees
As an HR person, I was surrounded by top HR people.  Like any place, there were some not great HR people, but they really invest in training and recruiting to provide the best possible support

Cons: NO work/life balance in IT positions, bureaucracy at its worst, things take forever to get anything done, leadership fluctuates back and forth between business models every few years, resulting in constant layoffs and rehires.
Advice: Your "streamline" processes adds more work for everyone.  Stop changing your mind on the direction of the company every few years.  Morale was terrible when I left the company.
Pros: Great Pay, good work/life balance depending on the group, great training, will pay for your MBA which is really nice, amazing retirement benefits

Cons: No real job security, constantly applying every few years for a new job internally, when in field expected to work much more than 40 hrs/wk, a lot of big company bureaucracy and meetings
Advice: Look out for your good people, don’t lose valuable people due to short term lack of opportunities
Pros: Excellent pay, great benefits, a lot of freedom to apply internally for new jobs and explore different areas, most people are treated well or as equals even if different hierarchally

Cons: No Cons and everything is almost fine i am only looking for a new job as the contract is about to finish .

Pros: great company with terrific long term benefits

Cons: Buddy system is prominent.  If you aren't in the circle then its curtains for you.
Advice: Enforce parity among operators.  When operators arrive tardy or intoxicated, counsel them.  When their peers see them being reprimanded and recorded in their file it will raise morale.

There's a lot of really good stuff going on at Shell.

Cons: Everything is slow at Shell, there is a lot of inertia. The news don't get communicated fast enough from the upper management to the employees.
Advice: Very isolated, there are several departments doing the same work but not communicating with each other, leading to a lot of redundancies
Pros: It is the safest option to work in a research position at Shell at oil downtimes and you can enjoy significant independence at the work place. The salaries are quite competitive.

Cons: it is the perception that Sr. Mgmt and HR are not always honest in the decisions made.
Advice: They need to be more transparent and make decision more quickly.

Cons: Decision making is slow, many corporate re-orgs
Advice: Continue to challenge the status quo and lead environmental change for society
Pros: The people you work with make work truly enjoyable. Shell doesn't just preach sustainable energy, they are implementing it. Truly the most societally conscious of the  Oil &amp; Gas majors. The work is challenging and rewarding. It is very hard to get fired (you have to do something extremely wrong).

Cons: constant change, each support department (IT, HR, Finance) is outsourced
Advice: When migrating business support services away from Hub locations, there is an indirect cost of reduced productivity to engineering staff and technical support teams that must now fill in the gaps on these support services which they were not primarily hired to do. This should be considered as well as bottom line overhead charges for support staff.
Pros: great people, excellent learning opps, challenging work, supportive networks

Cons: 401k match is terrible for new employees. Lack of direction in a huge bureaucracy makes it difficult to get things done efficiently. Consistent lay-off environment creates too much stress and distraction for employees.

Pros: Great work/life balance and pay

Cons: Constantly re-organizing. Many employees have to reapply for their jobs. Many lose their jobs. American employees are viewed as too expensive and are often replaced by expats. Career path is adhoc based on jobs you can find for yourself

Pros: Good pay and benefits. Get every other Friday off

Cons: Hard work and very long hours. Worked late nights and weekends, pay didn't equal amount of work. Takes a while for bonus/promotion, but is worth the wait

-Compensation
-Benefits
-Vacation

Cons: It is difficult to get things done that do not follow the norm.

Advice: Continue communicating with staff as often as possible, it's greatly appreciated. Additionally, work on creating the energy that was around a few years back.

Cons: I was informed, during a two year extreme harassment and "online shame" campaign, formal retaliation has been taking place by the IT department through vendors and strategic recruiters/IT contingent workforce suppliers. The attackers claimed I had reported a boss for "harassment" (implying sexual harassment). I had made a report about a boss changing names on important documents. It handled well by the company at the time.

 I wound up leaving the company a year later, definitely NOT because I was pushed out, but because it was time to stretch after 15 years. What I found out really happened was systematic blacklisting at new jobs by IT leaders on a reactive and false premise that I had made a harassment claim to the company. I recall the benevolent warning from a contractor (military background) working with security risk teams about Shell using the vendors and third party partners to do the blacklisting. This ultimately became true, yet it also indicates the IT security and risk organizations are well aware of what they are doing by using category /suppliers this way.

One recruiter tried to negotiate my salary down WELL below market value, while two organizations were just odd I had worked with and I wondered why the tone had changed suddenly to very hostile.
Advice: Consider the chilling effect of retaliation which can result in individuals not making the right reports about ethics and safety issues. Further training for IT management on anti-retaliation policy. In depth review of the practices of the IT strategic recruiters, information security information sharing consortiums, and suppliers /consulting firms regarding both their privacy (I was digitally stalked) and anti-retaliation practices. Ratings were five star, yet now I have learned a lot after a severe incident and deliberately (possibly funded) harassment campaign.
Pros: Company was extremely committed to ethics, the environment, innovation and betterment of it's people and community most of the time I worked there. Something has changed.

Cons: I worked in the Lubricants division and I have reason to believe the rest of the company is much faster and more competent, but what I saw in the lubricants division was truly sad.

- A slow moving machine. I have never seen an organization as sluggish as this one. There is little motivation to change things and make them any faster or better. Some departments are full of people who have been in "Lubes" since they started working and they are just riding it out until retirement 
- Little sense of urgency: if you think General Motors was a bureaucracy, or that the DMV is a slow place, wait till you get to Shell Lubes. 
- IT systems that are not suited for modern working. The IT team is effectively useless. You are better off looking for solutions from friends than by calling the Helpdesk. Any suggestions for simple software upgrades are met with stiff resistance
- Under-utilization of talent: there are some talented people stuck in dead-end jobs here, basically wasting away. The mega-talented ones find a way out. 
- Very little diversity at the top: mostly just the usual straight old white male cowboys. Imports (from Latin America) are almost invariably white South Americans. Other imports to the top of the organization are white Europeans. At the bottom, it's a good mix, so the organization can make good claims about diversity. If you're a US-minority, it's unlikely you will get close to the top here: that's what drove me away. 
- Overstaffing: it is not an exaggeration to say that a good 20% of the team is pure fat: they can be trimmed without an impact to the organization

Cons: You can really feel the budget cuts in term of manpower allocation. 1 person handling 2 roles are becoming common and norm.

You cant make a person covering several person task while still keeping the structe and expectation of coming with extra things and participation as if the person have alot time and should work and think about work all the time

- Health insurance/package does not cover dental and eye care

Cons: Shell SA is a bureaucratic environment that is very slow to adapt to their ever changing market environment. The company is filled with a lot of bullies who get ahead because of who they know rather than on merit. If you are not a yes man here you won’t fit in and you will feel the wrath of the bullies who are trying to maintain the negative status quo at the expense of true meritorious progress. Their HR is a joke and co-conspirators with these bullies. Confidential information always finds its way to the accused. I am glad I left this rabbit hole.

Most of the time these departments and opportunities are pure garbage and are of little relevance to the future, your career trajectory and the company's bottom line. RIP skills. 

Because they just throw you wherever (and at little notice) this translates to you likely not having any experience working in the specific function, and at the same time you will not be supported/mentored to do the job correctly. I have been regularly working overtime and weekends without getting paid and I do not feel like I am getting any skills or experience, so I am hoping to leave soon.

Advice: Not the company it used to be, obsession with offshoring and bogging down the function with endless social responsibility prequalifications in pre-award makes the function slow, cumbersome and unable to adapt quickly to changing business needs

Advice: None
Pros: Great work life balance and challenging projects

Cons: Busy month-end activities where overtime is expected (though this is common for finance departments even in other companies)
Cost-cutting (depends on which department you are in), therefore automation is encouraged which could also mean downsizing
Annual salary increase is low and even if you are promoted, increase is still low (around 8-10% only)
Base salary compared to other BPO companies is relatively low.
Promotion takes time - each employee has a 4-year window in their current role before they can be promoted. You can be promoted within 1-2 years if you have an exceptional talent or skill, or if you are a lead's favorite.

Cons: - Bad trainings - there is not a structured training, onboarding pack has limited information. A lot of pressure to achieve an high performance even when you are not trained accordingly. - Meetings with your TL feel like you are being in a room with KGB. After 1.5 months of working, with limited training, you are already told that your contract might not be renovated. Destructive Feedback with a goal to intimidate and not to teach or help improving. - Most of the time the meetings would be conducted not only by a TL but also by one of the seniors, who has been made senior through "politics" as it is not possible to pass from a junior to a senior within 2 years. Several other colleagues with very high scores took that amount of time to pass from a junior to an analyst. It felt like the TL needed some help passing the message or was trying to use an extra hand to intimidate. If you defend yourself they ask you for proof like if you are lying. - Toxic and stressful environment to work as your jobs is constantly micromanaged not only by the TL but by other older colleagues. -TL yelling during meetings and sending emails saying you are making other people uncomfortable in the team with no explanation to why. - Lack of appreciation for the work you put in and extra hours. These are not even paid.

Cons: Complexity: Shell scripting can become complex, especially for handling intricate tasks or dealing with large codebases. Managing dependencies, error handling, and edge cases can add complexity to scripts.

Limited Graphical Interface: Shells primarily offer a text-based interface, which may not be as intuitive or visually appealing as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for certain tasks, especially for users accustomed to graphical environments.

Steep Learning Curve: Learning to use a shell effectively, especially for beginners, can have a steep learning curve. Understanding command syntax, shell scripting concepts, and mastering various utilities and commands may require significant time and effort.

Security Concerns: Shell scripts can introduce security vulnerabilities if not written carefully. Poorly constructed scripts may inadvertently expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to system resources.

Platform Differences: While shell scripts are often touted for their portability, there can still be differences between shell environments on different operating systems (e.g., differences between Bash on Linux and macOS). Ensuring scripts work consistently across platforms may require additional effort.

Debugging Challenges: Debugging shell scripts can be challenging, especially for complex scripts. Limited debugging tools compared to higher-level programming languages can make identifying and fixing errors more difficult.

Performance Overhead: Some shell scripts may have performance overhead compared to compiled languages or more optimized scripting languages like Python or Ruby, particularly for computationally intensive tasks or large-scale data processing.

Maintenance Overhead: As shell scripts grow in size and complexity, maintaining them can become challenging. Ensuring scripts remain up-to-date, adapting them to changes in the environment or requirements, and managing dependencies can all contribute to maintenance overhead.

Dependency on External Tools: Shell scripts often rely on external utilities and commands, which may vary in availability or behavior across different environments. Managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility can be a concern.

Limited Error Reporting: Error reporting in shell scripts may be less informative compared to higher-level languages, making it harder to diagnose and troubleshoot issues, especially for novice users.

Despite these drawbacks, shell scripting remains a powerful and widely used tool for system administration, automation, and other tasks. Understanding these limitations can help users make informed decisions about when to use shell scripts and when alternative approaches may be more appropriate.
Advice: None
Pros: Efficiency: Shell scripting allows for automating repetitive tasks, saving time and effort. Once scripts are created, they can be reused or scheduled to run at specific times.

Flexibility: Shells provide access to a wide range of utilities and commands, enabling users to perform various tasks like file manipulation, text processing, system administration, and more.

Customization: Users can customize their shell environment to suit their preferences and workflow. This includes configuring aliases, setting environment variables, and choosing from a variety of plugins and themes.

Portability: Shell scripts are typically platform-independent, meaning they can run on different operating systems with minimal modifications. This makes them versatile for deployment across various environments.

Integration: Shells can be integrated with other tools and languages, allowing for seamless interaction with external programs and APIs. This makes them valuable for system integration and orchestration tasks.

Accessibility: Shells provide a command-line interface, which can be more accessible for users who prefer text-based interactions or those working on remote servers without graphical interfaces.

Learning: Working in a shell environment helps users develop valuable skills in command-line usage, scripting, and system administration, which are highly sought after in many technical roles.

Community Support: Shells like Bash have a large user base and extensive documentation available online. This makes it easier to find help, tutorials, and resources for learning and troubleshooting.

Scalability: Shell scripts can be simple, one-liner commands or complex scripts handling intricate processes. This scalability makes them suitable for tasks of varying complexity.

Low Overhead: Shells typically have low resource requirements, making them lightweight and suitable for use on resource-constrained systems or in environments where efficiency is crucial.

Overall, working in a shell environment offers a powerful and versatile toolkit for managing systems, automating tasks, and interacting with computers in a streamlined and efficient manner.

Advice: None
Pros: Work-life balance and safety policy.

Cons: The company keeps promoting people for the years of stage inside the company, rather than looking for skills and attitude of the candidates.
Advice: Look for talents and stop foolish the internal job seekers with the fake roles you post on work day, while the majority have " preferred candidates" without any fair competition - this is against what the company promotes on equity and fairness.
Pros: The company praise for the good atmosphere and DEI policy works quite efficiently.

Cons: The management have been there for a while, heavy Friday pub culture which is the only way to build relations and move up. 

Management are all from one age group bracket and demographic, including social class so it’s hard to relate if you’re anything different.
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay, opportunity, the offices are nice.

Cons: 1) Shell have a disappointing habit of hiring serious and successful professionals from the sector and then dis-empowering them. It is very hard to succeed with the combination of clunky IT, overly heavy process that crushes innovation, and deep layers of politics to navigate. 

2) Toxic environment created in electricity trading department. One red flag was when a very senior person said “people without mortgages are of no interest to me”. The implication was worrying and intimidating, with the behaviors displayed in the months to follow confirming the fears.

3) I was threatened and indirectly accused of intending to steal IP on the phone the day I resigned, by the same senior leader. It was a very upsetting way to finish my role and justified my decision to resign before securing a new role to move to yet.

4) The toxic management style lead to high stress, not conducive to innovation, happiness, or success. Not how forward thinking organisations should think about leadership.
Advice: Leadership change needed. The very senior management should note the obvious red flags and take action to remove dangerous senior staff members. Make a serious investment in IT. Foster a culture that allows your stars to demonstrate their excellence. Make a proper commitment to decarbonisation.

- The company's values, such as diversity and inclusion, seem to be meaningless, and no one seems to care about your opinion. 
- Work-life balance is just a catchy phrase that does not exist.

You get cheated in the term, because when you join your eyes are on the salary and you pay little attention to the job group. Where as the job group is your LIFE in Shell. Once set it is IMPOSSIBLE to revise, forget about the blabla of it is possible, it is not. To move from one job group to another you need 3 to 4 to even 5 years in a job (mostly 3), if you get cheated you'll never make it to any top position, because there is an even worse thing whicih is the estimated job group at retirement, even tah gets assigned, you have NO say, so for minorities and women the estimated JG at retirement is set at maximum 3, which means never reach any position of value. Shell is only for the English and Dutch and fellow white anglosaxons. Don't believe me? go waste a couple of decades of your life in Shell to find out.

Cons: I have worked for a few of shell retail Franchises over the years and there pretty much all the same. You are on your own for 99% of your time and expected to do the work of 3 people for basic wage (no extra for nights). New starters are left on there own far to soon with only the bear minimum of training and just expected to know what they are doing. One of Shells mottos is Go Home Well, 9 times out of 10 you don't. Summary Salary = Minimum wage ( cash loses come out as well) Benefits = NONE Management = Do the best they can (Franchisee in control) Job work-life balance = If you can get set shifts you will be ok, but good luck with that. Job security = If you show up you will be ok. Advancement = You can ask then ask again still will not get you anywhere. Job culture = Bad ( If by chance any one from shell retail upper management reads this, Please look more closely in to your Franchise's ) In all honesty if you go for a interview just ask these 2 question's, what is the the hourly rate and if it lone working. If the answers are Minimum and yes walk away.

Advice: None
Pros: Employer friendly, good compensation, and yearly hike.

Cons: No specific cons to mention
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing place to work and great learning opportunities

Cons: Below market starting salary, there is no way to play catch up no matter how good your performance is as it the same increment throughout the same grade you are at (L5 to L9). Can be demoralizing during the first few years. Some experienced hires with less than 3-5 years experience (no panel) already higher basic than those working for over 10 years.
Advice: Stop the same grade pay increment, incentivise those that are of higher performance. Imagine a slacking &gt;20yrs experience tech getting the same increment as a &lt;5yr tech who give it all. Over time, people will just start to slack since there is no incentive to perform at all and all will get the same pay increment.
Pros: good salary and benefits + high OT rate

Cons: Single manned garage where everything is your responsibility in that shift, things go wrong on the daily and you have 10 other moving parts of the day you are trying to deal with at the one time, customers, the pumps needing ok'd, the coffee machine needing topped up, delivery's coming in and needing put away, health and saftey for everyone on site. It is alot for one person and causes you alot of stress. I also didn't get any breaks or could barley go to the toilet on an 8 hour shift, you are also expected to stay on if the next person doesn't show up regardless of what you have going on in your life. I really did dislike working here. Also you have to work Christmas and new years day.
Advice: Do away with 24hr single manned garages and check in with your franchise owners to see how they are doing, also a direct link to shell for staff would be beneficial as sometimes they feel they have no where to turn too if other routes fail.

Advice: None
Pros: I worked at Shell in London

Cons: big company and good benefit
Advice: None
Pros: nothing to say. all good

Cons: Shady organization. The company's communication leaves much to be desired, often operating in a rather opaque manner. Decisions are made with a strong influence from individuals with backgrounds in the oil and gas industry, which do not align with the goal of fostering a cleaner future. Furthermore, a recent shift in strategy has led to the unfortunate situation of letting go of talented professionals recently hired from the renewable energy and decarbonization sector. Going in the wrong direction of the world!
Advice: Respect people. Change in the strategy means change in people's life, the minimum you should do is clear communication. HR contact is an automated email with machine responses. Avoid hiring employees only to reverse decisions shortly afterward. This company needs to treat both its employees and the environment with greater respect.
Pros: Salary and financial benefits are the only pros.

Cons: Manager controls most of your life
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Great work life balance and benefits

Cons: - Promotion takes a lot of time for quite a lot of folks and at times you need to keep pushing for it, which is very annoying. Everyone gets similar feedback from Line Managers saying you need to improve your visibility other than the work you do. - Salary structure could be better. Very little scope for saving on taxes - Some people get Market Correction on their CTC while others don't
Advice: - Please make the promotion cycles shorter and - Discriminatory Market Corrections are demotivating for other deserving candidates who don't get it. - Bring in more flexibility for people to move to different roles from IT to Business or vice-versa - Please improve the salary structure, so that in-hand could be improved. On Paper it looks inflated while in-hand after taxes is nowhere near - Please allow employees to jump to a different range of salary in the same job group
Pros: - Good work-life balance - Large organization so there are opportunities to move around, but mostly within IT - With leadership drive to shift towards a product mindset, Application delivery teams have autonomy and they work very closely with the business

Advice: Start care about your employees. Stop discrimination: for example I've made a check from 15 promotions for one month that I was informed 12 were for polish guys 2 for polish speakers and only 1 for foreigner. On my exit interview I told to the HR that if I quit and after 1 month apply for manager they will agree to sign me , but they do not agree at the current moment to make an offer and the HR representative agreed with this and said that it is totally possible having in mind my background.

-Good salary
-Good peers

Cons: Little career advancement opportunities, especially in the technical space. People who perform well typically get stuck in their role with poor reasons given not to promote them. Prefer to bring in expat than promote locals who are more than qualified. Fast career progression depends on who you know, even if you are not a performing employee. Salary package is good for the role, but not for the years of experience. People with tons of experience are unable to move up the career ladder. HR is blind to all these as they are only concerned with benchmarking for the role.

A lot of the system issues don't have a permanent fix, only temporary work around. Customer Service department for MY has a high turnover rate.

Pros: Work life balance Career development

Cons: Talent policies can get very messy. While it is true that having a strong network will improve your chances for promotion, there is a trend of promoting people of low ability. In fact, being capable would limit your growth. Toxic individuals who are part of the circle are constantly promoted. Rest are taken for granted. Performance reviews are 100% subjective.

Terrible working environment for staff, expected to work 8 hours with no breaks as most sites are lone workers. If you paid well and looked after your staff we wouldn't have such a high turnover of staff. More support for managers trying to do there job while covering till shifts for staff sickness sometimes 16 hour days. No bonuses or incentives for staff or managers. Frustrating when we see good staff leaving because the pay is not enough.

Pros: Work life balance and empowerment

Cons: Heavy workload, a lot of legacy issues that you need to clean. Management always promote Continuous Improvement (CI) project and digitalization but no proper guidance given and simply wants the team to blindly do, in the end it is not sustainable. A lot of the hiring managers already have preferred candidate when they want to advertise a role which end up causing unfairness and favouritism because the candidate has been selected even before the role is being advertised or interviews are conducted. When questions being asked to the management, the answers given are unprofessional and not precise. Good and capable employees are being hold in the role for so long but bad and incapable employees are given with the chance to move quickly because managers dont want the 'bad weeds' to be in their team.
Advice: If management really look at capable employees as an asset to the company, make sure to brush up their skills and improve their knowledge by providing proper guidance/training and dont hold them in a role for so long just to ensure stability of the team. This excuse doesnt work anymore because people can feel if they are being valued or under valued. People can be streched but  if they are being stretched too much, they will be broken. Eventually, you only have those bad/boot-licking/incapable employees in the company and the company will stumble.

Pros: Company understands work life balance and actually respects that. Company offers good benefits and perks for its employees. Company provides 2 way ratings between superiors and their subordinates. There are many opportunities in the company for professional development.

Cons: The other side of the coin of a high performing environment is that a competitive environment may also exist. It is up to yourself to take that as a positive challenge or not. Benefit wise - it is not as good as 5 or more years ago. Regardless, it is still among the best among other companies in the same industry. Finally, Shell has a tendency to overcomplicate things and making a lot of terms/phrase/jargon into abbreviations. It may take some time to familiarize with it.
Advice: None

- lip service and eye wash on targets &amp; values but no org. Or leadership actions or intent on adoption or ruthless drive to faster outcomes 
- people culture is overrated. Appraisal system on bell curve is just for the record but 80% in d center and rest 20% just above it. Seldom anyone is rated Lower. Mediocrity is standard. PIP is more headache and job risk for supervisors than reportee
- no respect for talent and value drive but exceptional efforts on retention of non-performance in the name of engage &amp; inspire. Haven for incompetent resources 
- extreme demotivation for people who are aspirational &amp; talented as growth stops after a while as executive positions are kept for outside India
- HR staff themselves misbehave and don't treat staff with respect and showcase insanity despite they being the face up for any org.
Advice: Pyschological Safety push is doesn't mean retain &amp; standardize non-performance. There has to be a metric for weighing a learners mindset. If this attitude and vision continues for IDT, it won't be long when eventually the whole IDT would be a white elephant with extremely unacceptable &amp; poor quality delivery to our business, resulting in outsourcing to d big IT service suppliers in d industry.

I agreed &amp; they agreed to pay me the language bonus of 3 months upfront &amp; remaining after one year if I get indefinite contract. I trusted them and agreed to all their terms conditions. But it was too late for me to understand that I'm was being deceived by managers with false promises of long-term contract. It was agreed internally already to terminate me in one year so that they can save the language bonus compensation. I never seen such an unethical company talking about ethics and zero-net emissions.

There is too much micro-management as a result. Assess your people properly for leadership positions, being a good specialist doesn’t necessarily qualify you to be potentially a good leader. If you need a reference of good leadership, there are great examples in T&amp;S Operations. You are losing great talent and will continue to do so because of inexperienced leaders. It might not look like it, but having people honouring their contracts doesn’t mean they are not looking outside. The Joburg office has a leadership crises!

Cons: Your experience depends on your manager. The one I was under with is biased and has preferred candidates because s/he referred them. Even if you work diligently and has good record than the new hires, s/he will push the new hires for promotion instead. Also, the heavy workload. Expect it every month-end and year-end. Be wary of a teammate who might talk behind your back. I experienced someone who is rude when I ask nicely and shared personal matters to the manager. Even going out with your closed teammates (who became friends) is a big deal to them. There is no boundary at all. Consider this position for experience. But expect that there is no work-life balance to it.

In simple words, If you have completed any work then in next second you have to go for advertisement of that work also otherwise you will lose your point🙂.

I haven't done the above so I got that result too, hope you learn from it and don't make the same mistake.

If someone is from Shell, they can co relate it to their own experience, and if I'm wrong you can correct me and share your thoughts too.
Advice: Management has to be fair, if an employee is putting his best effort then he deserves a good rating and result also. If the employee is not performing well and thinks that he is a hard worker then in that case also management have to tell him that you didn't do this work so you have to improve yourself. If the management is not giving fair feedback then the employee may feel disappointed by treating him/her as a great employee but with less than expected rating.

Cons: Working at this particular shell garage was awful you are overworked .worked on my own between 5pm and 11pm where I had to lock up by myself which was extremely worrying . Being on your own at work rush hour and having to cook work on tills watch the forecourt whilst people put their fuel in take fuel delivery's .if a pump stopped working ypu would have to go out and section it off leaving in one in the store .card machines constantly broke. Needed a manager to over ride things on till but there was never a manger on shift with . And being treated like rubbish by alitnif the customers this job took a toll on my mental health . This may just be for the particular shell garage i worked for so

Frequent reorgs benefit who are impacted as they get a chance to find higher roles.
Your line manager who doesnt take part in your day to day work assess your performance based on your visbility rather than delivery.
Overall No for people who are looking for career growth in tehnology but Yes for people who are BAs or are not successul in IT but have good networking social skills.

No appreciation &amp; recognition until you do something that saves them money.
It's been hell for me and for other as well. There's a reason there are around 40+ opening because people are leaving. Nobody wants to stay here.
If you put papers, they'll treat you like animals.
This is worst than many service based company. 
The pay grade is damn below the average.
If the HR is saying, you'll get lots of benefit, don't believe them that's a scam.
One you join the company there is nothing called as perks.

This is a sh** place to work for.
There is no career opportunity. Once you get in a team, you'll be there forever until unless you leave. No learning. Lots of favoritism.

Cons: With reducing the amount of staff, it is unrealistic to continue with the same gold standard service, but is not understood by HR leadership, or it is convenient to ignore it and rely on the hardworking staff to try and deliver to a very high standard, forgoing a good work/life balance.
After reorgs there is hardly any comms to people on who they work with now, you have to figure it out yourself, though the Outlook Addressbook. 
There is no comms on what to stop, start or continue to do after a reorg. Which means that junior people keep doing it all. 
The HR Chief Ronan Cassidy is not believable and out of touch. 
Staff in the service centres have limited growth opportunities, which means there is turn-over when they realise this.

Advice: KEEP IT UP!
Pros: Highly competitive. Inclusive working environment. Generous salary.

Cons: Leaders are horrible - they aren't classed as leaders but more like BOSSES! Very biased and racist leaders. They DO NOT care for their employees at all. Luckily John the so called CPO has left the company. Although his title says Chief People Officer, he is not at all a people person. Alec who is a so called Head of Comms, just doesn't know how to communicate with the business in his comms and ends up being very harsh in his articles that end up hurting employee's feelings (very arrogant and shrewd person). Managers on the floor as well aren't very great. If you're working for Shell Energy - you're just another number for them making them money. People don't last long there because the work culture isn't good at all. This place is filled with bossy and arrogant people. No scope for development. You will only get a chance to develop if you are good buddies with the bosses!
Advice: Appreciate your employees. If you do it - do it fairly. Help your employees to grow and develop. Don't tell them how to do their JOB - they are hired for a reason, instead give them tools to excel and grow in what they are hired for. Don't just sack people just because they don't agree with your way of thinking... Instead hear out and listen to their views - it will help you being open minded not narrow minded! By giving your employees a fair chance to grow it will not only benefit them but in the long run it will benefit your company. Happy employees = Happy clients and Great customer service + great company culture. Yes Financial goals are important however employees should be kept at the heart of anything you do (remember actions speak louder than words).
