Cons: I can't share any cons.
Advice: Great management!
Pros: Windows Operating System: Microsoft's Windows OS is widely used globally due to its user-friendly interface and compatibility with a vast array of software and hardware. Office Suite: Microsoft Office, including applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, is the industry standard for productivity software, widely used in both personal and professional settings. Azure Cloud Services: Microsoft Azure provides a comprehensive cloud computing platform that offers services for computing, analytics, storage, and networking, catering to the needs of businesses of all sizes. Developer Tools: Microsoft offers a variety of developer tools and platforms, such as Visual Studio, which are widely used by software developers for creating applications across various domains. Xbox and Gaming: Microsoft's Xbox gaming platform is popular among gamers worldwide, offering both consoles and a vast array of games, as well as services like Xbox Live. Innovation and Research: Microsoft invests heavily in research and development, leading to innovations in various fields, including AI, machine learning, and quantum computing. Accessibility: Microsoft has made strides in accessibility features in its products, focusing on making technology more inclusive for people with disabilities. Support and Documentation: The company provides extensive documentation, support, and resources for its products and services, making it easier for users and developers to troubleshoot issues or learn how to use the tools effectively. Security Measures: Microsoft emphasizes security, regularly providing updates and patches to protect its software from evolving threats. Business Solutions: Microsoft offers various business solutions, including Dynamics 365, which integrates customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) capabilities.

Cons: Training program doesn't really exist. You have to rely on the other members of the team to help train.

Too many vendors/contractors: some could consider this a pro, but Microsoft brings in so many vendors that the Critical Environment team doesn't really do anything complex or in-depth.

Growth: There isn't really a path to move up unless it's into a completely different field or becoming a people manager. There is no true technical lead position like at other data centers.

Culture: This one may seem odd, but Microsoft really got on their employees to donate during their "Give" month. Obviously it's for good causes, but it definitely felt like I was being forced to donate my time/money instead of having it be my own decision.
Advice: I would appreciate more direct communication instead of having to play telephone through my direct manager, specifically having you come directly to the affected employee instead of their manager for simple praise or admonishment.
Pros: Schedule: 4 12-hour days, 3 days off, 3 12-hour days, 4 days off all consecutive

PTO: 80 hours HHTO (Holistic Health Time Off aka sick time), 16 hours floating holiday, 80 hours paid holiday, accrue 120 hours PTO per year

Benefits: $0 medical/vision/dental premium for whole family, HSA, $1,500 Perks Plus reimbursement (for anything that improves your physical/mental/emotional health), 50% 401k match

Cons: Executive leadership seems to have become disconnected from employee's needs and reality. Can easily get lost in the noise of the company. You need to always be selling yourself to show impact and value. RIFs happen and can be large numbers and your impact to the business can be ignored.
Advice: Executive leadership always talking about leading with empathy, but they don't actually show empathy themselves. The 2022/2023 layoffs are a great example. Management dragged out the layoffs. Some L3 and up managers said "just be happy you have a job" or "have a backup job because anyone could be let go at any time". That should have never happened. There was little to no acknowledgement to the employees about the stress this caused them all while management continued to ask employees to do more with less while Microsoft showed record profits. I would like to ask Microsoft management to review the processes that they used for the last rounds of layoffs, talk to employees, specifically ICs, and change the process/policies to help reduce the stress that was caused to employees the next time this needs to happen. We all need to practice what we preach. If leading with empathy is something executive management wants to tell employees to do, then they themselves need to do that and be transparent with ALL employees.
Pros: Lots of different positions and opportunities. Good pay Good benefits If you are a good self-guided learner then you have lots of opportunities to learn and grow.

Cons: -The Baller years were not great -Technical training is an issue -MSFT will let you work as hard as you want so your work life balance can get out of whack. -Some people do not like the employee ranking system but that is often because its not understood, its not terrible, but the company can do a better job of explaining exactly how it works. - The RIF's are always rough but sometimes necessary
Advice: Focus on bringing back in person, instructor led training, we have gotten by with recorded online training but we need to be in a class with our peers and a teacher from time to time. Peers help hold one another accountable, instructors/teachers are there to answer questions and also help hold student accountable. When people are in class together they build out thier network and establish connections that will help us solve the worlds most complex problems.
Pros: Microsoft is a Technology company built by engineers from the ground up and designed to be run by engineers. (Gates) The company had a dark period under Ballmer, but that’s because he was not an engineer and did not fully understand how engineers think and what they respond to and it was reflected in the flat stock for more than 10 years. We now have an Engineer at the helm again in Satya Nadella and the company is back on track to continue to do great things. Pros: -Great culture -You get to work with really smart people -Decent Salary -Good work life balance -Good top level managers placing the right bets at the right times.

Cons: Microsoft like any big company works by the law of big numbers. If you hitch your wagon to a product that fails, you may find yourself on the layoff line despite personal performance. There is little to no effort to retain employees swept up in these broad reorganizations; each employee has to reapply to a new role on their own which often happens during a period of hiring freezes and uncertainty across the company.
Advice: Focus on *talent*.  We talk about impact, we talk about results, but we don't focus enough on the fact that someone's impact or results may be a side effect of not putting the right person, into the right job.  Nobody does as well when faced with something they're bad at or for which they have no passion, so why would we measure that?
Pros: There are few companies that cover as many industries as Microsoft. This means that you can spend an entire career, jumping from role to role, leveraging your experience at every step while never doing the same thing twice over decades.

Cons: 1. No decent way to submit formal internal complaints. 2. HR is outsourced and won't help you that much. 3. Low chance for promotion and upward movement. 4. Fired for nonsense reasons, with no warning previously, no chance for appeal. One day out of blue manager told me I was performing "well below minimum expect level", "cannot complete task independently", "do not respect company culture", "disrupt team environment", among other nonsense reasons. I have no formal channel to complain, manger's mangers (M2) doesn't take me seriously and say I lack respect for my manager's judgement. Next month I was terminated for performing well below minimum expect level and have no way to appeal. Left a message to CEO on Teams the day I left saying I have absolute confidence anyone I worked with, aside from my manager, will say I perform just as well, if not better than my coworkers. I know it doesn't change anything though. I would sue for wrongful termination, but I don't have money or energy to fight 10 years+ lawsuit with MS.
Advice: At least pretend to care about employees and not just empty talking all the time. For example, in 2022 CEO talked about doubling raises budget, but I end up getting only a 7% raise, the inflation is 7.5% plus that year. In 2023 there will be no raise at all, all I can say to that is LoL.
Pros: 1. Good company vision, value and culture, on paper at least. 2. Good benefits, promote a healthy lifestyle. 3. Compensation is OK too, at least keeps up with mainstream. 4. Most people are nice, for real, helpful and kind.

Cons: Even if you're not in a sales role, you're expected to sell the latest stuff...even if your customers aren't there yet. Also, while the culture is very employee-oriented, encouraging, diverse, and focused on work life balance and wellness, it can be very stressful due to the demand to produce new sales. And they have their own internal language (and acronyms that have 12 different meanings) that takes a while to adapt to, on top of the fact that their products and features change so rapidly (including their product names) it's almost impossible to keep up. So be aware...onboarding is like waterskiing without skis; you get dragged while hanging on for dear life.
Advice: You never really have figured out the customer success role. That is a long-play farming position, not a sales position. You count too much on customers not wanting to do the work to move from your platform and don't give them enough help to truly leverage your solutions through decent support. This will come back to bit the company eventually.
Pros: Microsoft has amazing products and services for enterprise customers, so many companies use them...creating a lot of opportunity. The culture as a strong learning mindset and encourages people to grow and try new roles, so it's always interesting and new.

Cons: Corporate Bureaucracy:

Potential for bureaucratic processes due to the company's large size.
Intense Competition:

High-pressure environment with intense industry competition.
Fast-Paced Culture:

Fast-paced work environment with demanding deadlines.
Work-Life Balance Challenges:

Challenges in maintaining work-life balance, especially during peak times.
Constant Change:

Rapid changes in technology landscape may require frequent adaptation.
Limited Autonomy:

Limited autonomy in certain roles, especially at entry levels.
High Expectations:

High performance expectations may lead to increased stress.
Communication Gaps:

Occasional communication gaps due to the company's size.
Rigorous Performance Evaluation:

Rigorous performance evaluation process.
Limited Remote Work Flexibility (varies):

Some roles may have limited flexibility for remote work.
Advice: None
Pros: Cutting-edge Innovation:

Engage in pioneering projects at the forefront of technology.
Global Impact:

Contribute to solutions with worldwide significance.
Career Growth:

Access extensive training, mentorship, and advancement opportunities.
Diversity and Inclusion:

Inclusive Leadership:

Experience transparent and inclusive leadership.
Social Impact:

Contribute to philanthropic and socially impactful initiatives.
Inspiring Workspaces:

Work in state-of-the-art facilities designed for creativity and collaboration.

Cons: Honestly in 3 yrs of working here, I have yet to find any cons.
Advice: Don't change a thing
Pros: Microsoft is one of the few companies that I have seen that actually lives up to the hype. They leave no doubt to their consultants that the customer must come first and that the customer privacy is sacrosanct. I feel perfectly free to recommend competitor products when it is in the best interest of the customer. I have never seen a company like that. They also make it clear that honesty and forthrightness is a minimum requirement. So if there are "warts" in a Microsoft product, I do not get in trouble for telling the customer, I am actually expected to forewarn the customer. I can't tell you how fantastic it is to work for a company that has this mindset. I have seen many companies that "say" these things but I've never seen a company back it up with their actions until Microsoft. And they couldn't be more supportive of their employees - incredible benefits, training, transparency, etc.

Cons: Health insurance while decent has a ridiculously high deductible for those outside Redmond. Senior management is clearly politically motivated and practices lip service when it comes to work/life balance and desire for diversity and inclusion. If you are of a particular category (in the US), you’re clearly being weeded out to help the company improve it’s look in the industry. Companies they buy are to either stifle competition, or to extend their beholden approach to anything. Then they rip the company apart very quickly thereafter. AI and automation is the future, all else be damned. They say the encourage lateral moves within, but clearly have their favorites and all others are ignored.
Advice: Treat your employees better. Don’t just say the words, take action. Go back to what made you a good company in the first place and stay out of politics, religious, and social issues. That’s none of your concern. Your world view is yours, but don’t foist that on ANYONE. You are guilty of the very thing you claim to be quashing - respect for diversity of opinion and worldviews.
Pros: I’ll say here what I’ve told colleagues elsewhere and family. “MIcrosoft pays me well for what I do.” The Perks+, the stock options and the 401K contributions were all appreciated.

Cons: The phrase "do more with less" is once again becoming toxic at Microsoft. First, it was do more with less, because Microsoft has been laying off people right and left — many of them totally unnecessarily. The work still needs to be done, but they just cut the teams doing it. My team was cut by 60% even though there is more work than before. Then, it was do more with less compensation, when Microsoft decided not to give raises to full-time employees (during high inflation, let's call this what it is: a pay cut). The, it was do more with less as Microsoft is reducing its budget for morale, equipment, travel, vendors, everything really. WLB has gotten worse. Compensation has gotten worse. Culture has gotten worse. Morale is the lowest I've seen in over a decade. And leadership appears not to care; worse, even to be daring people to complain, daring them to leave. It's not good lately.
Advice: Management needs to return to caring about its people instead of just shoveling money into AI partnerships. If they don't, then Microsoft is in for a MASS EXODUS when tech industry hiring starts to improve again.
Pros: There are still many good things about Microsoft. The compensation is fairly high (though not the highest), and the benefits are good overall. Many of my colleagues are smart, positive, helpful people.

Cons: If you were looking for a job that would support one or two customers, think again. You will be required to teach classes, travel on site with multiple different customers and constantly be on the prowl for more work. All on top of constant training (which is cool, but do it all on your time). The company has moved away from the traditional professional services concept and more towards an everyone is selling posture (think classes). It's thrilling if you are young or don't have a family. It's awful if you do have a family and are trying to maintain some semblance of a work-life balance.
Advice: Stop relying on Copilot for all your answers, it's a robot.
Pros: If you love chasing work and burning the candle at both ends, this is a great place to learn on the fly.

Cons: Satya's been telling Microsoft that our espoused values and actual values need to get closer in alignment for years: values including manage/coach/care, collaboration, nonviolent communication, reduction in toxicity, no more stack ranking. It's probably a lot better than it was - I missed the Ballmer years - but still feels like a competitive environment where people gossip about how much other people suck, screw them over to make themselves look good, hyperfocus on negativity, all while seeming pleasant and friendly on the surface. People don't say the words 'stack ranking' but they still stack (or bucket) rank.
Advice: Do away with performance bonuses. Even letter grades like in schools have been shown to be damaging to collaboration, feeling safe enough to take risks, willingness to work on hard problems. I, for example, have been burned by taking on a hard problem and only solving it "adequately." Claiming you want to create a collaborative culture and keeping that system intact is hypocrisy.
Pros: Really trying with D&amp;I, a metrics driven effort that really shows. My group is way more diverse than any other software industry team I've worked with.
They're trying to be less toxic.

Cons: If you're unlucky enough to get a manager who still practices the "old Microsoft" culture, leave immediately. HR will not help you, even if they state they're there for you as well as the company. I was laid off but prior to that I experienced a toxic work environment with my latest manager. Micromanagement and unrealistic or unstated expectations were the norm and the environment was fully abusive and toxic. I don't attribute this to Microsoft but specifically to my manager. I wish that HR had acted sooner to remove this manager as the company lost many employees due to the culture she created after a reorg.
Advice: None
Pros: The stated culture is amazing. Most of my colleagues lived this culture and were wonderful to work with. You're allowed a very long onboarding time to get acclimated to both the company as well as your new team and role. Nearly everyone is willing to schedule a 1:1 with you to help you either while you're onboarding or anytime you need help. It's a very supportive environment.

Cons: Like I said, depends on the team. In a top down approach, the core values at the top aren't always mirrored the lower you go. People are people and sacrifice these values for deadlines and metrics. Promotions aren't always merit based and there's an affinity for hiring people from outside who do not reflect company core values into management roles that they have no experience in. Also, while there are a lot of resources available, finding out about them is sometimes the hard part. I worked here for years without understanding how ESPP and 401k worked, how to go through the process of taking certifications (for free), and other perks that are available to all employees. While this is not the end of the world, you do have to be proactive learning about what amenities are available to you.
Advice: None
Pros: Hub is awesome. Certifications are free and there are resources available to advance your career, if you can find them and take advantage of it. Benefits are great, especially ESPP and 401k matching. Depends on the team, but usually people are nice, helpful and easy to network with. This is especially true across other teams, as everyone maintains a customer-first mindset.

Cons: Intense Competition: The technology industry is highly competitive, and this competitiveness extends to the sales domain. As a Sales Manager at Microsoft, you may encounter intense competition from other major tech companies. Meeting sales targets and securing deals may require significant effort and strategic planning. The pressure to outperform competitors and achieve ambitious sales goals could contribute to a high-stress work environment. It's important to be prepared for the fast-paced and demanding nature of the industry, as well as the need to adapt to evolving market conditions.
Advice: None
Pros: Global Impact and Prestige: Working as a Sales Manager at Microsoft offers the opportunity to be part of a globally recognized and respected technology leader. The company's products and services have a widespread impact, and being in a sales role allows you to contribute directly to Microsoft's success on a global scale. This can enhance your professional reputation and provide a sense of pride in working for a company that has a significant influence in the tech industry.

Cons: However, I also faced some challenges and difficulties during my time at Microsoft. I felt that the company culture was not very supportive or inclusive of its employees. I witnessed several layoffs that seemed arbitrary and unfair, regardless of performance or seniority. Working for Microsoft requires discretion and prudence in your communication and interactions with others. At Microsoft, I found out that career progression is not easy. They talked a lot about support and training for the next level, but I hardly saw any employees being promoted. I also felt that the lower and mid-level managers were not very effective or empowering. They often followed the senior leadership’s agenda without questioning or challenging it and did not stand up for their employees when needed.
Advice: You cannot provide advice to those who do not care to listen.
Pros: I worked at MSFT for several years and learned a lot from the company. MSFT has a lot of talented and passionate people who are working on innovative and impactful projects. The company also offers competitive compensation and benefits, as well as opportunities for educational development. Excellent benefits + fitness plan (Perks+). Some really great co-workers. Excellent technology and a great place for learning and continuing education. Promoted "work life" balance culture.

Cons: * There have been several rounds of layoffs late 2022 and Q1 2023. * You are encouraged to work from home as desk space is limited while new construction on campus is going on. * The company uses an open office work area. * You don't have even enough room to put a picture on your desk and it is noisy and hard to concentrate. * If you choose to work from home they do not reimburse you for internet connection or cell phone like other companies. * They have done away with accrued vacation and personal days and changed over to take time off as needed (flex time) "with manager approval" of course. * Several of use had just put in enough years to receive 5 weeks of vacation. Poof, gone! This is a way of saving money so when another round of substantial layoffs come along they won't have to pay out accrued vacation time.
Advice: You have done a good job of living up to the One Microsoft corporate policy so far. Please don't let that start to erode. Don't allow managers to layoff people after a reorg so they can get head count for a pet project. Or at least make sure they are accountable for their actions. Adopt an open door policy so employees can speak to their skip level manager when they have an issue that they don't feel is being addressed.
Pros: * Decent compensation. * Best Medical benefits compared to other multinationals. * Free Gym membership. * Work from home or remote is encouraged. * Stock is included as part of your compensation. * They will match charitable donations 100%

Cons: Yes, it is a big company. If there are any cons regarding this company they are, some of the typical things you deal with as a company of his size and influence. Sometimes things like strategies can feel a little disconnected as they are translated down to the front lines but in the end I have always felt supported in taking care of the customer. That is huge.
Advice: I have been blessed with some of the best managers in this company, so I unfortunately do not have much advice for them.  They stay out of my way and allow me to do my job and support me when I need higher level support.
Pros: Every year I am delightfully surprised of how great this company is. The way they take care of their people and foster a growth mindset is bar none.

Cons: There is a thick middle management layer that insulates senior leadership. The top and bottom layers don't talk to each other very well, if at all. Decisions get made without accountability being taken. "Corporate Culture" is something being fed to the newbies, but doesn't mean anything thing when business needs arise.
Advice: Management needs to understand the value of transparency and accountability. "The Business" doesn't do anything. It's people. People consume data, people make decisions, people take actions. Just own it. Don't shove your head in the sand and pretend things happen for reasons you don't understand. If there's lack of understanding and clarity around a decision, its only because management (or their superiors) don't wish for there to be. Everybody, at every level, should reject that kind of obfuscation.
Pros: I worked with tons of very smart people at the peak of their technical game. I don't think I could have learned more or done more in my specialty area had been anywhere else. Excellent opportunity to deepen my skillset and to learn some new things.

Cons: Microsoft feels very collegial and not in a good way. People who have been there for a long time call themselves "Softees". The top corporate leadership went to similar ivy league schools and have been there for more than 15 years, so they protect each other. It's very tough being a new manager to offer a different opinion, it's frowned on. They say they want people of diverse backgrounds to participate in introducing new ideas, but it's mostly lip service, since direct bosses will discourage it. Some bosses are frankly afraid, since they don't know anything else besides the "Softee" way. Microsoft works in a matrix leadership instead of a pyramid, which is unproductive and very political, since you most likely will not just have one boss, but a "skip" boss too that will compete to manage you. Middle management gets stuck in the middle, so it takes much longer to execute projects than it should be.
Advice: Get rid of the mesh management system with skip bosses. It doesn't work. Hire people from outside of the culture to help make the company progressive.
Pros: Microsoft pays well and has the best benefits that I've ever seen for any company, especially for health insurance.

Cons: The layoffs this year were pretty nerve racking, dental insurance (Premera) sucks if you need anything extensive done, but for the bi annual cleanings are free. Also Premera insurance does not cover weight loss Rx (GLP-1) without extensive “try other methods” for 3 months PA requirement, which many of Microsoft’s competitors policies do cover. If you read up on GLP and employer plans covering them, Microsoft’s weight loss coverage is pretty archaic (will cover bariatric surgery at $30k but not GLP-1 which studies have shown, the current generations are just as effective as bariatric without all the risks associated with surgery)
Advice: None
Pros: Challenging and Fun, great coworkers, pay &amp; benefits

Cons: The company eschews all other forms of technology except what they sell. The culture can be a bit smothering and long term employees move around inside the company because they understand the undercurrent of politics within the organization that I can only suspect that has been there for a very long time. It is rather cut throat, but not outwardly. Overall the various portions of the company vie to be in front of the customer as much as they can which drives how they are ranked and who receives the customer renewal money. It's an odd system that is now entirely arranged around their ARR.
Advice: In new portions of the organization, how and why do people that have been at the company 20+ years in a specific specialty end up leading and completely new one that they do not understand? When you acquire a new company, do it with the intention of actually integrating leadership from the new company into leadership at Microsoft.
Pros: Microsoft has extensive employee benefits and a lot of free learning opportunities.

Cons: -Stagnancy (easier to progress by moving outside the company vs. be promoted within) -Resistance to change (difficult to find teams willing to operate progressively or invest in truly radical ideas - still tends towards top-down strategy)
Advice: Under the leadership of Satya Nadella, the company has made significant strides on building a more inclusive culture that allows everyone to contribute the best ideas and collaborate effectively. There is still a significant disconnect between senior leadership (SLT) driving these messages and initiatives and the actual M1s and M2s driving these messages. Some of the same toxic behaviors that existed a decade ago are still present and the best I observed from some of the M1s and M2s was an ability to 'talk the talk.' A continued investment in transformation at the middle and bottom layers of the company will make the actual culture move closer to the aspiration.
Pros: -Culture (depending on team and manager, you can find strong inclusive and collaborative microculture at Microsoft) -Work life balance

Cons: 1. If your manager is not good, then your life will be horrible. Manager is the king. 2. They will put complete blame onto you even though manager does his side of mistakes, but only you suffer because of the 6 month reviews they provide 3. The Microsoft culture says about recognizing individual working style, be inclusive and all, but none of that would mean anything if your manager pins on the wrong side of all those things. 4. Not really good with work-life-balance either, the managers did not have any clue on how much it would take to implement a task and just push on pressure on every task I have had 2 really good managers though, but 2 horrible managers as well. With my 5+ years of FTE experience and 4+ years of vendor experience with Microsoft, I would say Microsoft has changed a lot after Satya came. You do understand that if the company does well for customers, then it means it would be horrible for employees right?
Advice: Please do not disguise or mislead your employees with all the culture BS if managers do not really follow them. All you want is pure business impact and so just be clear on that, so the engineers would not waste time on all those culture trainings.
Pros: 1. If you have a good manager, definitely your life will be good 2. Tons of learning resources, software and monthly $150 Azure Cloud credit 3. Excellent brand reputation as a Microsoft employee, outside of USA and outside FAANG companies.

Cons: - Behind in pay.
- Behind in raises for existing employees
- The benefits used to be world-class, but these days the don't cover anything real.
- They promote all the wrong people to leadership.
- Excessive outsourcing to India results in garbage quality unreliable products, ESPECIALLY internal tooling.
- Deadline-over-quality and bean-counting mindsets strong among management.
- All the "soft management theory" that made Microsoft unbeatable 5 to 10 years ago is gone now.
Advice: Tell Premera to cover stuff or you're going to dump them.
Stop promoting iPhone people to management roles.
Stop with the Indiasourcing of literally everything. You're getting scammed.
Pros: - You get to write "Microsoft" on your resume.
- Teams makes remote work simple.
- The stock has done well lately.

Cons: There was so many talks about special Microsoft culture. I didn't notice anything special at all. Even in start ups I felt more comfortable and had better team spirit. Management is a mess in Microsoft. No one really understand scope of taks, everything should be done yesterday. Manager tries to push down provided estimates and add extra work during the sprint. There's no budget to bug fixes. As results nothing is done in time and all blames goes to engineers. I worked for small start up and I know what is real pressure when the future of the whole company depends on the release. So I know what is hard work and I get used to work overtime. But in MS it's even worse, mostly because you efforts isn't recognized. MS culture promises life work balance and management pretend that they support this balance, but there's no such balance at all. MS push you to work overtime constantly, it's normal to work 12h a day and even on weekends.
Advice: None
Pros: 100% med insurance coverage for the whole family. Nice office if you use it. 401k 50% match.

Cons: The matrix is still challenging to navigate and does not always serve its intended purposes. Go deep to research the particular product/ business you are interested in joining. Ask what % of time is spent managing internal buy-in, meetings, etc. versus on customers, experimentation, and learning.
Advice: Improve the speed and rigor of decision-making around either scaling up or shutting down lower priority/ lower margin products and services. This has improved over the years, but there are still too many legacy or low-pri areas of the company that stagnate without urgency around an updated strategy or other clear action.
Pros: Great "deal" overall across the board. Leadership is still spotty in some areas in terms of making the transition from "know it all" to "learn it all" culture, but the progress is clear and the SLT is bought in 100%. Great talent and opportunity to move within the company for learning and growth.

Cons: Pay increase barely keeps up with inflation. Even if you have a killer year, won't really show that different on your bonus, raise. Pay just enough to keep you from quitting. Middle management is bloated to death, your manager has no idea what you do. They do nothing but posture and join useless meetings all day. My manager meets with me once a month so she can play pretend. Microsoft is no longer about solutions and is now about selling you things you don't need (where open source is a better choice). Technical consultants are a dying breed. If you're joining to grow your skillset in anything other than Azure, you're in the wrong place Bulls***t trainings that teach you nothing and are demoralizing and redundant Required certifications that are extremely difficult and teach you nothing Black box on how they decide bonuses (used to be a ranking system where there were empirical markers and now it's just a popularity contest) Require you do "extracurriculars" aka work outside work hours for free Money flows to the sales teams while those who work on the ground get the shaft
Advice: Focus less on pushing your expensive bloatware and instead focus on what's best for the customer
Pros: Very fair interview process where they care more about your potential than what you memorized in school Very laid back management (because they do nothing)

Cons: * Poor compensation, both in base salary and bonus/stock (USA might be a bit better than Europe, EU folks take a massive hit)
* Lack of challenging work for those with senior experience, most of the effort is repetitive (rinse and repeat).
* Innovative ideas or projects are rarely given light of day, especially within the Services orgs.
* Management lacks technical insight (on average) and is more concerned with self-promotion.
Advice: Connects are not a serious career plan/tool for ICs. Pay more attention to peer feedback as opposed to Connects.
Pros: * Excellent for entry to early mid-level career stage.
* Lots of data to analyze
* Decent variety of cybersecurity sub-fields to focus on.
* Great learning opportunity especially for early career stage.

Cons: A significant portion of DS managers do not have any management/ leadership training. They are suddenly thrown in to the driving seat to grow a highperforming team, and with no interest in properly nurturing a team, the whole culture crashes. DS managers waste time in meetings and showcase ideas, as their own; without involving direct reports who actually do the work independently working with internal customers. DS managers become risk averse and interested in only following the HIPPOs; rather than challenging inefficient leadership directions. They need to push back.
Advice: Do not promote everyone to manager track, just because they have interest. It's like sending your kids to a daycare with untrained, uninsured nannies.
Pros: Pay is decent; Work-life balance is quite good; (depends on the team) Interesting products.

Cons: A lot nowadays. The speak of culture but it is just lip service. The LT gives a preso on it but never is there any action items behind it. Seems a lot of new LT, managers that want to come in and change everything. Change can be good, but first learn the Microsoft processes before you determine it needs changing. Little to no trust in SLT, say one thing, does another. Unless you are a huge self-promoter, you will never go anywhere. Seems like 25 percent of the people, do the work for the other 75 percent who doesnt.
Advice: Betting the farm on AI is risky. There is a saying, if you treat your employees well, your employees will treat your clients well. Quit trying to hide the fact you manage out employees based upon someone's feedback that has an ax to grind. Managers are not qualified to be managers and the HR team sucks.
Pros: Every year the Pros are less and less, but what keeps most around is the medical benefits and perks.

Cons: Satya hasn’t really talked about culture since Jan 2020. The espoused culture and lived experience are VERY different. Who your Manager is means everything to your success and your career as a whole. Too much variation between leaders within and across orgs. Every man for themselves mentality. When you think you mattered, you’re really just a number. Everyone is very disposable. They will set cash on fire to lay people off than properly performance manage. Culture is sometimes what you can do to create a name for yourself to be recognized. Hired hundreds of people only to lay many of them off just a few months later. They will fix problems at no expense or money or your soul. Again, who you work for will dictate your success.
Advice: Fix your management culture. Everyone is often in survival mode and looking for short term glorification for the bosses to save their job. Stop massive hiring and massive layoffs as a lazy way to performance manage. Talk about culture more. Growth mindset. Stop giving managers who blame their issues on their teams a break. Hold managers accountable there are too many people skating by getting a free meal.
Pros: Nothing more I want than to write an amazing review about this company. They have all the potential in the world to be the greatest employer on the planet. They pay well. Good benefits at 0 cost. Exposure to an amazing tech stack. You learn transferable skills. Opportunity to interview for promotions but you’re on your own to fight for yourself.

Cons: Getting promoted is tricky. Many leave the company and come back to jump several times from where they were (call them boomerangs).

Job openings typically are filled by people who know the hiring manager and were already selected for the job (not what you know, who you know applies). Preference for hiring from the outside is rampant.

Golden handcuffs with benefits out of the world make it a very tough choice to look elsewhere.
Advice: Stay out of American and world politics.
Pros: Best benefits plan ever. As in fully paid medical/dental/vision insurance (no payroll deduction for entire family).
They spend lots of time and money on building and maintaining company culture.
Greatest minds in the industry to work with.

Cons: Position was eliminated very fast. I agree that companies must do what they have to in order to stay afloat but it is sad that even when you are doing well, tenure or results really do not matter.
Advice: Improved training is needed. The current training process is quite rapid and overwhelming right from the start. It would be advantageous to have high-achieving individuals within the organization provide instruction and demonstrate their best practices for a week at least. Too many changes and not enough people to help. Even the ones who are in charge of the change.
Pros: The company's culture, the impact you can have with the software, and the benefits stand out. The combination of benefits and work-life balance was exceptional. The company genuinely strives to create a comfortable and welcoming environment for everyone

Cons: Regular organizational changes. While it provided a lot of experience and you could get really good at your role, you may be moved to something different with a small window of notice. You can take skills with you and they are certainly transferrable, but it can feel challenging to know you're making a difference in your specific area.
Advice: None
Pros: We were tightly knit and could find resources quickly because our unit was so specialized. The culture was consistent with leaders that supported upward mobility in the company and would often provide connections if they felt you were fit to move on. Otherwise, they would help equip you to get to where you hoped to be, either with experience or opportunities.

Cons: -layoffs
-lots of red tape and processes that make it difficult to do your job
-leadership making decisions that impact recruiter's daily work (for example extra processes to post jobs, initiatives such as TIF that created a lot of extra work)
Advice: When making changes or creating new processes, articulate the reasoning behind why the new processes or change is so critical and then continue to measure the impact of the change over time.  
Pros: The people-lots of smart and driven people who pushed me to be the best i could be
work-interesting work and project opportunities
work life balance
good benefits and resources

Cons: - My work/life balance suffers even that I WFH, I often work 10+ hours a day,
- You career and raises depend a lot on your manager, if your manager is bad, don't fight for you and give you bad projects then you're screwed, I was lucky with my last 2 managers, but I know that manager is huge factor,
- Even when recognized for pushing extra hours my pay is not competitive compared to Apple, Meta, Google, and Amazon, it's way far behind,
- Senior leadership decided to invest in AI and acquisitions instead of raises for employees due to "global macroeconomic uncertainties" even that they pay is not competitive,
Advice: Everything is great except the pay. The pay for developers in Microsoft is far behind other big corporations. It's so bad that I'm considering throwing everything what's good in Microsoft away for a better pay.
Pros: - I'm surrounded by intelligent and respectful people,
- Some are very easy to work with and share knowledge when asked,
- Hybrid work and ability to WFH is amazing,
- I have a great manager (lucky me),
- A lot of focus on customer trust and security (morally correct path),
- Good insurance, - Good benefits (401k, ESPP, Perks+),
- MSFT recognized me twice when I was pushing long hours by giving me Special Stock Awards.

Cons: I was a huge Satya fan. But his leaders under him have lost their way. They talk about leading with customer first approach, but that is no longer the case. Back to the old days of we build it and industry will conform to what we build. The hiring of the VP for Services and his hiring of leaders over two years ago have yielded nothing. Zero direction from company leadership. All Accenture hires in UK, and nothing in feedback from any of them. So sad. I was a devote MSFT believer.
Advice: Start replacing your upper leadership. They are doing nothing. The hiring of the VP for Services and his hiring of leaders over two years ago have yielded nothing. Zero direction from company leadership. All Accenture hires in UK, and nothing in feedback from any of them. So sad. I was a devote MSFT believer.
Pros: Tech will continue to grow, so if you can manage to stay under the current leadership then you will make good money with stock benefits.

Cons: I was hired to solve customer problems but was terminated because I was critical of unethically pushing ChatGPT solutions to healthcare customers. The termination was remarkably sloppy, including lingering charges on corporate credit cards and threats to hit my credit. The contacts I was given to reach out for any issues were incommunicative. The company slogan is “One Microsoft” but corporate structure and incentives encourage a chaotic work environment where it feels like people are working against each other instead of with each other; it clearly manifested in poor management and product quality. Bonuses and stock options - a significant part of compensation - evaporated immediately after hire.
Advice: None
Pros: The clout and compensation were nice

Cons: This last year has been a bloodbath - lots of layoffs (both reported and "managed out")

At one point last year (July or August?) Open roles went from thousands to maybe 100 worldwide across all disciplines as they froze all non-essential hiring.
Advice: None
Pros: benefits are still very strong and pay is competitive (although not as high as other FANG elites)

Lots of different things to sink your teeth into

Good for opportunistic career ladder climbers who are good at socializing their impact

Cons: I joined News and feeds team at Microsoft with high hopes and enthusiasm, expecting a collaborative and supportive workplace. Unfortunately, my experience has been far from what I initially envisioned. The organization's leadership seems to lack the qualities of effective leaders. They not only micro-manage their teams but also create an environment that fosters toxicity and undermines employee morale. It's disheartening to witness the consistent favoritism and the tendency to gang up against certain team members. Such practices erode trust and hinder open communication, which are essential for any healthy work environment. It has become clear that the leadership's actions do not align with the values of fairness, respect, and professionalism that should be upheld. In conclusion, my time at Microsoft news and team has been marked by challenges stemming from leadership practices that hinder personal and professional growth. I hope that these concerns are addressed, and the organization can evolve into a more supportive and inclusive workplace in the future.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft is a good place to work for IF you team leaders are knowledgeable.

Cons: Compensation at the surface not competitive, leading to churns and difficulties of hiring at times.
Advice: Adjust base pay for all levels, otherwise leading to "job level inflation" to just to be competitive.
Pros: You can find almost any areas of interest without having to change company.
Community and environment awareness.
Cares more about employees compared to other big tech companies.

Cons: Microsoft's massive size can sometimes lead to bureaucratic processes and slower decision-making. Navigating the organization's complex structure might require extra effort to get things done efficiently.
Advice: Embrace change and be flexible in your approach. Adapt to evolving circumstances, whether it's changes in project scope, team dynamics, or market conditions.
Pros: From the beginning, I found Microsoft to be a place of substantial opportunities for growth. The learning resources available are quite comprehensive, providing ample chances to develop new skills and stay updated in a rapidly evolving industry. The company's emphasis on fostering a growth mindset is commendable, encouraging employees to take on challenges and continuously improve. The projects I worked on were engaging and impactful. Microsoft's influence on technology is undeniable, and contributing to its endeavors felt meaningful. Collaborating with colleagues from diverse backgrounds offered fresh perspectives and insights that enriched the overall work experience. Microsoft's work-life balance initiatives are notable. The company acknowledges the importance of a healthy balance between work and personal life, offering flexible arrangements and benefits that support employees' well-being.

Cons: work life balance needs improvement
Advice: readjust role responsibility to improve work-life balance 
Pros: Microsoft genuinely values its employees. Colleagues and leaders alike are approachable, collaborative, and genuinely invested in each other's success. The collaborative spirit at Microsoft creates an environment where people feel empowered to share ideas and work together to achieve common goals. Also, Microsoft's benefits package is truly exceptional. The benefits go above and beyond industry standards, from comprehensive health coverage to retirement plans and employee stock options.

Cons: I’ve been at Microsoft for over 10 years. There was a time where I looked forward to waking up and going to work. I felt the work was challenging and rewarding. My contributions were acknowledged and I was learning from my peers and leaders. Over the past few years, however, I’ve seen a drastic change in culture. Priorities change frequently and result in poor work life balance. Mid and low level managers are focused on empire building and promote extremely toxic culture. On top of this, the company had layoffs and stretched it out over many months, keeping employees extremely stressed about job security. We were told to work extra hard during this time, as if to prove we had some worth, and rewarded for that effort with more layoffs and the announcement of no raises. All of this is happening during record high stock prices. It feels that management no longer values its talent and is just chewing and spitting out folks who have worked long and hard to contribute to the success of the company.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft stock has been doing very well over the past few years.

Cons: Becomes very difficult to move from level 64 (Sr. Manager) to level 65 (Director). Highly political with many layers of oversight to get anything done, needing to go three layers up to approve internal decks and internal emails. Politics can create a highly toxic environment. Leaders pander to one another rather than doing what is right for the customer. Group Manager roles are a promotion in responsibility only, you double your responsibility and working hours with no additional pay until you can reach level 65. No guarantees that you will reach level 65 after working 70 hour work weeks. Certain teams have very little work life balance with a ton of expectation creating a lot of stress in the workplace. Operations are not available to support employees needs in marketing - can take up to 8 months to launch a marketing campaign.
Advice: None
Pros: Autonomy, budgets, remote work, opportunity to work internationally and have the ability to have multiple careers in one company. Great program for early in career

Cons: You are encouraged to move to a new role every 3 years. You are also expected to move up. So, even if you love what you are doing, you will be forced to move up and change. Great for some, not great for others. There is also a point where age + income + too many years at level or in role = role elimination which happens every few years.
Advice: Understand that your audience is 18 -24 months behind the stuff your talking about today. Go back and demo and talk about what they can use today, not just what is coming down the pike.
Pros: Great benefits and pay. Amazing people. Stock benefits. Top company for your resume. Great place to start your career.

Cons: Health insurance is a joke. They claim to have free health insurance just for your deductible to be extremely high. I couldn't believe my bill after leaving appointments. Layoffs have been brutal and even when they say you're safe, you're not. As they laid more people off, they just gave us more work until they were ready to get rid of us. But I guess it's still a business at the end of the day.
Advice: None
Pros: Pay was decent but the real money was in the commission. As long as you hit or surpass your quota, you will be making very reasonable pay. Perks+ and other benefits were great too and they covered our internet monthly. I was hourly so thankfully I didn't have to partake in Discretionary Time Off (DTO) and got paid out for my vacation. Flexible work-life balance and probably only went into the office 3 times out of my 2 years working for Microsoft.

Cons: I hate the review process as it feels arbitrary and, in some cases, its like a research project. It is also very inconsistent. My first manager had a slide deck where you had to research and fill in the values. Second manager basically said she does it off the communication notes. There is also a huge disparity in people's skill level. You would think being MSFT you would be with the best of the best and people who really know the platform, sadly not really the case. It turns out Microsoft ISD is like most places where you get good apples and bad apples.
Advice: None
Pros: Compensation package is great. Salary is competitive, though perhaps a bit on the low side - make 172k a year. Bonus last year was 30k and 48k in stock. Love the benefits, no charge for Health Insurance is awesome and the Perks+ stuff. You literally cannot find all of the benefits, people have spreadsheets to keep up with their are so many. The culture though is amazing. If you ever want a day off, you just need to ask. Teams are willing to help you and bend over backwards in an emergency. I love the people

Cons: Because my team was global there was no work-life balance. I tried hard to have boundaries, and carve out time for myself, but it was nearly impossible. Instant messages at all hours, expectations to respond immediately even at 10pm, and no way to effectively support that many executives within 40 hours.
Advice: None
Pros: Most of my coworkers were lovely people! I enjoyed that the company gives back and has a focus on philanthropy and volunteering. They also seemed to support innovation.

Cons: - I probably won't be promoted any time soon because it's hard to gain visibility and because of budgeting stuff
- One of my big projects were canceled a few months ago, which makes me question LT decisions/directions
- I choose to work remotely and don't have deep connections with my coworkers, but that might be my own doing since I don't have an interest in them
Advice: None
Pros: - Manager is great and helps me network and find interesting projects
- Work life balance is good

Cons: - Technical debt and ageing infrastructure results in a laborious code build &amp; test cycle
- On-call can be brutal on low-level cloud teams and heavily damage work-life balance
- Lack of automation results in lots of "manual labor"
- Generally, a little boring.
- Compensation generally lags behind other big tech companies.
Advice: None
Pros: - Immediate managers are compassionate and care about your career growth and workload
- Work-life balance is better than most places (except for on-call)
- Great benefits
- Huge focus on accessibility and diversity internally and externally -

Cons: Low salaries Contracts No insurance No stock Downsizing and moving everything to hubs outside the US or country of operation Outsourcing most of the admin in India No business travel No corporate responsibility programs, no social or team-building Contract max lengths 18 months depending on the country - therefore, all people are new. Low compensation and no team presence which is obvious.
Advice: Hire full-time employees and take care of their well-being
Pros: Name of the Company; Good to have on your CV Latest software

Cons: Your team culture + org can make or break your experience, yet the new grad recruiting process does not take your interests into account when placing you into a team. You also have to accept or decline your offer months before you're placed onto a team.
Advice: None
Pros: – Good benefits
– Ability to switch teams
–&nbsp;(Depending on your team) good growth opportunities + high level of autonomy

Cons: really depends on a team, all the pros are true for me but not for some of my peers from different teams
salary is less compared to other big tech companies in the area
Advice: None
Pros: stable and not too hectic, a lot of growth and opportunities of internal mobility if interested

Cons: The organisation experienced tremedous transition in product offering in last few years and this comes necessary pains of evolution. But nothing particularly of concern
Advice: Don't forget your brand and what you are known for. Remain best in what you do. 
Pros: Unbelievably qualified and knowledgeable people. Innovative and technically brilliant. Second to none.

Cons: The only downside in my time at Microsoft was the disconnect between upper management on how long it takes to truly get things completed. There is a push that things need to be done within 2 days while most projects take much longer.
Advice: None
Pros: I was blessed to be on a good corporate team at Microsoft that genuinely wanted each person to succeed. Coworkers truly tried to help you out where ever they could

Cons: big company, underrepresented minorities, no increase of salary this year
Advice: To increase diversity among underrepresented minorities in leadership roles, start by fostering a culture of inclusivity. Lead by example and actively advocate for diversity at all levels of the organization. Encourage open dialogue and actively seek out underrepresented talent in hiring processes. Implement mentorship programs and offer professional development opportunities to help individuals from underrepresented backgrounds advance in their careers. Additionally, set clear diversity goals and regularly track progress. Make diversity and inclusion a part of the company's core values and ensure that all employees, especially leaders, receive diversity training. Remember, a diverse leadership team not only promotes fairness but also brings varied perspectives that can lead to better decision-making and innovation.
Pros: flexibility, Growth mindset work life balance teamwork

Cons: You work a rotation of 3 days one week, four the next. If you’re on the back end shift it NEVER rotates, so you always work Fri-Sat. The DC I&amp;A tech is the most physical job on campus and the least paid even starting entry level. Treated as such as well.
Advice: Rotate your shifts at least every 6 months. Pay should be at least the same starting as a Site Serivce tech since DIATs have to fix their problems and do all but their installs.
Pros: You work a rotation of 3 days one week, four the next. Benefits are good. Co workers.

Cons: Some of the cons of the sales environment are internal and conflicting sales competition, sales tools, processes and policies.
Advice: None
Pros: As with any company, your experience is largely affected by the people you work most closely with. I work with amazing people and we deal with internal and external challenges as a team. I also work for an amazing leader who treats his team like professionals. Compared to my previous industry, defense contracting system integrators, the compensation is significantly better. I'm not sure how it compares to other tech companies, but I know the culture here is significantly better. Beyond my immediate sphere of people I work with, Satya Nadella is an amazing human being and CEO. He promotes hard work, he is transparent, he handles communicating bad news well and promotes and lives by an inclusive culture.

Cons: - Org changes coming that fast that Org is not able to properly land them - Managed pushing pressure 1-1 trough - Management quite disconnected from Customers and their challenges - Management managing Reports and Excel Sheets not their Teams
Advice: Start getting in front of Clients to understand the real pain points and start looking after people in your Teams and start leveraging them according to their strength and coach them on their weaknesses. And sometimes also let people go if they are not qualified for the job they have been hired for even if it won´t contribute against specific Company quotas...
Pros: - Leading Cloud and Service offering - Lot of innovation - Global Customers

Cons: Its a really big company.
Advice: None
Pros: So many companies talk a lot about work life balance, but Microsoft backs it up with resources and action. I now see why all of the Microsoft employees i worked with, prior to me joining, seemed so happy at their jobs.

Cons: - the strategy for Microsoft Advertising is weak (for example, MSAN is a joke and it continued to be pushed onto AMs to pitch) - the segment is small enough that there seems to be cliques within management/leadership - not the best promotion and retention of poc employees - be ready to deal with a lot of passive aggressiveness - the segment is a dinosaur when it comes to implementing client feedback and requests
Advice: Stop being dinosaurs with fragile egos.
Pros: - ability to work on several known brands - remote friendly - gain experience working in a fast paced environment - ability to shape your career by specializing in specific products/features - gain experience managing million dollar portfolios - enjoy good benefits that Microsoft offers such as Perk+ (health &amp; wellness stipend)

Cons: There is no room for “standing still.” If you aren’t learning, growing, or solving world hunger you’ll get left behind. The firehose of information never lets’ up. Exec officers are beholden to shareholders and Wallstreet so don’t be fooled by their nice attitude and “empowering” lingo. You are a liability, not an asset.
Advice: It’s ok to have employees doing the same role for many years. It’s how you get great at something, you practice over and over.
Pros: You are not the smartest person in the room. Working at MS afforded me the ability to solve any problem as there was always someone to ask for help or guidance. Everyone is also very willing to help as success is tied to each other.

Cons: I haven't really had any issues with Microsoft so far
Advice: None
Pros: My team is fairly open to new ideas, I have a lot of autonomy in my work. I can choose to wither work remotely or from the office, and there's a lot of opportunities for growth

Cons: Hierarchical decision-making at times
Work-life balance challenges occasionally
Fast-paced environment can be stressful
Frequent organizational restructuring can occur
Limited flexibility in certain roles
Advice: Enhance communication on changes
Prioritize work-life balance initiatives
Streamline decision-making processes
Encourage more remote work flexibility
Invest in ongoing employee training
Pros: Cutting-edge technology opportunities
Supportive and diverse workplace culture
Ample career development resources
Competitive compensation and benefits
Global collaboration and networking

Cons: It depends on the team. Sometimes lack of systematic training program and process management for some roles.
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture which avoids unconscious bias and judgements. It makes the recruitment process quite reasonable and smooth. Work-life balance is possible here and really love the leadership skills that may not be valued in many others.

Cons: You need to have a good relationship with your manager to be happy On-call work is plodding and unrelenting Job year-over-year can feel repetitive if there are no new projects Yearly team review is a joke, culture and values only matter as much as your team leads want them to
Advice: Sometimes team performance in the short term is prioritized over employee satisfaction which can lead to high turnover in the future
Pros: Flexible schedule, you can work when you want to work New projects can test your large-scale design skills and help you develop a variety of skills and responsibilities Role for every type of personality on most teams - you aren't forced to be outward-facing if you don't want to be and vice versa

Cons: Unfortunately, I was assigned to work with a young and inexperienced manager who is nick picking, micro management. And making things up for the sake of proving her point. And you can't do anything about it.
Advice: None
Pros: Challenging work environment. You will be tested and challenged constantly. You will be held to the high standard. Great career advancement opportunities. Good benefits

Cons: There is not a lot of opportunities to know people outside of work. Also it can be chaotic at times if you’re in Azure
Advice: None
Pros: Pay is great. A lot of people complain about it’s being peanut compared to competitors but it’s a lot better than what i had before, especially they still offer remote position

Cons: very slow paced, short engagements, long upskilling period in between engagements, not aware of the full scope of the project or full requirements.
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance, always on latest technology stack, working with multiple customers, multiple projects

Cons: Management depends on who your manager is. If you get a good manager, he or she will help you succeed. If you don't get a good manager, you will never learn anything but always carry too much, and you will get totally lost in your position.
Advice: There is no advice for management because it depends on who your manager is. A good manager can bring the company good people, good results, good business, etc.
Pros: Work for Microsoft, you are always learning something new. We have the best people in this world who are intelligent. If you are so, this is the best work environment for you.

Cons: - Sometimes can be difficult to work across multiple organizations due to differences in priorities
Advice: None
Pros: - WLB is great. Global company, but time is respected
- DTO, but still taking 2 weeks paid vacation per quarter
- Lots of room for growth in large scale applications and in a large organization

Cons: Layoffs.. People chosen to layoff were not last hired or weakest links.
they were arbitrary. They chose at random.
They lost 3 top performers of the 5 from my department that were laid off.
Advice: None
Pros: Wonderful managers. Great working environment. Superior benefits.
Loved my job and coworkers.

Cons: Rolling layoffs: Microsoft has been laying off people pretty much once a quarter for the past several quarters. People who have been axed are confused and people who were spared are scared that they're next on the chopping block. Lack of pay increase: Executives and managers are getting bonuses , but the employees that carry the company are left without as the company complains of a waning economy. Satya made $55mil in 2022 alone, but this company cannot spare a small cost of living raise to their employees. 2-faced CEO: Satya continues to send out insulting "encouraging" and "ra-ra" emails to the company thanking them for their hard work and that the company would not be what it is without them...all the while as they declined to offer any monetary compensation for said hard work.
Advice: COMPENSATE YOUR EMPLOYEES
Pros: There used to be a large variety of free sodas

Cons: Hours can be demanding. 24 hour on call for 1 week at a time.
Advice: Get staffing for 12hr on call shifts for engineers. All other disciplines have shifts
Pros: Results oriented culture where collaboration is encouraged

Cons: They just keep taking things away. It started with the switch to "unlimited" PTO; then announcing 10,000 layoffs; then removing perks; then the most devastating blow (so far): no annual raises at all for full-time employees. Meanwhile, we're expected to still complete work at an increased rate, with less people (because layoffs) and for less money.
Advice: I understand that management's hands are tired here. It's really up to Satya and the SLT to make a change here. Management has been given the impossible task of motivating employees with zero morale budget and zero incentives. Seems like everyone (except SLT) has been put in a lose-lose position here.
Pros: Prior to 2023, the culture here was excellent. Very team-oriented, growth mindset, heavy emphasis on work-life balance and personal growth. Microsoft seemed to truly care about its employees. Plenty of perks as well, including gifts and generous bonuses and annual raises.

Cons: As mentioned above, it's a big, enterprise-focused company. The products tend not to be sexy and major decisions take time to make.
Advice: None
Pros: For better and worse, Microsoft is a big enterprise software company. While there's a handful of people working in consumer products (mostly in Xbox), for the most part the company is about enterprise software. And it is definitely a big company, and will often feel like one -- product teams are large, decision-making can sometimes be slow, and there are a lot of different angles to consider. But at the end of the day the company places people over process. There's very few processes that are actually mandated across the whole company, and few times the process can't be adjusted to fit local circumstances. Being a big company has other advantages -- it's a company your family has heard of with products they and hundreds of millions of others use. And because the company is so large, you can change jobs within the company and do some very different things. Microsoft's not grown as fast recently as some other companies like Facebook, which means somewhat older employees and more experienced managers. Medical coverage is very good.

Cons: When it's bad, it's really bad. Open, trusting culture exists, but only during times of growth.
Advice: None
Pros: When it's great, it's really great! Super smart people, important work, good work life balance.

Cons: as a man in my late 40's I was constantly held back for promos. My sense is that this is still the case. I applaud the focus on diversity but worry about its impact on young men starting their careers there.
Advice: be more predicable with layoffs
Pros: great CEO, best benefits i ever had

Cons: My opinion of most businesses in the world and most industries, they force to much work on too few people. I'd love a raise, don't get me wrong. But I'd rather have more people on my team to spread the work around more.
Advice: Hire more people
Pros: I personally think the benefits are good for me and my family. But others, a few, do not like them. I think it is personal on works best for you and your family and if you have family on these benefits.

Cons: Big company, many layers, things move pretty slow. Hard to navigate at times and know what team or individual can help unblock something. Communication between organizations is not great in my experience. Inefficient processes seem to be hard to change.
Advice: Don't just talk the talk, but walk the walk. It's not enough to say you're listening but then nothing happens and no change is implemented.
Pros: They try really hard to take care of their people and they're very flexible when it comes to work and personal life. The compensated package is really good and the office locations in Reston are very nice. You will work with a lot of smart people that don't have big egos for the most part.

Cons: Complex organizational structure might sometimes slow down decision-making processes. In certain teams, the workload can become overwhelming, necessitating effective time management and prioritization skills. Occasionally, communication gaps between different departments can lead to inefficiencies
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft fosters a culture of innovation, offering numerous opportunities for career growth and skill development. The work environment encourages collaboration, and the company's global impact is truly inspiring. The comprehensive benefits package and flexible work hours are definite advantages.

Cons: Due to the large impact and customer base, you would not expect the same pace as a startup company.
Advice: None
Pros: Inspiring company mission ; building products with great impact

Cons: Reduction in Force (Layoffs) were not performance based but random. High performers let go - very short sighted decisions made by finance with no input from Team Leadership.
Advice: None
Pros: Value/Deal at Microsoft, ample time off, great benefits, working with a supportive management team.

Cons: - The only training I've had in the last 4 years was diversity and inclusion training. - The latest - culture conversations - literally taught "there is no such thing as individual accomplishment". I didn't understand how this could be consistent with the stack ranking process but with the latest announcement it now makes sense. With this year's 0 merit and "historic" bonus levels (i.e. low) announcement its already been communicated that no one will receive rewards above the average target rewards that everyone will receive regardless of their level of impact. Thanks! Now I have no reason to even try to work or be concerned about impact.
Advice: - if there's no budget to replace my 5 year old desktop and we have to RIF 10,000 FTEs and kill entire teams and products, why is there budget to pay everyone left in the company a half day salary to attend culture conversations and diversity training? - why is it that non-D&amp;I protected candidates can't even move internally without the hiring manager being required to justify why 2 or more D&amp;I protected candidates shouldn't be hired first?
Pros: - Compensation &amp; Benefits - If D&amp;I is your religion, you'll have overwhelming opportunities to praise and worship

Cons: As someone who was laid off, I think the strategic sales teams are far more at risk for reductions than other teams. I also think Microsoft is at times too large. I would recommend joining anything in communications, engineering, product management, or any other field where you are building something tangible. Also, be careful of "Program Management" roles that are vague in their description.
Advice: Support employees by pointing them to tangible areas in the organization that create value. This could be special projects, hackathons, etc.
Pros: There were amazing things happening within Microsoft. Generative AI tech, awesome products, smart/sharp teams.

Cons: - Enormous changes post COVID; a lot of churn; I came in with a original group of a dozen employees. A year later maybe three or four still remained. Losing co-workers that you've developed relations is difficult. - Compensation somewhat behind other tech companies, startups, partners, etc. - Expectations of work can be brutal, sometimes you will hit 60/h weeks during releases. - Frequent management changes. It can be difficult to get promoted when you have a different manager every year.
Advice: - Increase compensation and when communicating with employees - "Less is more."
Pros: - One the best tech companies in the world - Amazing supportive people that are interested in things beyond money but making the world a better place with technology

Cons: You will be extremely busy with learning new products, keeping up with administrative tasks and balancing a lot of meetings. However, you learn quickly on what to prioritize and where to invest most of your time (meeting with customers is the most important).
Advice: Reduce sales tool complexity and make sure that sales reports and metrics are aligned so that what sales is paid on matches what management prioritizes.
Pros: While daily life can be hectic, the company prioritizes time off and personal well being so you can take time off as needed to refresh and recharge. Sales leadership is very supportive if you reach out and clearly articulate what you need. As with any large company, you have to be good at navigating the complexities of each org, but it's worth investing the time in learning where to go to find answers. If you stay the course, max out your 401(k), employee stock purchase plan, and stay invested for the long term, you will have a nice nest egg to retire on. This is one of the best companies to stay with for the long term. Job hoppers will not do well here, but it is a great place to explore different career options within the company.

Cons: I love Microsoft, but teams and environments can be toxic and unbearable.
Advice: Advise managers not to give up on their employees or take sides,
Pros: You are not safe anywhere; so don't play safe. Dare to play hard and not be afraid of failure.

Cons: Bureaucracy Back to back meetings Constant reporting culture Growth Mindset is a talk, if you make a mistake, you’re pilloried Performance based review system and bonus (called Connects, now rated against a line b. bell curve but still works the same with expectations of percentage of employees at all stages)
Advice: You built a precarious inclusive culture on the backs of employees who demonstrated vulnerability in sharing their stories and then you riffed them and stopped investing in D&amp;I budgets. Don’t say you care when you’re not prepared to put your money where mouth is. Don’t say you’re a Learn it all culture when you divest in L&amp;D resources Your expectations of managers during COVID was high but your support for managers was poor, upper executives didn’t match support for the managers that took incremental emotional load.
Pros: Smart people New AI innovation Overall compensation package Hybrid work

Cons: Microsoft isn’t for those who are comfortable being in one specific position for three or more years. They will reinforce the need to self-develop and learn new skills. It's not uncommon for lower-level positions to be changed around or reclassified, so employees need to keep moving forward into greater Microsoft.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft benefits are amazing They vigorously promote from within (can be a con for some) Awesome work-life balance

Cons: The work can be fast-paced and changes seem to come out of nowhere with little warning from leadership. But that is often true in any large organization.
Advice: Nothing. Leadership in my org has been nothing but amazing.
Pros: Amazing Pay, Benefits, and People.

Cons: Bad management Creating a fear culture HR is a waste of time Culture has changed drastically in 2 years Get a bad manager and you’re life will be awful.
Advice: There is an initiative for management push people out rather than give severance and have layoffs. Managers are pushing wrongful termination instead of having layoffs.
Pros: Product mix Solid investments Seems to cater to employees

Cons: * Lots of cases to work * Lot's of mandatory training modules * Multiple logins and JIT elevations * Constant changes with tool sets
Advice: None
Pros: * Availability of other team members across other platforms. * Growth mindset * Great co-workers * Flexible works schedule * Opportunity to grow * Work with the smartest people in the would * Inclusive environment

Cons: they are the brains behind modern Ai warfare
Advice: don't do that.
Pros: Good pay, never been micromanaged

Cons: Impossible to move within company. Layoffs all the time. Impossible to predict if your job is safe.
Advice: Stop with the random layoffs.
Pros: Great job. Great hours. Can't beat vacation. Good benefits.

Cons: Most of the upper management has come in from Intel and doesn't fit well with the Microsoft culture &amp; values.
Advice: None
Pros: The company is focused on innovating around AI. Particularly for Azure Hardware, there is good momentum to work on custom silicon chips for training and inference of AI workloads (Azure MAIA) as well as for general purpose compute (Azure Cobalt)

Cons: Stressful and divisive work culture, old school management practices, Political performance reviews. Opaque process for determining performance bonus. Adversarial HR practices.
Advice: No, they don't listen to advice!🤣
Pros: 75th percentile pay range. Good medical benefits. Commuter shuttles. Lots of community activities.

Cons: Recent downsizing of office space, leading to a sometimes claustrophobic environment.
Advice: None
Pros: - Opportunity to work with talented colleagues.
- Reliable management.
- Exposure to cutting-edge technologies.

Cons: Management chain is a drag on completing work Org structure has too many managers who do not know what they're doing HR, C-Suite, and upper management could care less when your manager sucks Is more interested in keeping the "good ol' boys club" rather than acknowledging failure or accepting that alternative solutions are more effective Your new ideas are a threat to the company and their management chain Management doesn't know nearly as much as you, so they try to put you down and gaslight you HR could care less that you saw bad things, motto, "See something, report it", but reality is, "reporting something means you're the next to get fired" Mission statements are there only to lure you in, make you think they do good. They don't follow the mission themselves. Complete con-job
Advice: Review your own self worth cause you're degrading the company value, capability, and progress. If you cannot build it, don't act like you know how and stay out way of those who are actual professionals at computing. If you have mission statements, FOLLOW THEM! I cannot express enough how pathetic your execution of the mission statements was. Yet you pitch them in meetings like you follow them. All lies.
Pros: Challenging work Large variety of type of work to do Variety of people from all different walks of life

Cons: Seen as an intern role with experience when role states apprentice could someone without any background and to build them up. Was the biggest barrier, do your best and network with everyone. Maybe consider going into office with the team that is hybrid.
Advice: None
Pros: Remote, all equipment setup, paid weekly, hands on coding experience, learned Typescript and software development experience was valuable to see the day to day life of an engineer and project life cycle.

Cons: Massive company means everyone's jobs are smaller with more overlap. You will spend more time doing "alignment" with other internal people on a lot of days than you will do the actual work.
Advice: None
Pros: Extreme scale - opportunity to work on things that are global and huge. Tons of smart people in every field. Strong brand, good ethics. A company you can be proud of.

Cons: Stuff moves really slowly, culture depends on your team and in my experience there isn't much you can do to influence your team culture. The employee demographic overall is on the older side, which isn't a con in itself but if you're young/fresh out of college don't expect to meet a lot of peers who you'll want to socialize with after work. Also in my team the onboarding for new grad hires is nonexistent and I see the new grads being stuck with busy work while interesting/high impact work is reserved for people who have been at the company for 10+ years.
Advice: None
Pros: WLB, benefits, all that is great. Work is generally very laid back. Moving teams within the company is doable because it's unlikely you'll be ignored by the hiring manager since you are already an employee, however you still need to go through the whole interview process.

Cons: Pay is less compared to FAANG companies, I've seen people quite Microsoft due to bad managers (so happiness may vary based on teams), work-life balance can be bad during some crunches, live site support will be mandatory if you work on the web.
Advice: Make the hiring process better, improve pay for people, if you cut people and freeze hiring, expect every aspect of the product to deteriorate and build up engineering debt that you'll never be able to pay back and forever take hits on productivity and dev velocity. More investments in engineering culture.
Pros: Flexibility, work-life-balance, some of the benefits are nice (stayfit reimbursements, donation matching, 401k 100% match, unlimited time off, etc.), lots of internal technical resources so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

Cons: Products are difficult to use (and sell). Marketing will be unimaginative, not a lot of room for creativity. An overinflated sense of urgency and self importance drives a tendency to overcomplicate work. You'll likely be in meetings all day. Biggest con of all: The company talks a lot about diversity and inclusion but one manager who doesn't understand you will smear your reputation and end your career. And even if you had 11 great years there prior to being re-orged to him, everyone will stand behind him.
Advice: Listen to employees when they raise flags about managers who are creating circumstances that prevent success. And make sure your white male managers learn to receive and value feedback.
Pros: Good pay and benefits package. Smart colleagues. Fun problems to solve. Well fleshed out teams.

Cons: Experience depends on the team. I had a bad experience (3 different managers in 18 months-- two of whom left on one days notice). Others had better experiences on other teams.
Advice: None
Pros: Smart, driven people; large budgets; great benefits and matching giving program

Cons: None, its a great company to work for

Advice: None
Pros: The overall company culture is great! Great benefits, perks, people.

Cons: Very large organization with mid level managers trying to keep their jobs makes it a bit of a rat race at times.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and work flexibility. Enormous amount of educational content to upskill yourself.

Cons: Lived experience of the culture is still varied across a spectrum, depending on where in the company you work. Largely determined by your direct manager and/or the leadership above them. Pressure to deliver and individual results often still trump contributing to the success of others and leveraging the work of others (how) vs. just the "what" of delivery no matter what damage was done to achieve it.
Advice: Honestly evaluate your own MINDSET and how that matches with the aspire-to culture. Make adjustments where needed. Then MODEL the behaviors of the culture , really. That will accelerate the culture change, morale, productivity, learning, and ultimately innovation across the company.
Pros: Incredible benefits, opportunity to impact and change the world (literally), work with and learn from some of the smartest people on the planet.

Cons: Big corporation, hard to navigate if you are new to the organization.

Cons: It is a lot of work.
Advice: Please, find a way to account for work-life balance of the employees.
Pros: The team is willing to teach and guide young professionals

Cons: - Some issues with D&amp;I, some teams are very inclusive and understanding while others are not, can also depend on individual managers or teammates - It can take a very long time for projects to come to life, about 8m-1y average - Can be a lot if you are not used to working on very large teams - Can be very unorganized, depending on the team you are working on

Cons: The expectations are high, and staying current with tech training while still producing business impact can be a big challenge.
Advice: Move some of the money that goes into fancy buildings to improve the home offices of remote workers a little more
Pros: Generally Microsoft managers walk the talk: I was largely afforded my own autonomy and expected to lead, but I was also given massive resources and connections for assistance or guidance. It's hard to imagine a better place to work.

Cons: internal documentation usually sucks lol
Advice: hire real PMs to write docs and track work

Cons: Pace may not be to everyone's liking - experiences can vary depending on division, team, and manager.
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits, good tech, good culture

Cons: Since the CEO took a raise last yr then laid off about 20,000 people the fear mongering is at an all time high, every day you stress if you'll be next. The ranking system Balmer had was removed but brought back this year as a scale. It's a dumpster fire. Lie and kiss your superior feet but make sure you are toxic then you are promoted. Do your job you are passed over. They claim DEI but they don't live it at all. just more lies and puppets of senior leadership team. No loyalty to anyone but walstreet.
Advice: None

Cons: Lack of proper support line for customers

Advice: None
Pros: No other tech company has the level of benefits that Microsoft offers.

Cons: *Treated like a seller but not paid like a seller *Limited growth potential with good ideas *SLT bares teeth now rather than good vibes
Advice: Incentivize on target work both on the front and back of the FY. Pay people what they are worth and leave the stick/carrot up to the IC to determine whether personal time off is more important to them in the current FY or ADDITIONAL, aka rewarded for going ABOVE expectations, pay is more important to them. Rewards should not be lumped into my base value of worth for doing the job, yet they are.

Stock growth
HQ Leadership

Cons: not as fast paced as other companies
Advice: None
Pros: good work life balance and culture

Cons: As a new hire I've never felt more lost than I have at Microsoft. I've worked at 2 other companies, one of them being a fortune 500 company with a big tech sector and while I have the most experience starting this job it is by far the hardest to excel in. It's hard to get others to help because everyone's remote, and the environments we work in is so convoluted and hard to understand. I've been here a year and still feel like I started yesterday. Also, there is a new initiative to increase velocity, but they also announced no raises this year. So basically, doing more work for less money. The worst is how much it affected my mental health. I've started seeing a psychiatrist because this job has been so draining and has caused depression. Just today I was hoping to focus on one area of frontend work, but then I got recruited to do some backend things which I'm not familiar in and investigate some logs.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay and benefits and if you like working from home they fully support the work at home model.

Cons: very hard to advance, need to get hired high level otherwise very hard to advance
Advice: None
Pros: Good people, interesting work, wfh is really good

Cons: Pay, doing several jobs but not being fairly paid, not recognized for hard work. Leadership at the top has no clue of what we are doing and how to help make things better. There is no real path for promotion- it's harder to obtain a new role then leaving and reapplying. They base your position on a level and some jobs have such a high level that you can't even apply to them. This is wrong- if you leave and come back, leveling is not an issue. So, being a valued employee for several years holds no weight.
Advice: Levels should not be accounted for when employees are trying to move up and get promoted. Your experience and performance are what should matter. Finding more ways to make retail employees more marketable and a chance to get to corporate positions should be more supported.
Pros: Benefits are great! You get a stay fit perk that can be used years for 500.00

Cons: There are no cons at all.
Advice: None
Pros: Good salary and office, free food too.

Cons: Sometimes can be confusing about what should be done.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance and managers are usually reasonable.

Cons: Too much power to managers and they abuse the power.
Do not expect HR to help.
Advice: Some teams’ diversity is 100% majority to 0% minority. Culture needs to be improved still, reduce bureaucracy.
Pros: Some products are good to work on.
Benefits covers many areas.

Cons: None. As far as corporate goes, it’s top tier.
Advice: None
Pros: Great Benefits. Competitive pay. Supportive team.

Very strict pipeline management

Cons: Internal Bureaucracy is challenging to get things done.
Advice: None
Pros: Sales Resources for Sales team

Cons: Can have a bad team or a good one
Advice: None
Pros: Many nice intern events and activites

Cons: - The promotion system is horrible and does not reward talent and "impact". Your promotions are dependent on not just your manager but also your skip level manager. Even after working on multiple high visibility projects, demonstrating strong technical and leadership skills, as a woman you will have to prove all those items twice as hard as men at this company. That goes for minorities as well.
Advice: Rework the promotion system so it is less polically driven, and more objectively driven. As a tech company, you should be rewarding technical expertise and impact objectively and less subjectively. Women and minorities are still facing a glass ceiling for promotions from level 1 and 2 to senior and up. If you are truly about diversity and inclusion, then take a harder look at your promotion system.
Pros: - Ok pay - Good benefits - Interesting projects

Cons: Still a massive company with massive company issues. Hard to get promoted. People stay in the same role for a long time.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft is the real deal. There's a reason no one leaves. Great pay, great benefits, great work environment, great product(s). You get the A team at Microsoft.

Cons: Limited growth opportunities are there.
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is good

Cons: Working as a Web Developer at Microsoft has been an enlightening journey, but like any experience, there are a few drawbacks to consider. While the positives are abundant, here are some cons that I've encountered during my time at the company: Bureaucracy and Size: Microsoft's vast size can sometimes lead to bureaucratic processes. Decision-making can be slower due to multiple layers of approval, which can be frustrating when you're eager to implement innovative solutions quickly. Fast-Paced Environment: While the fast-paced nature of the tech industry is exciting, it can also be demanding. Tight deadlines and ambitious project goals can sometimes lead to high-pressure situations, affecting work-life balance. Complexity of Projects: Given the company's focus on cutting-edge technology, projects can sometimes become quite complex. While this presents an excellent opportunity for growth, it can also be challenging and overwhelming, especially for junior developers.
Advice: None
Pros: 've had the incredible opportunity to work as a Web Developer at Microsoft, and let me tell you, it's been a journey filled with growth, innovation, and unparalleled experiences. Here's why I absolutely love being a part of the Microsoft web development team: Cutting-edge Technology: Microsoft is at the forefront of technological advancement, and as a web developer here, I've had the privilege of working with the latest tools, frameworks, and technologies. This constant exposure to cutting-edge innovations has not only enhanced my skillset but also kept me excited and motivated every day. Collaborative Environment: The work culture at Microsoft promotes collaboration and teamwork like no other. I've had the chance to collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry, and the brainstorming sessions, code reviews, and pair programming exercises have significantly improved the quality of my work. Continuous Learning: Microsoft places a strong emphasis on learning and growth. The company offers various learning resources, workshops, and conferences that have helped me stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving web development landscape. The continuous learning mindset here is truly inspiring. Impactful Projects: One of the most satisfying aspects of working as a web developer at Microsoft is the chance to work on projects that have a global impact. The products and services we create touch the lives of millions, and knowing that my code contributes to such impactful solutions gives me a sense of purpose. Diverse Perspectives: Microsoft is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment. This diversity of thought and perspective has enriched my problem-solving abilities and has opened my eyes to new ways of approaching challenges.

However, the downside is that the extensive travel demands can make it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Pros: I've had the pleasure of working at this company, and I must say that the benefits package they offer is truly exceptional. From healthcare and retirement plans to generous paid time off, it's evident that they prioritize their employees' well-being and satisfaction.

Pros: work life balance with happiness

Cons: Performance reviews plan to manage a percentage of the workforce every year Hard to stay employed there after the age of 60 you can't be happy in a position and not wish to advance. Quit allowing people to evaluate their peers that they compete with in performance reviews reward teams over individuals Everyone deserves a sabbatical
Advice: The perception that no US employees retire from Microsoft seems pretty accurate to me. Quit laying off people over the age of 60. Quit allowing managers to not give bonuses to someone that has been there 20+ years and has never not had a bonus before. Don't expect everyone is wanting to move upward in their career.

Pros: Honestly the best corporate leadership culture out of any company I've ever worked for. Management says they care and it's evident in the way they treat people. Their actions actually match their stated values. Which is pretty amazing. Benefits are good pay is good it's really hard to beat. But the healthy non toxic culture would make me stay even if i was offered significantly more money. It's that important. Also remote work. No amount of money would ever convince me to go back to an office and so far they 100% embrace remote for some positions so I'll likely be here for a very long time.

Cons: not too much cons old fashioned software engineering company
Advice: None
Pros: nice environment great culture nice facilities

Cons: -CFO office runs our strategy and R&amp;D now, not technical leadership (IBM spiral) -Middle management ("frozen middle") runs the place, and has suffocated any and all creativity and drive to take pride in quality of work out of the ICs. -Promotion decisions in last 2-3 years have been even less rational than crony days of yore; people completely unqualified for the role and responsibilities they are being given slotted in for political agendas and being given far more chances to fail than anyone before them; ICs paying the price. -Last of the long termers advantages to staying were eliminated with the guaranteed holidays. Now, you can be here 1 day or 20 years, and you are the same. New system will be abused heavily by "frozen middle"
Advice: None. They don't read or care about the opinions of us peasants.
Pros: Used to have better WLB, increasingly not so much. Medical and Stayfit are better than many places. Otherwise, only Pro remaining is you have a job, and usually pays better than 80% of other places, but not if you are a talented veteran. If that, you need to leave asap.

Advice: None
Pros: Chill culture, smart colleagues, interesting work with lots to learn

Cons: micromanagement and not enough self autonomy
Advice: none
Pros: pay is pretty good with bonus

Cons: Intense competition: The tech industry is highly competitive, and Microsoft is no exception. Employees may feel pressure to constantly perform at a high level to keep up. Large and bureaucratic: As a large corporation, Microsoft can sometimes feel bureaucratic, with layers of management and decision-making processes. Work-life balance: Some employees may find it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance due to the fast-paced nature of the tech industry.
Advice: None
Pros: Great compensation: Microsoft offers competitive salaries and benefits packages to its employees. Opportunities for growth and development: Microsoft encourages its employees to pursue their professional goals and provides various learning and development programs. Innovative culture: Microsoft is known for its innovative and forward-thinking culture, which fosters creativity and encourages employees to think outside the box. Impactful work: Many employees at Microsoft feel that their work has a significant impact on society and the world at large. Diverse and inclusive workplace: Microsoft prioritizes diversity and inclusion, providing a safe and welcoming environment for employees of all backgrounds.

Cons: Bureaucratic processes, lots of KPIs
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, good Work life balance

Cons: It's a very large company, so your mileage may vary. Every manager is different and your work may not have the impact you want. This is reconciled by the opportunity to move internally.
Advice: Keep up the regular town halls with the leadership team, and answer the harder questions when they come up.
Pros: Many people at Microsoft have been there for a long time. I anticipate doing the same because they value growth and learning. Mistakes are opportunities to learn, and everyone advocates to getting help sooner rather than later.

Cons: Some internal processes can be heavy and slow down your work.
Advice: Stay connected to the field and talk to your people
Pros: Great company, great technology stack with smart people with a strong collaborative mindset. A great place to grow!

Cons: - Pay is lower compared to other companies. - Too many inept middle managers throughout the company. - Senior management is completely out of touch. - Turn around time to accomplish anything is slow. Don't expect anything to be completed on time. - Many teams like to play the blame game and refuse to take responsibility for work assigned to them.
Advice: - Reduce the number of unnecessary middle managers. - Give engineers the resources they need to complete their projects on time. - Stop allowing certain teams to shift blame and work onto others. - Try harder to actually include people when if you're serious about diversity and inclusion. Right now, it's mostly a fad term that doesn't mean much outside of public presentations.
Pros: - Good benefits - Good work/life balance

Cons: Large organization, Changing Landscape and Cube lifestyle.
Advice: None
Pros: The Culture, Campus and Colleagues.

Cons: too focused on results instead of wellbeing within my team
Advice: None
Pros: overall company culture is great but not within my org

Cons: "Culture." This is a hot-button word leadership and sr. leadership like to tote around, but the reality is the shareholders heavily influence the culture and future of the org. The 10,000+ layoffs this year (2023) no or very limited raises this year "due to economic times" came as both a shock and a disappointment, as the organization has had a record-breaking year (again) and is looking to spend $69,000,000,000 in CASH for Activision/Blizzard. It does not seem to add up. "Diversity + Inclusion" is another hot-button word Microsoft likes to use, but the company only cares about diversity of color, not diversity of thought. DEI here just checks a box and feels more like pandering than actually doing anything of substance. Benefits - while the benefits are excellent here, they vary greatly per role. The company likes to talk about being "one Microsoft." Still, there is a huge disparity of benefits and rewards between retail/hourly workers and corporate Microsoft, also referred to as "greater" Microsoft. Corporate employees get higher stock/bonuses/rewards, have 3x the amount allotted for fitness reimbursement, and have higher tuition reimbursement than hourly workers (data centers, stores, digital sales reps, etc.). I understand there may be different rewards for perceived differences in value/ROI, but don't pretend to be "one Microsoft" if all is not equal. Paid time off - Microsoft used to have accrued time off based on length of service. This meant you earned your time off. However, the org recently moved to "unlimited discretionary time off (DTO)." On paper, this is great; at the discretion of your manager, there is no longer a cap on the amount of time you can take off. It also looks great on paper to say "unlimited time off." The issue is that it is discretionary. Instead of telling your manager when you would like to take time off based on your earned PTO, you now have to ask permission. Your manager is now free to tell you "no" if it does not align with the needs of the business.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft offers very generous benefits. The cost of medical, dental, vision, legal, AD&amp;D, and life insurance for a family of 3 was less than $80/month. Microsoft also offers 401K match, employee stock purchase program, tuition reimbursement, adoption reimbursement, and a fitness/health reimbursement. Pending your team and your manager, work/life balance and flexibility can fluctuate. In my case, we were "required" to be in the office one day/per week, but was not enforced. Other team leaders require you to badge into an office 1-3 times/week.

Advice: None
Pros: Good engineers, wlb, pay good high stock growth

Cons: Large organization so moving up the ladder is more difficult

Pros: Best benefits especially for health and fitness related. Great amenities. Stability in terms of career growth

Cons: long working hours, politics, culture,
Advice: None
Pros: benefits, people, and work-life balance

Cons: I was first on a team that had no proper direction on what we would do. It was pure chaos. They would change the team's mission and reorg us multiple times. It was not like that on a different team after I made a switch. So choose carefully!

Advice: None

Cons: Corporate bureaucracy extends across roles that are reflected in the core business decisions.
Advice: Treat employees like assets rather than business expenses.
Pros: Industry leader of identifying and applying the latest technologies

Cons: On the downside, I felt that the company didn't always communicate clearly about changes in policies or procedures. There were a few times when I found out about new initiatives or changes through the grapevine instead of through official channels, which could be frustrating.
Advice: Provide opportunities for growth: Employees want to feel like they are growing and developing in their careers. Offer opportunities for training and development, and help employees set goals for their professional growth.
Pros: I worked at Azure for two years and overall, it was a positive experience. The company culture was great and everyone was friendly and supportive. The work environment was also very collaborative, which made it easy to work on projects with colleagues from different departments.

Cons: Very short-sided when it comes to customers Longterm needs. They are not a partner when it comes to working with SLG government.
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits package is great "0" cost healthcare

Cons: - Amy Hood has explicitly said they target 70% pay of the FAANG companies. They justified this by saying we have more stability and less WLB issues. Now we've laid off over 10,000 employees, we've been told by Satya to "do more with less", and we've had our bonuses eliminated despite hitting an all time stock high. Given the actions of our leadership, proceed with caution - Certain teams like Azure and Xbox have far worse work life balance than other teams. They can also be highly competitive, making a raise or promo difficult - Role expectations can be pretty rigid. Rather than management looking at your strengths, you are graded against a strict rubric. If you don't fit the mould, your career will suffer - Internal transfers are just as hard as external transfers, as you still have to do a full interview loop
Advice: - Cut the crazy politics. The teams are extremely vertical and too much time is wasted with people trying to figure out how to appease the person above them. Empower and trust the ICs to work with autonomy - Either pay like a FAANG company or expect worse performance than a FAANG company. You can't have it both ways - Handle layoffs with more tact. The rolling layoffs for 4 months that could hit at any time were incredibly disrespectful to every employee in the company. There's no reason you couldn't tell us how many of the 10,000 target had been laid off already, or pick certain days to do the layoffs so people didn't have to worry the next day. Other companies handled this with more dignity. Don't reinvent the wheel, just follow their lead.
Pros: - Relatively stable if you're on a team that turns high profits - Good Healthcare - Full remote is supported

Cons: Sometimes, the pace of change is slow.

Pros: Interesting tech and good compensation.

Cons: -Toxic management expects delivery at all costs -Maintenance and bug fixes aren’t valued, only KPIs -Career progression is almost entirely dependent on manager and what work they choose to give you. Creating impact outside of the scope of what your manager assigns you is seen as insubordination. -Low pay which is falling further behind the rest of the industry year after year -Incomprehensible quantities of technical debt created by sky high turnover and pressure from management to deliver KPIs quickly and then abandon them -chaotic on call rotations with little to no onboarding for new developers. Expect to be pages continuously for the entire duration of your rotation.
Advice: Stop bleeding engineers by increasing pay and giving engineers time to pay down the tech debt that has accumulated over the years. Microsoft’s culture of pushing a KPI out the door, claiming impact, and then abandoning it and moving to something else with no plan for ongoing maintenance is not sustainable. Stop treating engineers as disposable.
Pros: Intelligent coworkers, good brand, universal tech stack

Cons: There is a lot of process overhead
Advice: None
Pros: Get to work on technically challenging projects.

Cons: Constant re-orgs (minimum once per year), lack of leadership accountability, focus on the daily firedrill instead of focus on core strategy
Advice: None
Pros: Some of the best benefits in the industry, competitive pay, good people

Cons: Just as with any company, it is 100% dependent upon your manager, and their willingness to fight for you. If you get a bad manager, the odds of you being promoted is very low.
Advice: Managers who have been in the role for several years need to step back and look at the dynamics of the managers underneath them. Just because somebody has been there a long time does not make them a good candidate to be a people manager.

Decent work life balance

Cons: Work life balance is non existent, so pay doesn't really scale, and vacation is a dream. Burn Out is a definite promise. Culture is unprofessional, managers are not managers, they lack professional training, and with that non ethical, hostile work environment, and bias towards ethicality.
Advice: You lost your one benefit, your winning culture, it will take decades to win it back. Sad to see all of the companies revenues leaving US and going to other economies.

Pros: nice environment and cool colleagues

Cons: Moved on because I had two terrible managers. They both didn't like new ideas and didn't value the prior experience I brought to the table. Word of advice, make sure you are 100% sure the level of the role before accepting. Managers will take advantage of experienced employees and align them to lower-level roles because of the prestige of working at Microsoft. They then wonder why these experienced employees are bored.
Advice: Do better! Be open to new ideas and ensure employees are aligned with the role and its impact based on the level.

Advice: None
Pros: Loved it when I first started in the 90's.

Cons: Mission, core values and leadership principles are well defined yet not followed by many leaders. I worked for a few poor leaders focused on themselves rather than employees.

Pros: Good W/L Balance Great benefits Lots of potential to work on impactful products Good growth opportunities Company culture generally pretty inclusive/feel-good

Cons: the standard operating procedure is to hire recent college graduates and have a seasoned person train them and then turn around and "layoff" the seasoned person - keeping the recent college graduate who has no experience. On top of this practice leadership is reducing benefits, salaries and bonus while the CEO received a 10% raise this fiscal AFTER laying off 12000 employees due to the economy.
Advice: hire people who are qualified to do the job not the cheapest you can find and treat them with the same level of respect that you expect

Advice: When you acquire a company, communicate better with them. Let people know that you’re looking to make changes. Notify those who are no longer needed from the acquisition earlier on so that they have the opportunity to look for other work within Microsoft. There were several people from my team that were let go that are highly competent and skilled, and could’ve been a benefit to your company. Many were let go not due to poor performance but because of a balance sheet.
Pros: Profitable, competent, strategic, great benefits, and perks

Cons: General uncertainty re job stability
Advice: None
Pros: Great training and opportunity to move around the company

Cons: Too woke. Trying to change my worldview instead of respecting my perspective. Racism in the workplace.

Pros: Nice environment, good colleagues , learning opportunities

Cons: Nothing at all. Hard to find something wrong.

Pros: Both management coworkers do everything to help. In my 2 years of working as a full-time employee, I have grown in my professional and personal life thanks to my co-workers, including management who are also co-workers. Microsoft treats us as family, no as employees. The benefits are incredible and Microsoft always is looking for improvement.

Cons: Working in "the matrix" makes decision making slow. Lots of meetings. Lots of people that have to get on the same page. Lots of dependencies. Pace of reorgs can be draining. I've had a manager change every 9 months.
Advice: None
Pros: AI innovation has created tailwinds for the company. Work environment is fast-paced, collaborative and mainly focused on customer and business outcomes.

Cons: * As with most large companies, you’ll have limited upward visibility or mobility unless working on an important customer facing project. * Pay is lower than most big tech companies
Advice: Managers who are directly over the team should have a larger stake in understanding the work that is being done. Devs should not be writing their own stories, closing out their own stories, etc bc of a managers lack of understanding of what’s going on. Not asking for technical knowledge from managers, just the basics so valued conversations can be had.
Pros: * Stable work(for the most part) * Great benefits: 401k matching best in class along with healthcare * Job can be remote on team by team basis

Cons: The CEO has changed a lot for employee’s empathy. Since his tragic loss he’s checked out as a cultural leader. Other SLT’s are running the company into the ground, and the culture has so much become toxic.
Advice: Get empathy back for your front line employees, and start rebuilding your culture! Without a positive culture, your employees are dying.
Pros: Stock equity, health insurance, other benefits

Cons: Pay is not very competitive.
Advice: None
Pros: Rotational program for plenty of exposure and upskilling. Great Brand.

Pros: Good health and wellness and fun

Cons: I was told by Microsoft upper management that my team would not be affected by layoffs and then I was laid off 2 weeks later.
Advice: None
Pros: I loved my position at Microsoft. The managers seemed to really care about the employees. Even after I was laid off, my manager continued to contact me about how I was doing.

Cons: Stock offering is way less then industry. Slow in innovation
Advice: Lead the Innovation on Hardware side too. Lots of opportunities and potential. Eliminate Non-Value-Added processes within each department. Introduce KPI's within each department including Design and NPI.
Pros: Excellent work environment Excellent Benefits Great Product.

Cons: Hard to make progress with internal stakeholders Processes are confusing and complex Total comp less than other high profile tech companies Career progression is hard unless you have a high level sponsor
Advice: Morale is extremely low with the constant lay-offs. Hiring freeze means people are doing multiple roles and WLB suffering. Pay freeze means that Microsoft is moving even further behind the high profile tech companies
Pros: Good WLB in sales The blue badge opens doors with customers Access to all latest Microsoft tech Internal IT really good

Cons: Microsoft can sometimes be lower in compensation, but I believe they make up for it in their benefits, flexibility, and work life balance.
Advice: None
Pros: - Remote available - Flexible - Support learning and growing

Cons: Manager really makes it or breaks it. I'm not sure how all orgs are but mine defs isn't a healthy position to be in
Advice: None
Pros: Overall culture was amazing until my managers were switched

Cons: Constant reorganizations can be a headache
Advice: None
Pros: Good tech to work on in Azure with some fantastic engineers

Cons: My time as an engineer at Microsoft was nothing short of disappointing and left me with an overall negative impression of the company. While it is undoubtedly a prestigious tech giant, my personal experience has been far from the ideal work environment I had hoped for. First and foremost, the work culture at Microsoft was incredibly toxic and cutthroat. Instead of fostering a collaborative atmosphere, there was a constant sense of competition among colleagues. This environment made it difficult to form meaningful working relationships and left me feeling isolated and unsupported. The excessive focus on meeting deadlines and achieving unrealistic targets often overshadowed the quality of work and employee well-being. Additionally, I was dismayed by the lack of recognition for hard work and dedication. Despite putting in long hours and going the extra mile to deliver results, I seldom received acknowledgment or appreciation from management. This lack of recognition left me feeling undervalued as an employee and significantly impacted my motivation. Furthermore, the technology and tools provided were outdated and cumbersome to work with. While Microsoft is known for its technological advancements, it was surprising to see that the engineering teams were often forced to work with subpar resources. This not only hindered our productivity but also made it challenging to keep up with competitors in the rapidly evolving tech industry.
Advice: None
Pros: I recently had the privilege of working as an engineer at Microsoft, and I must say, it has been an extraordinary experience that exceeded all my expectations. From the very beginning, I was thoroughly impressed by the company's commitment to innovation, its supportive work culture, and the plethora of opportunities for professional growth. One of the standout aspects of my time at Microsoft was the cutting-edge technology and projects I had the chance to be a part of. The company's dedication to pushing the boundaries of innovation was evident in every project, and as an engineer, it was both inspiring and motivating to work with such visionary teams. The resources and tools provided were state-of-the-art, which allowed us to develop solutions that had a real impact on the world.

Cons: Customers have a hard time seeing the value of Dynamics 365 and if you are lucky enough to sell something it might look like 1 -3 deals per quarter ( if that) . There are better CRM and ERP platforms out there, and ERP is an even harder solution to position to customers who have no current knowledge of D365 ERP.
Advice: expectations are unrealistic for sellers
Pros: The base salary for these roles are competitive , but the role itself is extremely among other parts of the business.

Cons: No free food at all
Advice: None
Pros: Free drink and place to grow

Cons: . Recent layoffs across the company shocked many ppl. .Azure orgs have a steep learning curve because the systems are complex . Oncall and incident driven work may not be for everyone .Azure is quite complex to ramp up. Depending on your manager and the level you get hired, you may be expected to understand the systems in unreasonable time. This gets worse when Senior employees do not help well with ramp up or don't have good documentation available . Azure has lots of diferent orgs. So all I am saying here is team dependent. I dont know how it is in other orgs or teams across Microsoft. The quicker you ramp up, the easier the job becomes, the better your confidence and WLB
Advice: None
Pros: . Nice Pay . WFH first culture . Great office culture . Very Impactful work in Azure orgs and lots of career growth .WLB may be poor or good depending on how quickly you ramp up and understand the systems.

Cons: Compensation is on the lower side
Advice: None
Pros: Best work life balance you can get

Cons: I didn't learn anything from my first team. The team wanted more of a Project Manager and didn't utilize any of my skills. When I switched teams, there was a huge difference. The work culture was great and they expected me to own a Product and make my own decisions. I think you use your interviews wisely to gauge the position.
Advice: None
Pros: Smart coworkers Good perks Hybrid / remote work for most positions

Cons: Hard work but very rewarding
Advice: Interact with employees as much as possible
Pros: Great work environment, friendly people

Cons: Cuts last year don’t align with culture messages and create a lot of stress. New procedures are constantly changing yet scrutinized by leadership when “incorrectly “ applied

Cons: The firings of the last 9 months, coupled with senior leadership being tone deaf, is grating on everyone's nerves. Some folks are getting unhealthy with the stress. TONS more scrutiny on milestones in sales. People are exhausted.
Advice: Stop acting like we're broke. Give us travel money, to visit customers, so we can rebuild relationships which have frayed for 4 years during the pandemic. Other companies encourage travel and therefore win deals.

Pros: Culture, Flexibility, teamwork, Diversification, workload

Cons: Toxic culture at the top that trickles down to the Field It is common knowledge that if you are a 50+ white male you will be passed over for internal roles and promotions I was used for interview fodder on multiple occasions (10+ times) before being laid off Microsoft is WOKE to the detriment of its employees and customer
Advice: I would clean house of all the WOKE Executive and HR Kool-Aid drinkers The culture of employee on employee competition leads to inefficiencies and when they are stack ranked (limited rewards that are given out with a slider bar managers have to use to model reward disbursement). Making your number is not enough, it comes down to "how you compared to your peers" and whether or not you are in a protected class.

Pros: -great coworkers and good team culture -Decent WLB - work is interesting (at times)

Also another company suffering from going "woke." And of course, recently, bonuses were revoked despite record profits.

Cons: Long hours, management needs more involvement and transparency with team members
Advice: better communication and involvement with team members
Pros: Great Pay, Awesome team members,

Cons: The hierarchy is incredibly vertical meaning that there are a ton of ranks you can climb and studios that have longer histories have a lot more people who are high ranking that dont actually contribute to the project and end up making poor choices or none at all. Many times they are hard to find or communicate with because they are either not in the office or theyre tucked away in unknown meetings. They'll use cool catchphrases like 'we're working towards a process that allows us to make decisions faster' but that meeting often lasts way too long. They roll out a new structure that everyone has to follow and it disrupts everyone. Rinse and repeat every quarter or so. It's pretty insane tbh.
Advice: Have more leaders who are also individual contributors. If you have more than 25% of your team leadership spending the entire week in meetings, they aren't actually in tune with whats going on in the trenches.
Pros: Compensation package and perks are amazing Plenty of work to do and ways to create value for the company Able to level up your career in multiple ways

Cons: tech bros live here. lot's of talk but not a lot of 'walk' when it comes to DEI. culture shift was great for the first few years of Satya, but now it's changed. Engineering teams are not diverse enough. PMs are undervalued. Too many politics and work overload.
Advice: figure out better ways to recognize folks and drive transparency around performance review and promotion tracks.

Cons: - A lot of corporate red tape
Advice: None
Pros: - Fantastic teams who work in collaboration - Great pay - World Class benefits - Amazing office - Control over career growth

Cons: The company culture can be artificial feeling, meaning that part of your compensation is tied to how good of an employee you are. That means that people tend say they'd love to help you as that would help demonstrate they are a good employee.
Advice: My immediate leadership was fantastic. Keep doing what you're doing.
Pros: Let's face it, prestige. In addition, the benefits are top notch, and the people in general are all professional and good at what they do.

Pros: Good work life balance and allows hybrid option

Cons: From what I hear, not all organizations within MS are the same. I, however, have only seen one. In my org, we have a codebase that is truly unpleasant to work with. It is bad in every imaginable way, from size, to readability, to performance, to architecture. What makes this worse is the fact that engineers are expected to do the work of product and project managers as well as DevOps. That's in addition to our own work. Theoretically we have product people, but I've never seen them do anything useful except maybe some really high-level stuff. Everything that a PM does in any other company, your team is expected to do. You will see a lot of people who've been at MS for decades. They've not seen much else, or have seen it so long ago that they have no understanding of the current state of tech. And because they've been here for so long, they have a lot of weight. That's why that codebase is such a disaster and why it will remain a disaster despite constant efforts and initiatives to improve it. No architect is ever gonna say "I messed up, this is all bad, delete it" or "We decided to use tech X because it seemed cool, but we don't actually know how to use it, so we applied it in the same exact way as we know how to apply the old tech Y". And despite tech X actually being awesome, the team produced a monstrosity because all they know is tech Y and reading a couple of tutorials didn't help. To be fair, there are a lot of smart people here, who care about code quality, but the higher a person gets in rank, the more they care about looking important and covering their own behind. The company itself is gigantic and therefore a bureaucratic nightmare with proportional amounts of Kool-Aid being distributed. After the layoffs we are expected to "do more with less" (as if that wasn't already the case) and we won't get a cost-of-living pay increase this year because of "difficult economic situation and uncertainty". That was announced a few weeks after a record-breaking profits announcement. There is also an eternal corporate song in the air, about supporting the latest trend. At the moment it's diversity, inclusion, equity, social justice, etc. Obviously, the company doesn't actually care, none of them do, but it has to project an appearance or be eaten alive on Twitter. So just smile and wave and you'll be fine. Overall, it's just another large corporation. You can have an amazing experience, or you can have a terrible experience. It all depends purely on the org/team that you end up in/on.
Advice: None
Pros: Good teammates, depending on team. The salary is better than those of most startups. The stock is not just lottery tickets unlike most startups.

Cons: - Microsoft is highly risk averse from a legal standpoint because they get sued so often with such a big target on their back, which often results in mandatory inefficiencies, overcomplication, and job frustration for the sake of strict compliance - Highly visible, publicly traded company that is constantly being criticized by investors and not immune to their pressure to influence business decisions towards short-term profitability staying in a double-digit growth rate in lieu of long-term gains; hence the massive, global 5% workforce layoff - Overly progressive and woke, at times, but the most reasonable of the big tech companies by far
Advice: Please keep those cons above in mind and don't be afraid to continue pushing back with your influence.
Pros: - Amazing &amp; fun culture - Transparent &amp; caring leadership - Career growth opportunity - Top of market compensation (or very close, if you include stock) - Benefits can't be beat - Financially well-positioned for long-term growth with such a diverse product portfolio - Realistic and effective DEI plan and approach

Pros: -good atmosphere
-Definitely a job you can like

Cons: Compared to its competitors, Microsoft consistently offers lower pay, particularly for business disciplines.

Because of the focus on improving culture, it takes longer to become a people manager, which can be a con if that's important to you.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft is an all-around solid choice if you want to go into big tech. It has the prestige and respect to open doors throughout your career, and enough departments to ensure you're constantly growing in your discipline. Company culture and values are solid--and there's a real effort to improve, even if pockets of the old company (a place that was aggressive, Type A, competitive, and gate keep-y) still exist. I'm proud of the work we do and don't feel like I'm contributing to a worse-off world.

Cons: There was one guy they brought in to lead Production at the end of the project. He was the worst Manager I ever saw. He knew very little about Production and drove the team into the ground. $ichard

Cons: It's hard to get ahold of the department you need for very important issues such as payroll.
Advice: Be more diligent in communication channels with all of your associates.
Pros: I love Microsoft they are absolutely the most difficult to understand, I see building for them as a challenge though. There is nothing I can't figure out after breaking it all the way down. Super excited to see where it goes in the future and the future of web3 and AI.

Cons: Lack of knowledge of consumers Lack of knowledge of markets outside of the US Lack of brand identity frameworks Sexiest practices and Head of MSFT HR is not people oriented Lack of training for men on how to manage women, women of color, and professionals from other countries.
Advice: Inclusive environments trump diversity. If Microsoft doesn't train their management on how to treat, trust, and develop diverse leaders, all your diverse talent will end up leaving. Don't block successful women because your teams need to check the box. Don't initiate investigations to listen to our voices if your management will end up retaliating against us and find any excuse to get rid of us. Increase your salary to L67 and L68 women leaders. As far as I could see, this level lacks women and non-alpha males, let alone, women of color.

Cons: No cons, this place is great.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company and amazing people

Cons: Biggest drawback is that career growth is super slow and getting things done requires a large concerted effort across many teams, so things move slowly. This can sometimes drain energy and result in tedious work, rework, overlapping efforts, etc. Second issue is that at least currently, there is extremely limited mobility due to hiring slowdowns everywhere. Compensation is not the best compared to other big tech.

Cons: You are valuable until you aren't. I worked there for +19 years and forgot towards the end that I was just a number. It isn't a bad thing necessarily just don't get lulled into that they "care" about you. They care about creating a great environment for you to do your best work so you can drive more impact at the company. They don't actually care about you as a person beyond what you can drive for them. This is a mirror reflection of the state of companies now. Find a company that works for you - it is just a day to day value exchange.
Advice: None

Cons: Recent layoffs have hurt morale.
Advice: None
Pros: Team is always willing to help.

He left the company 5 years ago but I'm sure you can still ask him about it")

Cons: not much to con, great benefits
Advice: None
Pros: great benefits and travel reloc

Cons: Advancement faces competition due to a high concentration of talented employees and strict focus on controlling budget. Since 2020, isolation can be pretty bad, particularly for remote ICs who don't depend on others for their day-to-day (i.e. Software Engineers) or those in different locations. Lack of variety can be an issue, with work occasionally feeling repetitive or mundane. Internal politics and bureaucracy can sometimes be a major drain, causing massive churn and headaches for ICs just trying to do their job. Growing disconnect between frontline employees and executives this year following poor management of mass layoffs, creating an atmosphere of mistrust. Aggressive cost-cutting measures being effected this year, perceived as needless, have impacted employee compensation and benefits, further straining the relationship with executive leadership.
Advice: The influence of Satya Nadella's leadership on Microsoft has been unquestionably transformative and has mostly led to significant improvements in the company's performance and culture. However, it's concerning that there seems to be a shift in the level of respect and engagement with employees, particularly in light of the recent layoffs. The pride that Microsoft employees once held for their company appears to be waning. To foster an improved individual contributor (IC) experience, Microsoft leadership should consider the following: In times of truly necessary workforce adjustment, ensure transparent and compassionate handling of layoffs. This would alleviate anxiety and maintain the dignity and morale of all employees. No employee should ever be informed of their position being eliminated over a video call, which was my unfortunate experience. Continually enhance learning and career advancement opportunities. This includes fully funded travel for remote employees for morale or collaboration weeks. Address the advancement competition and budget constraints. Quarterly promotion cycles have improved the situation, but a more substantial promotion budget could help further. Efforts should be made to ensure that employees do not need to leave and return (boomerang) for advancement. Foster an environment that encourages creativity and variety in work, such as through job rotations, shadowing opportunities, or more project-based work. The Hackathons are an excellent initiative but extending such principles into daily work could be beneficial. Minimize internal politics and bureaucracy. Emphasize transparency, collaboration, and accountability, and reassess the necessity and effectiveness of multiple layers of middle management. Open and honest dialogue about these topics at all levels can lead to a healthier work environment.
Pros: Dramatic improvements to Engineering culture, as well as general organizational culture since Nadella took over as CEO. Provides competitive compensation and extensive benefits packages. Opportunities for learning and career advancement span across various domains and technologies. Demonstrates corporate social responsibility through substantial philanthropy and sustainability initiatives. Global presence leads to work on meaningful and challenging projects with substantial impact. Flexibility for global relocation available, coupled with strong immigration support.

Pros: Good people, benefits, and flexibility

Cons: Depending on your manager, you can be gone anytime even you do your best, I was told that by the manager, you should come back because you showed your best and still the team got to be cut in budget
Advice: Work is importal but LIFE as well. Worst part, is that it's about the manager that creates the environmnet of the team. I had great experience/fun with first manager, then another manager coming asking me indirectly to work beyond working hours, refusing once

Advice: None
Pros: Very cushy company with a nice benefit package that makes it a tough decision to leave

Cons: Lower level managers and supervisors obsessed with metrics instead of results. Especially any metrics which reflect on them. Many would rather make you do something a**-backwards because it looks good on a report.
Advice: Big organizations are difficult, because how do you assess employee performance without reducing everyone to metrics which can be gamed? I don't know, but giving employees more freedom to choose an approach will motivate them to come up with novel solutions and outside the box thinking. As things are everything is very 'top down'.
Pros: Many knowledgeable and hardworking collogues. Very friendly and professional.

Advice: None
Pros: Good managers, genuine people. Knowledge sharing environment. Step forward in the career. You will learn a great amount skills and grow as an engineer. Good culture, no micro management.

Cons: Not Hybrid or remote - While I understand the reasoning, the option for hybrid work is unmatched. Layoffs - At the moment - and of no fault of MS - we are in an economic uncertainty which has required them to make some difficult choices. This has everyone on edge with no knowing if they will have a position from day to day.
Advice: Continue to support your teams in the way that they need to be supported. Management is not only about delegating tasks, but also about the development of your team members.
Pros: Flexibility - The hours of work really allow for flexibility as long as deadlines are met. Benefits - Some of the best benefits in the market Culture - While I can't speak for every Org, my org truly had one of the best and most supportive cultures. My PM focused on personal and professional development and wellness during every conversation. Pay - Self explanatory.

Cons: Not sure if there's major cons
Advice: None
Pros: Good culture, learning resources, great benefit

Cons: Constantly in churn where no one knows what to do and how you do your job. If you aren't an "own it" type of person that needs to be told what to do, it is a rough onboarding process. Very little hand holding. Imposter syndrome is real, and in this environment you'll feel it.... and feel alone at times.
Advice: Too soon to say. My manager is awesome (I think he is an M2. We have no M1 currently.)
Pros: Tons of great people to partner with. Someone knows what you don't, and is willing to help. Benefits are amazing. Accommodations for disabilities, including ADHD/ND. Lots of support around mental health. Unlimited time off. Not micromanaged, and you can own your business and chart your ship.

Cons: Depending on the team and manager you land with, it can be very cliques. (Group of individuals who act more like a secret society).

Pros: Great environment and benefits. Great people and culture

Cons: This place drives anxiety and depression with its employees. Innovation is frowned upon unless you are one of a very few elite. Most people here are all about looking good instead of doing good. If you have a bad manager you're done. Find a new one asap. A good manager is better than a good role here.
Advice: I had a manager who wasn't comfortable with a direct report having big impact. These insecure middle managers are what's wrong with Microsoft. They stifle inclusivity, productivity, and innovation. I highly recommend devising an innovative model for management. Something like contributors getting to choose their manager without penalty. It might seem extreme, but the company would be much better for it.
Pros: Great opportunity to network and learn new things. Good pay and benefits also.

Pros: Amazing benefits and Competitive salary.

Cons: So far i don’t see any cons
Advice: None
Pros: Work balance is extremely well

Cons: Leadership that yells in meetings. High turnover rate on projects. Poor senior leadership accountability that leads to turnover. Constantly moving goal posts for project goals. Managers that throw people under the bus to protect themselves, lack of leadership accountability, continued promotion of the same people that have been working in the group for 8-12 years. Studio GM that doesn't understand games. Poorly staffed (understaffed projects). Poor work/life balance (generally 70+ hour weeks). Luckily I wasn't impacted, but layoffs are a constant fear that could severely impact your family and living.
Advice: Take accountability for your decisions. Don't expect external developers to eat the costs for you forgetting project agreements and changing design every 6 months. Don't tell your employees taking over mismanaged projects that they won't be blamed for them and then blame them. Stop the group culture of complaining loudly and throwing others under the bus.

Advice: None
Pros: Some of the compensation packages Microsoft provides are very good (s.a. health insurance, ...). Additionally, the Redmond campus is beautiful.

Cons: You need to know how to navigate intense amounts of ambiguity. While you can spread your wings, you may not get much guidance as to how. Microsoft also operates on quite a bit of tribal knowledge, making it more difficult for folks who are coming in from the outside.
Advice: Two crafts worthy of formalized investment - Project Management &amp; Organizational Design. You can thank me later.
Pros: There's more than enough work to go around. There's so much opportunity to spread one's wings that spreading them effectively becomes a needed skill.

Cons: It has been a constant trend since the start of 2023, the workload doubled or even tripled, however, with the hard work and increased work load, there is no merit for all this year, and our org finds it difficult to promotion people this year. It’s like work extremely hard but all for nothing.

Pros: bEST COMMUNITY TO BE HEARD AND VALUED

Cons: Need more transparency around layoffs, it is not nice to tell everyone there's going to be layoffs and let them wait for 3 months to see if they are safe or not. High separation between engineering and business. Collaboration between both could be better.
Advice: None
Pros: The caring for the employees, even when being let go. I was still able to do a comfortable transition by allowing to keep the badge and work device for an additional week. Also, was left on payroll for two months which is a huge help to find a new job on a visa. The culture is very respectful and inclusive, and the benefits are really good! Also, they really seem to listen to the feedback which they get from regular polls.

Cons: Work life balance can be an issue
Advice: None
Pros: Interesting and innovative work on the devices side

Cons: Grow is really depends on team
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance, good benefits and team event

Cons: The status quo is the status quo, not a lot of opportunity to go far with things, and you just may get cut from mass lay offs because you were just unlucky. Not the place I'd make a satisfying career, with management being a only them party, and the only way to make headway on any product is to get management to make it a task, elsewise it'll never get done, because there's no incentive to go the extra mile. It's a boring place, with amazing benefits, if that's what you want you can find it there.
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing pay, benefits package and wonderful coworkers.

Cons: Less impact due to size of the company
Advice: None

Pros: Good benefits, decent salary, decent WLB depending on your team.

Pros: People, new culture/direction under Satya

Cons: Good work life balance depending on the manager
Advice: None
Pros: Some bad toxic managers are there

Cons: Typical big company motions. Slow move to change, difficult to move/get promoted internally. Senior leadership claims empathy but doesn't seem to care, very robotic e on addressing pay/layoff concerns despite being a constant issue during company polls.
Advice: Actually emphathize with your employees and offer better compensation.
Pros: Good benefits and training opportunities depending on which organization you work in. Lots of great low/middle management. Great work life balance

Cons: - micromanaging (depends on the person really) - sometimes you won't get support from your superiors - lots of cold calling and doing your own lead generation
Advice: None
Pros: - growth opportunity - job is enjoyable if you like sales (I just personally don't like sales) - team is great - physical location is great

Cons: - Layoffs have been rough, and we are not getting any merit increase this year. This has hurt morale a lot. There are a lot of people working hard and were looking forward to some sort of raise. - MSFT is a machine of a million gears, some bigger than others. You have to accept that you can only impact so many gears around you, and if you want to expand your network you have to make a concerted effort to do so. - There are always some people who make it through the cracks in hiring. Thankfully, I think that is less the case at MSFT, but still, it happens. I just wish we were more rigorous in some aspects of hiring, especially for non-technical roles.
Advice: Take care of your employees and reward them! We are doing great as a company and yet you think it's a good idea to take away merit increases in a year of high inflation? And announce this RIGHT after Signals survey ends? This is NOT how you reward performance and I thought MSFT was a "pay for performance" company.
Pros: - Great "deal" if you negotiate comp right. My team works very hard and is always engaged, but our manager makes sure we have adequate rest and recovery days and we load balance. - This is very subjective, but I've had great middle managers. They model, coach, and care and I'm very grateful to have such good immediate management here. - You work with brilliant people daily. For the most part, everyone here works hard and wants to help you out. Those who don't are real outliers and get spotted out quickly. You have to learn how to be a team player here. - The benefits are world-class. MSFT health care is the best I've had by far of all my employers.

Cons: Executive leadership has handled the layoffs extremely badly. Announcing layoffs rolled out at an unknown frequency over an extended period. Limited, sporadic communications. It's like water torture. Can only conclude that management no longer cares. Would have been better to do them all at once rather than letting them linger. Beyond toxic for morale. Lots of talk about empathy being a core value. And then the least empathetic thing possible.
Advice: Understand the long-term impact of your actions. Business conditions, even macroeconomic ones, are cyclical. At some point you will want to grow again but will have attrition of people you don't want to leave. And won't have internal referrals.
Pros: Good products and technologies. Decent benefits.

Cons: Work might not be as exciting as a startup, and you need to work your way into harder engineering projects
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, fantastic work culture that promotes growth. Very kind to their employees, and work is super motivating

Cons: Layoffs. If you're going to do them, don't make a one-time announcement that they will be recurring over the next n months. Better transparency of the job elimination process and criteria. Also, if I'm calculating correctly, my severance pay is an embarrassment. Especially given my tenure (18 years).
Advice: There has to be a more humane and effective way to handle the challenges precipitating layoffs. You're losing great talent and irreplaceable IP. There is no depth of knowledge in the areas I handled, leaving my former team in a position to risk failure, accuracy issues and delays.
Pros: Access to new Microsoft technology, autonomy, management support, exciting work, benefits

Cons: manager is not good. just know launch new projects, never consider fixing the exsited problems

Pros: The company is very diverse and does its best to maintain a healthy work environment. There are lots of company perks such as reimbursement for healthy purchases. They hit the best they can and it cultivated a culture of growth. Everyone is doing their best to be empathic to each order and our customers.

Cons: More responsibility should be given to every individual
Advice: None
Pros: Good company. Had a good environment of growth

Cons: Like at any company, some teams are better funded/ supported than others. Some teams are "startup-like" and those tend to be more chaotic and turbulent, with managers overworking people and coworkers throwing one another under the bus to show "impact". Microsoft is not immune to bureaucratic dysfunction.
Advice: Focus on growing &amp; retaining good management.
Pros: The benefits were fantastic, and most of the managers and coworkers I had there were some of the smartest, kindest people you could hope to work with. For the majority of my time at MS my work-life-balance was great. Internal mobility is usually frictionless (although recent economic conditions have certainly made opportunities more limited).

Cons: Hours can be continuous - 24/7, recent trends toward cost reduction.

Cons: A lot of bureaucracy due to size.
Advice: None
Pros: Very good work like balance.

Cons: At this large of an organization you’re just a number to the SLT when it comes to layoffs regardless of performance or skill.

Pros: Microsoft has great work life balance and a great company to work with.

Cons: As you go higher up in the company there are a lot of politics and egos to navigate. The company is quite siloed. The data can be a mess. The pressure and expectations are high. Long hours and loads of meetings aren't uncommon. Recent hiring freezes and mass layoffs. Lots of outsourcing and offshoring. Partner's are concerned about eroding incentives and conflicts of interest. Frustratingly complicated buying processes (too many products/agreement types, etc.) and poor customer service/support. Not very nimble.
Advice: None
Pros: Most of the people are amazing. They're smart, driven, diverse and inclusive, etc. The product portfolio is vast, some are market leaders others are newer/lesser known. Strong brand recognition, and one of the top players in the industry. Great senior leadership, with values and vision for the future. Above average total compensation.

Cons: You have to seek out these opportunities, take control of your career path.

Pros: Regular training for compliance, but more importantly training to elevate my craft in sourcing and recruiting. We were encouraged to join outside groups and associations and we had a budget to do so for anyone on our team.

Cons: Cases can often be stressful, and customers are very demanding. Customer meetings easily can take an hour or so often I needed to multi-task or work overtime to catch up.
Advice: They only reach out if something is wrong. Managers only contact you if you're falling behind on SLA.
Pros: Most supportive, most professional group of engineers I've worked with. Company Culture allows you to learn and make mistakes. Every one of my fellow engineers really values learning.

Cons: A lot of projects move very slowly
Advice: None
Pros: Very good combination of products line

Cons: Career growth can sometimes get stagnated by less than interesting work that has more business impact.

Pros: Really good work life balance and supportive culture

Cons: Started at the company when I was really young at entry level. Leveling up internally is challenging. In most cases, there are only lateral moves if you get a new job internally. Annual reviews/promotions have to be fought for by a manager that is willing to speak up for you. On average it takes several years just to grow one level. Needs senior management and HR to review and approve two level jumps. External new hires are being hired into the company at market standard rates and levels and the internal employees are fighting to be level set at the ever changing market standards.

Cons: Culture is Terrible for Women. Executive Leaders say one thing but there is zero support for women in the field. If you speak up you will get blacklisted not supported. Too many biased process and yearly reviews are the worst.

Advice: Follow company values, they are more than just words. Treat your admins like a member of your team, a strategic business partner. Your admin makes sure you have bathroom breaks and blocks time for you to spend time with your family. Your admin likely spends more time caring for you than they do for themselves.

Cons: Over hired during Covid and now going through massive rolling layoffs. Companies like Microsoft have so much money and made an obscene amount during the pandemic. Due to poor forecasting from leadership, teams of people are let go. Doesn’t matter if you’re a rockstar performer. In the end you’re just a number. Also, for such a massive respected company they are a mess. Siloed and bureaucratic. This was once my dream company to work for but in reality it was probably one of the worst.

Cons: None at the moment from me
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, have great team members and manager, and work life balance

Cons: The interview process for externals is ridiculous. It took me a year from my first interview with zero interim communication until a finals day. I accepted another job and worked someplace else for 10 months before the second round of interviews even began. Internal hiring is equally abysmal, with little to no opportunity for internal movement due to various quota requirements. M1's are literally unable to help you at all. They have no power except forwarding your complaints or concerns to someone who doesn't care to listen--by which time you are persona non grata for not toeing the company line. The work schedule can be grueling, especially if you support multiple timezones. You have to defend your time off and refuse to justify it. During every round of layoffs, you have no idea where you rank. As someone who has had multiple published works, shipping products, involved in community leadership, nominated multiple times for Gold and Platinum club (internal awards), speaking engagements on behalf of MS, highest possible evaluations in Connects (internal review process), and internal mentoring, not to mention years in sales exceeding quotas by 100% or more, I would have thought that I would be valued or given the opportunity to move to a new role. Your contributions aren't valued more than you most recent 1:1 with your manager. Don't spend your life laboring for an organization that does not recognize or reward for sacrifice or above-and-beyond work.
Advice: Transparency. Since leaving, I have had a steady stream of former coworkers contacting me on that are perpetually living in fear of not knowing the criteria for layoffs/reductions, what they can do to protect themselves, or if it's truly random. It's a deathly toxic environment, leading to loss of productivity. Everyone is watching Blind for the latest worrisome news instead of contributing to the bottom line. You need grief counselors for day-to-day employees.
Pros: - Access to some of the latest tools in the marketplace - Great peer networking - Easy to find technical help when you're stuck

Cons: hard to switch career paths and not clear guidance for career growth

It was insulting.

Advice: None
Pros: The "deal" is incredible from salary to benefits to stocks and bonuses. The opportunity to work with really intelligent business professionals had me dealing with a bit of imposter syndrome at first but it encourages you to shift gears and step up your game and understand that you're just as capable.

Cons: Compensation is extremely drastic from one role to another and as an internal employee, sometimes it can feel impossible to make large jump in compensation regardless of role advancement.
Advice: None
Pros: Every person will have their own unique experience with any company regardless of size or clout. My experience with Microsoft has been steady and I've always felt very well taken care of as an employee.

Cons: hard to get promoted if your team has a lot senior/principle engineers
Advice: None
Pros: work life balance is good

Cons: Executive decisions on laying off mass amounts of people
Advice: cut executive pay to keep lay offs at bay
Pros: Compensation Benefits Work life balance DE&amp;I engagement

Cons: MS talks a lot about great Leaders, internally and to the outside world, about their core priorities to “model, coach, care”. Unfortunately, that wasn’t my experience! Without a leader who truly cares about your growth and success, is the beginning of what can make or break you here. Joining MS is a huge challenge. Without the proper onboarding and leadership support, you can sink quickly. MS is a Tech giant, so this doesn’t apply to all leaders. There are some great leaders there. Just something to pay close attention to as you start your journey.
Advice: None
Pros: Excellent Benefits &amp; Perks Great learning and bonding with Team members Products/Solutions are top notch Nice variation of Employee Resource Groups to join for support

Cons: Big tech is imploding and job loss is inevitable.
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of challenges and great teammates.

Cons: Promotion velocity is slow, and the pay is not super competitive.
Advice: Focus on retaining current talent. I see a lot of people leaving post-pandemic. The company seems to have the attitude to not care about people who are "not loyal to Microsoft". But not everyone who leaves is disloyal.
Pros: Microsoft feels like a company which is interested in your growth. Managers are trained about helping you achieve more, how to get you projects that you're interested in. And there is enough diversity of work / businesses within the company, that you don't have to leave to switch disciplines.

Cons: Total package of compensation was not competive.
Advice: None
Pros: Great vision, did the right things in cloud and AI.

Cons: I'm not a current nor or former employee
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft is a company that

Cons: I was laid off after 11 months at Microsoft along with other 30 people. I just woke up and lost my job in one day because of a business decision. I chose this career, it is what is is, it comes at a risk.
Advice: I hope they work more closely with engineers and would give advice and warnings if possible. I did not have any sign from my manager. There was nothing I or my manager can change to secure my job.
Pros: Great people, amazing team. You will get help when you ask for it. Lots of opportunities to learn. Lots of benefits and perk+ was really nice.

Cons: refresh is pretty low，relative lower salary on the market compared to similar level company

Pros: people, work, balance, process, perks

Cons: Pay is mediocre, career growth is slow.
Advice: None
Pros: WFB is good, tech area is interesting.

Cons: *Work life balance is pretty bad. They pay me 60% more than my previous job, but they make me work nearly 80-100% more. Working 10-12 hrs a day is normal. Deadlines are too aggressive. *Not a fan of the way layoffs are being handled currentl. Veterans who hve spent 20 years in the company are getting locked out of PCs abruptly. But then again, that seems to be the norm these days with all major organizations.
Advice: Stop creating artificial pressures on your teams by making up unrealistic targets and deadlines. It burns them out.
Pros: *Smart helpful co-workers *great benefits, though less compensation compared to peers Google and Amazon. *Good projects and wide array of teams to move internally

Cons: None that could be seen

Advice: None
Pros: Good work Life Balance and benefits except salary

Cons: nothing really, it was just time
Advice: None
Pros: Very enriching and a comfortable environment

Cons: There’s a reason Microsoft invented Teams to replace flights in the first place. Flying halfway around the world for a one-hour meeting is a huge waste of time and resources – nearly 1 in 3 business travelers find it difficult to stay on top of their workload when traveling. Polling in Europe has shown around 3 in 4 business workers think recent air travel restrictions had no effect or a positive effect on productivity. Frequent business travel has been linked to burnout – nearly a quarter of business travelers say they have to work more to make up for lost time while traveling. Business flights can especially lead to added stress for single parents, who have to find childcare for their kids. This is something Microsoft should be especially worried about given its own research recently found 41% of the global workforce is considering leaving their employer this year.
Advice: I implore management at Microsoft to advocate for more intracompany meetings to take place via Teams. This will help the climate crisis while making your directs much happier campers.
Pros: As someone who worked in Global HR at Microsoft, I have seen the amount of travel that Microsoft employees do; so much of it is unnecessary. Microsoft invented Teams in part so that people don't need to travel by air for business so often. Microsoft already knows flights are terrible for the climate – that’s why it’s been offsetting its flights and investing in sustainable jet fuels. But offsets are deeply flawed and sustainable aviation fuels are so expensive that the airline industry has consistently failed to meet its own targets for sustainable fuel use over the decades. If Microsoft wants to be a real climate leader, it must scrap all but the most necessary flights from its travel policy.

Cons: Slow paced Lot of senior people in one team
Advice: None
Pros: Great work life balance here Great company

Cons: Undergoing some destructive leadership changes and reorganizing. Some of the passion has been lost.
Advice: Changing too many things at one time without proper change management is causing more chaos than should be expected from such a market leading company. Satya's vision is sound as is his company culture, but new leadership scrapping what worked and trying to do things from scratch without consideration for institutional knowledge and what works in a company like Microsoft, is causing the troops to lose faith and commitment.
Pros: Great vision and value to the world as a whole. Breadth of products and capabilities

Cons: No mobility or upward trajectory Repetitive and no plans to reduce burn out
Advice: None
Pros: Awesome Company, Benefits, Pay, Perks, Training, People

Advice: None
Pros: Company offers great benefits to employees

Cons: You're trading work life balance for salary. Keep that in mind as you negotiate in. Once in getting hired locally anywhere other than another hyperscaler is difficult. They just assume you are unaffordable. I've been told that repeatedly.

Cons: Salary is low, we need more pay
Advice: None
Pros: Best culture and vibe, cool projects

Cons: Too many layers of management that lack vision and direction. No one is held accountable for their areas which cause very broad and ambiguous roles. Can get exhausting trying to chase people down to get things done. Scope is very small and limited, I see no room for growth in my role. Management and leadership is very poor and I sense a lot of age-ism and favoritism.
Advice: Identify and drive clarity on vision and direction for your team. Create and build relationships with partner orgs and hold each other accountable. Make sure that middle managers are executing on the vision and managing their team properly.
Pros: Great benefits, work-life balance, can really grow and expand your network here

Advice: None
Pros: Very happy here love it

Cons: limited growth, corporate nepotism is real
Advice: not likely
Pros: WLB is good because there is little accountability to actually work

Cons: Massive problems with discrimination and no accountability from HR. Racism, sexism, harrasment you name it. Also, low pay compared to competition. A lot of coddling of golden boys. Many men don't do any work and keep being rewarded. Senior management makes a lot of questionable decisions and their word is final. Promotion and reward cycle is very slow and unfair.

Cons: Employee morale is at an all time role. Heavily, heavily monitored hourly/daily movement tracked. Excessive, heavy handed oversight of day to day progress.
Advice: I don't know that there is an opportunity to contribute. Suggestions are not well received and/are often condoned. Implied gratitude (To the employee's) from above mgmt. is usually the response.

Cons: Working at MS was very stressful. I developed stress-induced medical issues and had to quit. My org was explicitly told they weren't allowed to hire any more white or asian men, only women and/or black/hispanic.
Advice: If you truly value diversity, you wouldn't be pushing out men, whites &amp; asians, and conservatives. You're trading one narrow view for another.

Cons: Lots of travel can be a grind
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of opportunity for exposure and partner engagement.

Cons: 0 Work-life balance. Managers are always after KPIs and often fail to acknowledge the burden front-line engineers face with. Middle management especially M1s in technical support is the weakest area for Microsoft. They get comfortable in their roles and lack empathy. They don't advance their skills and try to get themselves familiar with what their team is supporting so it's hard to communicate with them and make them understand what we are trying to accomplish as a team.
Advice: None
Pros: Everyone is so talented and hard-working. Microsoft encourages a growth mindset and commits to making its employees grow along with the company.

Cons: Work life balance is a challenge

Pros: The benefits are better than most

Cons: They could lay you off at any time
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and great work life balance

Cons: Non-transparent layoff procedures. Not awesome.
Advice: Layoffs of the little people are hardly ever the solution (beyond the optics show it puts on for share holders). You efficiency comes directly from your middle management. Get those folks in shape and you see double productivity.
Pros: My team was the best. My manager was to die for. I can only hope my next role has such a great group surrounding it.

Cons: too many layers, hard to get things done quickly
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Awesome place to work, great culture

Cons: Too fast paced and changing priority
Advice: None
Pros: Great company, growth and reward

Cons: Products span across many engineering teams. Agile (self-organized) framework means that you need to re-establish processes for every new investment. Slow to take fresh ideas due to conflicts with LT plans. Product usability is incredibly poor with low traction on solving.
Advice: None
Pros: Core priority is diversity and inclusion. Values accessibility. Products span global markets including federal government. Flexible work schedule. Hybrid working locations (including 100% remote). Plentiful perks and bonusing opportunities.

Cons: Middle Management needs more work to become better culture stewards and leaders. Leadership needs to be more than managing teams of people and doing individual contributor work.
Advice: Middle manager roles need a revamp. The focus of these roles needs to become one of more stewardship with a focus on engaging a team of individuals to meet/exceed designated goals with both honest and open communication, interest in each team member, an open mind, while using innovation to increase impact at all levels.
Pros: Focus on growth mindset and learning. Direction from Senior Leadership Team. Continued focus on employee feedback process.

Pros: Worklife balance Good income Training

Cons: Lack of leadership and overall direction for how the company needs to change in order to meet its objectives. Company does not live its values.
Advice: The stated company culture focuses on a growth mindset, but in reality what I experienced was a closed mindset especially from more veteran team members that had been in Microsoft for a while. I would highly encourage leadership to get more active in eliciting different points of view especially from your team members and then wholeheartedly endorsing changes which align with the companies stated objectives for Change and growth.
Pros: Pay and benefits are fantastic.

Cons: - Bureaucracy - "Engineer is king" mentality (can be good if you're an engineer, I guess) Pros and cons can vary wildly depending on your immediate team and org.
Advice: For the most part, I think management is doing a good job. They can improve on creating a better policy for digital nomads.
Pros: - Good benefits - Culture around diversity and inclusion - Has a big employee-led community on Sustainability
