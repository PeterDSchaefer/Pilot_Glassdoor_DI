Cons: Passion to help fix holes in routines established there seems to really threaten management.  Poor communication and direction from boss to direct reports. Indecisive back and forth decision-making and vague instruction without real strategy considered leaves you having to choose between kissing up to boss or doing your best at the job. A large amount of responsibility without the power to make decisions to set yourself up in those responsibilities. I was thrown under the bus taking blame for my boss' decisions quite a few times. Passive aggressive type leadership. Will terminate you without stating a reason. My job description changed completely from accepting job to where I ended up, without my position title changing. Unspoken expectation to "live" there in order to get things done, despite a couple break-ins making location late at night unsafe.
Advice: "because it's always worked out/been done this way" is not a reason to continue doing something a certain way. The more efficiently a set up can be, the more efficiently many tasks can be done to create a large amount of time to do extra projects and take a business (and my strengths/weaknesses) way beyond where it is. Also, employees who are passionate are not a threat, but should inspire you. I have never cared so much about a position in my life and felt punished for speaking up about real concerns and obstacles.
Pros: The job itself has very fun responsibilities, good benefits, around average/ slightly below average pay, fun culture at shows, events and meetings, indirect inspirational type of leadership overall expressed frequently through posted quotes, perks, thank you meals etc,( I'd still want the job back more than anything if under different leadership)

Cons: Because of the fast moving and entrepreneurial approach to work, there is little in the way of set processes that a person can follow.  Getting started here can be overwhelming until you  build your own network of experts and helpers.     I don't know if it is the whole company or just the  area I am in but managing workload and priorities is not done well.   This is a work in progress as it is a recognized problem but it is hard to enforce processes in a culture that has always been fueled on individualistic influence.    Finding the balance between execution on inspired ideas and working on the highest priorities is a tough job.
Advice: Our company ethics are an inspiration in these times of eroding social responsibility.    Keep  going!  We really do have to get better at prioritizing work especially balancing between the various divisions.   Shared service groups are overwhelmed by the competing demands of the divisions and functions.
Pros: Fast and challenging  environment, it is never boring or mundane.  The company's social responsibility is a thing of pride to all of us and they do really take care of their employees in terms of benefits and job security.   For people who love an unstructured work approach and are OK with managing their own time, it is a great place.   I genuinely love this company.   There are no corporate drones here, individuals are appreciated and the company culture allows for different personalities and styles.

Cons: At the end of the day it's all about who likes you and has your back, in particular when it comes to your boss. 
HR is the worse out there. Do not trust them, whatever they say. Anything and everything will be used against you down the line. 
At the end of the day employees are just numbers, and replaceable, no one cares about how it is really going and if you have a work life balance. A 15hr day is normal and rare are the GM's who let you comp the weekends you worked or traveled.
Advice: 360 reviews in order for the bad management to be penalized. To date it's all about what your N+1 or 2 thinks about you and HR doesn't care if it's personal even if you do a great job and have performed for years. Be honest, be fare! Treat people with respect and let them express themselves especially when they bring up a problem with their boss instead of burying it. The whole US organization needs a serious HR overall and the people they picked for that are the worst part of the system. People are not happy and too afraid to say it.
Pros: The people are incredible, creative and smart no doubt some of the best talents in the industry. It's one of the most creative environments out there and that's very exciting.

Cons: The quarter year management shifts, rearrange everything and upset the apple cart when they occur approximately every 4 years or so.  Many of the long time employees are cycled out and new younger employees are cycled in.  With that many long term employees, this is truly a tough place to say goodbye to.
Advice: Don't forget about the needs of the loyal and dedicated long term seniour employees as you court new younger talent.  Both have many assets.
Pros: L'Oreal USA represents the best and the brightest of our society.  It is a classically diversified company with a plethora of products, positions, plans and people!  There is always a new project going on and they are widely respected in their industry, strive to make the work experience a great event for all of their employees, and work to attain a great work like balance for everyone.  They try to keep the door open to fresh talent and make room for them.  Many of the employees become long term employees and are very proud of their work longevity.

Cons: - One of those companies where there are "Kings" and "queens" and you have to kiss the ring.  GMs and operational heads are treated as gods and can make or destroy your career regardless of your talent and achievements.
- Steep learning curve (significant percentage of new hires don't survive the first year). 
- French culture strongly influences L'Oreal USA.  
- Expect emotional outbursts in meetings which is referred to as "Passion"
- Death by 1000 Meetings 
- Slow decision making....and even after decisions are made they get revisited
Advice: The company is making strong effort to address the obvious concerns regarding employees morale. This is a positive move but we are yet to see the benefits and impact of such programs such as SIMPLICITY. Also, encourage your senior management to be more humble and treat other with the deserved respect.
Pros: + Successful company with proud history and stability
+ Pension plan (not many companies still offer it)
+ Global presence opens opportunities to work in many different areas
+ There are some very smart people in this company and you can learn a lot from them (even if some processes are not smart)
+ Summer hours, volunteering, work from home, and other good programs

Cons: 1. VP's have no long term strategy  
2. Goal is to move orders from the next month up, and stuff the backdoors of customers. 
3. Long trail of emails where NAM's are spoken to in a very disrespectful manner. 
4. VP'S ask for a volume update every 2 hours, and they overcommit numbers to management to make themselves look good. 
5. Unreasonable goals that are not based on the customer. 
6. VP's scared to explain true conditions of market to SVP's.
Advice: I would advise that you let employee's have a ride along day before joining the very unorganized MCB division of Loreal. This will allow them to fully evaluate the role before joining.  I would not recommend anyone to leave a good established company to join this place. In 2015/2016 I did this and it the biggest regret that I have in life. 

With declining brands the company needs to set a strategy before the year starts. We are planning for 2017 in February of 2017. At my previous company we planned for the next year 9 to 11 months out. Strategy is top down in any organization, and right now I am very disappointed that L'Or√©al is allowing a division to operate like this.
Pros: 1. Nothing positive about being a National Account    Manager in the MCB division

Cons: Management & HR over-emphasizes the ability/benefit to transfer into other divisions or into other roles but when faced with the request to transfer to another division or internal role they are not as open.  You're wanted to be open to relocation but only on their terms.
Many "politics" at play from communication to executing promotions- the open door they speak of is not as open as it should be... especially with fear of retaliation being a real thing.
Advice: A happy employee is a more productive employee.  Try to lessen the politics behind everything- it's not motivating and listen to your teams.... also listen to what they are afraid to say and are not saying.  There is a lot of frustration that stays bottled up.
Pros: Great benefits.  Large diverse company with many other divisions to give L'OREAL a strong foot hold in the large world of cosmetics which favors job security.  Employee perks are another nice thing you don't see in other companies.  The pros from the incredible benefits outweigh the cons!

Cons: you will be challenged & stretched, make sure you are into that before you apply
Advice: Continue listening to employees, believing in them and taking bets!
Pros: I love L'Oreal!  After more than ten years with the company, I am still excited to come here each and every day.  L'Oreal has provided me with many different jobs, opportunities, career moves within many divisions and locations. My management has always believed in me, challenged me and is helping me to develop into a becoming a strategic leader.  I am surrounded by world-class talent in R&I, creative and innovative scientists that do not settle for status quo. In addition to great benefits, we also have work flexibility, summer hours and a strong management team.

Cons: Limited visibility in the company unless you work in the NY office. High likelihood that you will be managed by someone very young who has no management experience but is being "coached" often to the detriment of your own development. Managers will often take credit for your work and your ideas with no acknowledgement or appreciation for the contribution. Quality of work sometimes takes a back seat to meeting deadlines.
Advice: Realize that your older employees have not only professional experience but life experience that lends to better decision making. Stop coaching young inexperienced managers at the expense of those who know their jobs well. It's not worth losing entire departments several times over just to save one incompetent manager.
Pros: Exposure to marketing research and expertise that is second to none in the industry. The opportunity to work with some very talented and driven professionals. Great benefits and free product perks.

Cons: The marketing mentality takes over the research spirit and consequently hinders innovation. The leadership style within the company is very top-down and too autocratic. A significant portion of the workforce tends to coast and nothing is being done to address it. The meeting etiquette leaves a lot to be desired (late start, attendees showing up late, unclear goals).
Advice: Create a performance-base company culture, give more autonomy to local teams, balance the roles between R&D and marketing
Pros: Company has prestigious brands, marketing and manufacturing capability, shows commitment in sustainability and environmentally friendly products. R&D is one of the biggest in the industry.

Cons: L'Oreal likes to do more with less resources. It's a great company to work for, but you need to have a sense of urgency and time management or you will definitely feel stresses. I personally like fast paced and challenging environments, so this is a perfect fit for me.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay and benefits! L'Oreal is always looking at reinventing itself and is rolling out a new culture of Smart/Simplicity. You can feel the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit in this location. As an employee, you will be treated fairly and with respect. I couldn't ask for a better company to work for! L'Oreal North Little Rock has strong  culture and is very people oriented. It's not only about developing your technical skills, it's also about your soft skills.

Cons: Pay for FTEs appears to be consistently below market for the region, even considering benefits like pension. Don't expect to be appreciated by upper management unless you are in a highly visible sales or marketing role. HR seems more interested in seeing how little they can compensate you, rather than what you are worth in the market.
Advice: Value your talent more; they are the company's lifeblood, and if you aren't willing to compensate them enough to retain them, you'll have bigger problems. Don't just pay lip service to how much you appreciate their work, then undervalue them year over year.
Pros: On the whole, some really excellent people work at Clarisonic. The engineering groups have some very talented engineers that do great work. Work/life balance is very good in some divisions, depending on your manager.

Cons: Severely lacking retention policy.  The benefits package is good upfront, but the raises and salary adjustments are far from competitive compared to other companies in the industry.  Most chemists used their position at L'Oreal as a slot on their resume, and after 1 or 2 years would leave for something significantly higher in pay.  Additionally, while there is some mobility where you can change roles or departments, it's a double edged sword in many cases.  A manager can change from one technical department to an entirely different one, without any background knowledge or expertise in that area.  As a result, the people under the manager greatly suffer from a technical development standpoint.  Additionally, with the research area at the mercy of marketing, many projects are cancelled or funneled into continuously recirculated products from different brands that only have small changes made that have no real effect on perceived performance.  Unless you're on one of the transient groups that are in the front of the line in terms of company visibility (in today's case, the global technology incubator group), you're either stuck in complacency at your current position and barely moving, or you're swimming on the wrong side of a work life balance... just to get a skin lotion or shampoo out onto the market that's hardly innovative (even though the company loves using the word innovation to describe adding things like adding protein or honey at tiny percentages of less than 1% to already existing frame formulas and calling it new, or deconstructing competitor formulas and trying to replicate it for their own).
Advice: Address the cons above, and actually try to do something about employee dissatisfaction instead of just doing a bunch of surveys and having kumbaya meetings where people just vent their problems without any solutions being proposed or implemented.
Pros: Good benefits package overall upfront

Cons: Sink or swim mentally, marketing driven with no regard to creative departments contribution - an idea is only as good as its execution which is done by creative, creative is regarded as a service department working for marketing versus team mentality, high turn-over rate, marketing departments promote regularly and easily giving junior employees too much responsibility, HR protects upper management and sabotages everyone below, senior positions held by life-long antiquated employees who are not up to speed or current in thinking, lacks overall communication from top down creating last minute re-work and unnecessary long hours
Advice: Need leadership teams that are aligned with strong communication skills as groups work in silos creating unnecessary work and long hours
Pros: Good benefits, two bonus - corporate and divisional, 401k, vacation, half Friday's during summer months, free goods from corporate store that carries products from majority of divisions

Cons: Not as nimble since so large
Newly acquired companies may not be used to such a large global organization
L'Or√©al may not understand fully some of the companies they acquire before they acquire them and this makes transitions/change tough at times.
Advice: Listen, listen, listen
Some of the best ideas can come from frontline employees especially ones who have been working on the frontlines of companies L'Or√©al may have just acquired. It's OK to show interest in what the lower level employees have to say. In fact, it is vital for change and there is a lot of that at any company especially one as global as L'Or√©al.
Pros: Big Company
Lots of opportunity
Very Competitive Wage
Excellent Benefits
Brand Recognition

Cons: Time off is average - every 5 years or so another 5 days are added.
Work life balance can be a struggle (but if you are non-exempt and can get overtime, they make sure you are paid for that)
Advice: None
Pros: It is a great company to grow at - they encourage their employees to push themselves to move to higher roles after about 2 years in a position.
The compensation is very competitive and the company store is a great perk.
Health benefits are great and they match a 401k up to a certain %

Cons: Some very lazy and apathetic employees with no motivation. Quick changes with marketing, lack of database for records and procedures
Advice: Continue to empower the employee and hire good engineers. Let innovation projects drive the company forward because it the competitive field, new products have to make a splash.
Pros: Large international company with diverse products, brands, and technologies, creams, emulsions, hair color, skin care, moisturizes, sun blocks, fragrances, mascara, foundation, nail polish, hair gels. Forward moving company embracing technology, mobile it, and new trends. Very friendly and hard working people.

Cons: Not very embracing of diversity. Not quite Meritocratic - You have to fit a "certain" mold and make it into the "favorites" class or unfortunately you have little to no career growth opportunity.
Advice: Standardize your people/career management system to mitigate the negative impact of unconscious and conscious bias. This will help to make L'Oreal a great place to work for ALL truly talented people.
Pros: Offers great opportunities for career growth with promotions possible even as quickly as 8months in. 
Great products and benefits.

Cons: Marketing has too much influence in the scientific testing process which affects the quality of testing results.  So many meetings that it can be hard to get work done. Not much room for growth as an objective scientist. Measuring parameters that are almost completely subjective, like 'beauty', 'radiance' etc is an impossible task, which leaves no way to objectively determine how good the product is. Plenty of brown nosing.
Advice: Reduce the amount of meetings you hold with your core group.
Pros: Good benefits. Good job security.

Cons: Global IT department in France is only concerned about controlling all IT services and not the quality of service that is provided the employees.  When you run into issues there is no means to resolve directly and you must wait until the Global team wakes up.
Advice: US management needs to take a close look what is happen inside IT
Pros: People below VP Level in IT a nice to work with, pay is okay,  big corporation, location, nice office, good bonus, international partners, travel opportunities. CIO changed recently.

Cons: Equipment is only patched, not properly fixed. Management is only concerned about production, which is hard to do because you run all shift fixing equipment. MTBF is 1.5 mins.  Only want temporary help, they do not want to hire within, know of several people walked out for wanting to be hired within.
Advice: Fix your machines, Treat people with respect, not down them for not being able to keep rate on faulty equipment.
Pros: Usually plenty of hours. Safety is a priority.

Cons: Pay is not competitive.   Team are run lean to the point of gross inefficiency and undue stress to employees.  Work life balance is non-existent without impacting your work or causing workload to shift onto others.  Political to the point of highly irresponsible decision making.   Promotions are arbitrary and based on favoritism and very rarely merit based
Advice: Decrease the politics and stick to basic principles.  Staff the teams effectively and improve profitably on the product instead of cost and head count chopping and putting the burden of your poor decision making on the backs of your hardest working employees
Pros: Benefits aside from direct compensation (health, retirement, misc fringe benefits) are good

Cons: Be prepared to work in a global company with directions coming from local and global management. Only a con if you can not manage it
Advice: keep listening to employees, it helps alot
Pros: It is cool to work with really smart people who share the same passion for making great products. If you have an idea, you can present it to senior management and make it happen. Benefits are good.

Cons: I don't have any cons to share. This is a company that surveys the entire workforce to improve the workplace annually. It is a privilege to work for L'Oreal.
Advice: Keep up the amazing environment and positive culture.  L'Oreal is an amazing place to thrive, where diverse talent works together in a symbiotic, wholesome organic way.
Pros: L'Or√©al is a wonderful company to work for. Allow people to take initiative and make a difference every day. Incredible culture to thrive in.

Cons: Meeting-heavy culture, still very slow to innovate in many areas, too many meetings and preparation for visits for bigwigs coming from France
Advice: Encourage people to have a life more, take time off, celebrate successes, recognize teams publicly, seek diversity, convert consultant workforce to permanent
Pros: Competitive pay and benefits, moderately
Young workforce (for the most part) modern office, looks good on resume, exciting portfolio of brands, many locations around the world,

Cons: Loads of work to be done, since it is a very entrepreneurial environment, it is possible that lines are blurred within different positions
Advice: find better and smarter ways to promote from within, look at the talent that they currently have and their potential, this would keep current employees more satisfied and motivated
Pros: entrepreneurial environment
oriented to the people working in the company
friendly environment
company enables you to create your own path to growth which include international opportunities

Cons: There is a heavy Workload that could affect worklife balance
Some market initiatives such a flexible hours are being currently analized and implemented in some countries, but we are not there yet 100%
Management could be improved
Advice: None
Pros: You are free to create
In this company you can really make things happen
There are tons of ways to grow professionally. The opportunities are there to be taken
L'Oreal cares about their Talents

Cons: Everyone under a VP is basically the same level.  Everyone cranks out mindless decks ALL DAY LONG.  It's bizzare.  Truly.  I mean think decks with over 1,000 slides where only 10-15 slides are actually shown.  Worst company I have ever worked for hands down.  It's mostly former bankers who enjoy the punishment of mindless decks since they get to go home at 10pm as opposed to 3 am.  Just don't.  Skip this one.
Advice: Get a grip.
Pros: None I can thing of or maybe it's the measly free product you get each month.

- Free Goods ($80 worth) every month to spend in the company store

Cons: Constant cost cutting and view of people as resources, replaceable cogs.  This comes down from upper Management which is incredibly hierarchal and represents all the worst elements of french culture..
Advice: You demand a lot.  You pay for little.  You get people to go above and beyond for years.  Then you get a new crop of people when the old ones are burned out.  This is not a healthy strategy
Pros: You can take on a lot roles and responsibilities outside your official job.  Offices are modern and beautiful.  Pay for some employee levels are exceptional.

Cons: Stressful work environment.  There is always a high workload.  Does not matter your level, you will be in the weeds. I find this exciting, but it may not be for everyone
Advice: Keep up the momentum!

Pros: -Gratis!
-Lancome Training was great. Fun, enriching, and informative. The training alone made a part-time worker feel valued.

Cons: Not a con per se, but it is fast-paced (as with all FMCGs).
Also, in such a big company with more than 20 brands, there is still a tendency for some to operate in silo.
Advice: Keep doing what you're doing, as long as the company keeps its vision and its heart for consumers and employees, the results will definitely show
Pros: As someone passionate in the role and the industry, I love that the work is challenging and fulfilling - you will learn new things, drive projects, develop your skills in the ever-changing landscape, and have a chance to make an impact. 

Beyond that, the company is genuine in its desire to constantly provide good environment and care for employees. 
I had heard negative things before joining the company, but after being here for some time, I think that is a thing of the past. 
The management has changed, the culture has evolved, there is a real effort to drive employee engagement, and the benefits such as flexibility to work-from-home sweeten the experience. 
I also greatly appreciate that the company is socially and environmentally conscious.

Cons: - Most reviews on Glassdoor have been forced to be written by the HR. I was asked to write one personally earlier too. 

- Half our campus didn‚Äôt apply because they were turned off by the attitude and sarcastic and mean nature of the HR 

- If you approach the HR for any issue while working there, the blame will be put on you and you‚Äôll be reprimanded

- Interview was filled with sarcastic jibes and personal remarks 

- Small office 

- Very different work timings, work and ‚Äòchill‚Äô atmosphere from what HR claimed on campus
Advice: Be what you claim to be or don‚Äôt claim to be something else. Please don‚Äôt be so rude and sarcastic to students publicly for no reason. Your HR represents your company outside your office, please choose one who doesn‚Äôt ruin your company‚Äôs image. Our entire college has a very low opinion of your company simply because of how the HR behaved with the students. 

Your company is great. Your campus HR is not. And that ruins everything.
Pros: Well the people are pretty like minded. So if you are a certain type of person, you won‚Äôt get a more like minded bunch anywhere else. 

Very open minded people with few restrictions on clothing etc. it‚Äôs very freeing.

Cons: - Malaysia HR managers in long tenure are too political and can sometimes seem unethical in behaviour and remarks. 
- A lot of people agenda needs to be driven by business leaders on their own will poor support from HR. No clear intent on people agenda. Which results in turnover of people. 
- Work scope can overlap at times which creates unnecessary complications. 
- Long hours but it is individual choice due to flexible working style and not forced by company
Advice: - Look into stronger HR leaders as many other markets in region have advanced
- Continue driving transparency in managing situations. 
- Ensure right and proper roll out of new culture project
Pros: - Dynamic business - beauty is ever growing and fuelled by innovation and advancement of digital space - which the company is leveraging well on. 
- Open culture - matrix structure which means individuals don't need to push for visibility. 
- Stable industry and business. Constantly growing ahead of industry pace for the past few years. Lots of potential in Malaysia market. 
- Great Brands and vision - very clear ambition by group and local in terms of business. 
- Great career progression if performance and potential. Inspiring to see peers exported to other markets as well as exposure received. 
- Lots of room to drive and bring changes. Senior management on business side always open to new ideas.

Cons: You are only as good as your last presentation. Your managers and HR are constantly judging you and putting you in categories- Fast track? Poor performer? Be prepared to play politics...hard. If you don‚Äôt want to play the game-get out. Bravo you‚Äôve been promoted to a new division. Not really. Now you have to re-prove yourself all over again. I‚Äôve heard it over and over again - everyone is replaceable. Nope you aren‚Äôt special.  Sorry. Transparency is not king. Everything is hush hush. Rumours are constantly flying.
Advice: For some reason you are able to recruit some pretty amazing people. Treat them that way. You are spending so much energy trying to recruit new talent, what about trying to retain your old talent? No one should be allowed to belittle their employees but I have seen managers do it time and time again. Unfortunately they are still there. Their employees aren‚Äôt. Hmmm??
Pros: The people that work here for the most part (barring HR and top management) are great! You have the opportunity to work on some pretty cool projects. Location of office is amazing and very central.

Cons: - highly demanding with long hours due to lack of process and meeting inefficiency.
- strong culture can be very hard to adopt when coming from other companies. micromanagement from top executives down to the smallest execution details.
- short term and internal decision making process can get in the way of long term gains.
- interpersonal leadership skills dont always determine who gets promoted.
Advice: - take specific, measurable actions behind existing programs to improve work/life balance so that teams see quick wins of it.
- reward managers with team leadership skills: broaden manager's evaluation criteria beyond business results, making teams take an active role in the evaluation of their managers with an impact on their current and future career moves.
Pros: - fast learning curve, very dynamic and changing environment that fosters challenging how things are done (faire et refaire pour mieux faire) with the means and resources to make ideas happen. 
- focus on results, not process.
- young, international teams who are passionate about the beauty industry and forging strong networking relationships with their coworkers. 
fast paced careers with international and very flexible paths.
- increasing focus on social/environmental/ethical impact at all levels of the company, strongly promoted by top management.

Cons: There's a lot of pressure and since it's a very changing, fast paced enviroment not everyone resist the pressure. People can be a little too stressed or too pressure mainly during the seasons.
Advice: Be closer to the people; challenge your teams but give them tools to grow and improve with the company. Listen to them and make people a priority because that's were the results come from.
Pros: It's a company with a great work enviroment, very young, fast paced and creative. All ideas are welcome and you feel truly appreciated and truly listened even when your ideas are not implemented they always listen to you. The Ethics departement is constantly checking everyone is treated farly and respectfully and they are very accesible. The products are great wich adds a lot of fun to the work, sometimes they give frees samples to the employees so you can try them. It a very fast paced company so you are challenged to constantly developing new skills and improving the way you do things.

Cons: - Bullying, cliques of people
- No work-life balance and extreme workload
- No humanity, you are a number and always replaceable 
- They only care about numbers, not about the employees
- Not ethical, even though they claim to be
- HR does not care about you, they listen to the higher ups. 
- You will work weekends all the time and it is never enough. 
- If you divide your salary with the amount of hours, you make less than minimum salary
- Prepare yourself for international VP visits during which you will not sleep for over a month
- Only for extraverts, A type personalities. 
- They want everyone to be the same, they do not focus on strengths.
Advice: The culture of this company needs to change. Treat your employees like humans, not slaves. Care about your people. I was bullied by my own boss for 2 years and HR did nothing so I left. Ended up in a burnout. Trust me, it's NOT worth it.
Pros: - Good on your CV
- Learn to be a slave, so all your future jobs with seem easy 
- Bonus and benefits are good

Cons: Unsustainable work environment that won't survive the shifts in expectations coming from millennials. 

After almost 10 years at the company I feel like I have seen it all at L'Or√©al. Even though I left the company grateful I also left it exhausted. I have experienced being harassed, bullied and awarded all in one day and that is not a unique situation, its expected.
Advice: Hire, promote and train leaders that can do more than manage their operational tasks at hand. Promote the ones who actually lead, develop talent sustainably and empower. You can only rely on the excuse of "the French work style" for so long. What is the real reason your turnover amongst newly hired is so high? 

Develop next generation leaders instead of just marketeers and you will be invincible.
Pros: The most fun I have ever had at a job. Expect to spend your day laughing in the best possible company. Great challenges to overcome and every day is different. 10 years, 3 countries and 5 positions later - this company taught me everything I know about sales, marketing and digital. Best thing? If you have an amazing idea you will always be allowed to develop it.

Cons: You cannot go half way. You have to be strongly involved and work enough to succeed. 
Do not wait for People to tell you what to do. You would be disappoint. Be daring and make proposals. Take risks. 
Be ready to get feedbacks positive & negative & learn from them. 
There is a constant quest for Excellence that means you have to be ready to always learn & train, to do projects, undo them, to redo them better.
Advice: Great New Behaviors Project started in 2016 for even more Team Collaboration, Trust & Empowerment. Keep going !
Pros: The Pleasure to work with Talented & Passionate Colleagues in Diverse Teams .
The Chance to Always Grow thanks to strong investments in trainings like the 5stars Digital Upskilling. 
The Opportunity to have an Impact, to be an intra-preneur and lead change from day one whatever your position or age. 
The Possibility to have a well balanced and fulfilling Family Life and to contribute to a better world through meaningful Projects ( Sustainability & Social ).

Cons: - Work-life balance is a serious issue (great for those who strive for career and put their ambition above everything);
- Company needs to train more their leadership (inexperience): sometimes the intern experience is decided on who your leader is.
- Sometimes the experience can be too intense (importance of tasks vs. workload)
Advice: The Management/Leadership needs to be trained to do a better job at managing their interns/team.
Pros: - Very challenging experience, I wouldn't find an internship with such a great amount of responsabilities and projects anywhere else (in Portugal);
- Engaged employees who "breathe" L'Oreal;
- A company where relationships matter: in a few months I knew the company from one end to the other (around 200 employees in the office);
- The business and sector is very dynamic: Human Resources is highly strategic, instead of administrative.

Cons: Top management level not trustworthy.
Strong culture - if you are not 'loreal-like', you can forget that they will try to embrace you, wherever your experience brings from prior to joining them.
Whether you are a talent or not, is not dependant on your capabilities but rather whether the management likes you.
Office has very high levels of attrition and workload is simply thrown to however is around.
Has 'high hire and fire' situation in singapore office, no work-life balance.
Staff morale is very low.
Advice: In the pursuit of short-term goals, you have lost many talents that has brought loreal to what it is today. 
Hope you can investigate and review what is really happening on the ground and turn the company around, before it becomes a place where beauty professionals shun away from joining.
Good Luck!
Pros: Singapore office has good staff benefits compared to other similar firms in the like industry. 
Internal mobility is fluid internationally - career opportunities are abundant.
Co-workers are nice and friendly, up to middle management levels.
Office is centrally located, near to subway. Amentities are nearby.

Cons: Improvement in integration in role
Credit should be given where credit is due ;)
Advice: Reward the managers who develop their teams and develop individuals (yes its about the numbers but its about people too)
Pros: L`Oreal is a place where you can learn a tremendous amount
You eat what you cook =  you work hard, you will get rewarded
The people are incredible, kind and intelligent and make coming into work a pleasure
The diversity of backgrounds create a inclusive atmosphere
The professional division is a great place to learn, strive and cooperate (my favorite division)

Cons: Super Long working hours and operational messes that you are continuously clearing. It can get very tiring
Advice: The focus is always on the marketing side. Need to focus on other functions and empower them to build a more balanced work place
Pros: It's an open culture with a flat hierarchy. The company is very agile you are allowed to trial New things and even if it fails the Managment supports you and gives you a feedback. There are no fixed processes hence you can bring about any kind of change. If you are an asset and a performer you are exposed to the TOP leadership. Also they tend to load everything to the person who does most the work that to me was an opportunity to learn so much

Cons: There can be a bit of an old school management style in certain pockets, but they're putting huge amounts of effort into changing this
Advice: In the context of change and improvement, don't lose the essence of what makes us L'Or√©al!
Pros: If you want space to move, autonomy, freedom and big learning opportunities then L'Or√©al is the place for you. You genuinely get out what you put in. It's fast-paced and high-energy and you're surrounded by highly intelligent and inspiring people to help you make it happen. Every year at L'Or√©al feels like five years of learning that you'd get elsewhere. The learning & development is world class too, with an array of apps, MOOCs and more to keep you at the cutting edge.

Cons: the benefits take many time to be with you since their hire you. 
The day I stared working with them was august 3th and today still waiting for the gas for my car and the vales for supermarket. Also for the parking lot, my refunds and some other things that I have to use to complete my work in the way they told me that will occur it is not happening.
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of information, friendly website with useful tools and programs. 
They try to help you personal and professional career with courses and programs but they don't teach you how to use them or how to access to them and it is not always easy.
It's a multicultural company so you can see diferent people and work with diferent cultures.

Cons: Concentrated in Hair and Makeup categories. High competition among its own brands with lower margins
Advice: Improve by differentiating and separating innovation paths between brands (L'Oreal / Garnier / Maybelline). Minimize internal competition and avoid hurting financial margins. Define real blockbusters... Bigger, Fewer, Faster, Better (all new product seems to have same priority). Execution at the POS has lot of room for improvement. Increase beauty authority and presence at other personal care categories... e.g. Skin Care (Face & Body Lotions), Deodorants, Shower products, Femenine protection. Employees rotation between countries and brands is too high and fast... These creates no expertise.
Pros: Brand, Beauty authority, Innovation, Advertising

Cons: Change of management thus many changes and affected the morale of employees
Lack of strong middle management leadership
Expected employees to take on a lot of responsibilities which can be a stretch
Advice: Appreciate employees more especially those back-end or contract employees, not just those profit generating divisions
Pros: I have been working in L'Oreal Singapore for 5 years.
Working environment is fun and people are great to work with!
Definitely not a gossipy environment as some claimed.
Career Development is there if you ask for it
Will listen to employees' opinions and improved welfare to enhance work-life balance

Cons: Since there are some many interlocutors and speakers, it sometimes becomes hard to be quick and flexible to launch campaigns to the market. Also, it's a highly competitive environment with lots of business-related pressure, and it becomes quite hard to keep a work/life balance.
Advice: Need to simplify work processes: less meetings, more concese feedback, more analysis of results
Pros: Your managers trust you from the very first moment you start working at the company. You are entitled and responsible for your position and can easily get visibility to top management levels. It's easy to learn from cross-functional teams and, if you perform correctly, you are given the chance to grow in the company.

Cons: - Organic culture. Lack of process makes for a lot of rework and mixed responsabilities.
- HR with weak presence and power. Carreer is too dependant on bosses.
- Work involves strategic thinking and a lot of operational. Lack of processes makes operational load too heavy.
- Empowerement is so strong it is always your fault when something goes wrong.
Advice: - Create clearer business objectives to drive performance and ownership.
- HR should evolve to a less "corporate" style into a people development department.
- Flexibility is good, complete lack of process/system is not.
Pros: - Strong innovation spirit
- Creative culture full of rich exchanges
- Build your own carreer: result driven corporation. People that make the difference will be able to grow. From interns to directors.
- Drive for excellence.

Cons: - lack of processes / very disorganized
- "too many cooks": big ordeal to get anything approved and slow time to market because of constant inputs from various heads with different opinions
- poor communication (employess are often the last to know about big changes happening and are left wondering, since there's no clear strategy/input that's passed on to them)
Advice: - less expats, more locals: most of the time we are left with top management that knows they'll only stay for 3-4 years, so they have no interest in building a solid foundation. They build short-term plans, for short-term results...and not always the best decisions for long-term growth
Pros: - ownership of projects
- ease of implementation of new ideas/processes
- diverse & creative environment
- great people

Cons: Poor HR mamagement, GM sucks, Management team in one of a Luxe brand is gullible, take side, no ethic, no matter you are a potential person but if they don't like you, you will never be appreciated. Gossiping, making rumors, don't act luxury as the brand represents.
Advice: Treat employees fairly. Be a leadership not a boss. Be professional. Protect employees. Learn more ethic.  Somebody in retail management level is unqualified and doesn't know how to manage a team, act like uneducated one.
Pros: Benefit, bonus fixed, profit sharing, public holidays,  fund, location, compensation & benefit could be better but that is alright.

Cons: Manager expects my time and comittment after office hours. Demands the use of Whatsapp on top of emails. Not sensitive and very disruptive to my family and personal life.
Advice: I'm leaving soon, for only one reason - my direct manager.
Pros: Prestigious brand, many free products. Good atmosphere, wonderful colleagues. Company hires good people.

Cons: The grad scheme can seem a little aimless when compared to the internship. This is due to the grad scheme being project based and the internship being operational. So the quality of the scheme depends on the quality of the project given. As is life.
Advice: Perhaps allow graduates to be operational for a while before taking on projects as it can be difficult to take on a project when you do not yet understand the operation.
Pros: There is a great work life balance. The employee demographic is young and energetic. The office is in a great location. The pay is good. Everyone is very friendly.

Cons: - Very little room to progress
- High employee turnover
- Unforgiving French culture
- People were scared to be seen leaving before 6pm
- Interns regularly in tears
- Horrific work/life balance unless you work in demand planning/supply chain
- Bottleneck hierarchy
- Extremely disorganised
- If you don't speak French, don't bother!
Advice: Treat people how you would like to be treated.  There were only a handful of people who I admired for their management style, as the rest either embodied micro-management to the extreme, or none whatsoever
Pros: - Free products
- Huge amount of responsibility
- Most of the workforce are really young
- Canteen was generally good
- Post room staff are the best, so be nice to them!

Cons: The team sizes are small which leads to a bit of more workload per person but at the same time, it gives you opportunities to learn a lot of different things.
Advice: None
Pros: The company is really employee friendly. Working here has helped bring out my creative side in make-up. Management takes care of you in all possible ways. The project I am pursuing in the internship is a real time problem faced by L'Or√©al. My inputs are evaluated and sometimes they are implemented. This shows how much importance they give to summer internship program. By working on this, I can implement various concepts which I studied in MBA in real time.

Cons: Very disorganized and immature people. The entire culture of the company is based on backstabbing others, and all the departments being pitted against each other. 

Expect to work long hours to get the job done because budgets keep getting cut and departments are understaffed, and also because management is constantly changing their mind about everything.
Advice: Get organized! You should be supporting your employees rather than throwing them under the bus to make yourselves look good.
Pros: Nice offices, summer hours, decent pay, great benefits, and discount on products. The cafeteria has decent food too, and there is a daycare on site.

Cons: Pay is not competitive
Depends on luck - sometimes u get bosses that doesnt explain why we do things but just want things to be done.
Advice: Allow more feedback and speak to all tiers of staff not just middle management. 
Change the way of working. 
There are too many level of hierarchies and different interpretations via the managers and the ones executing doesn't relate if they don't meet the right managers
Pros: Face pace 
Given the Flexibility
Able to feedback and voice out
Opportunities not just given to seniors
A lot of fun
A lot of personal development and learning

Cons: Perks did not outweigh the cons: lack of ability to progress into different areas, no encouragement or support from senior members of staff. They seem to only retain employees who are either cut-throat or want to stay in the same position. No reward or attention to those who are improving product sales, work hard and/or show great passion for the brand/company. Office politics makes for a tricky working environment.
Advice: I'm afraid there isn't much point....
Pros: Gained a lot of insider beauty industry experience.

Cons: Not a place for staying in comfort zone or people without entrepreneur spirit
Needs more structure and be more focused on "fewer &better"
There are lots of work-life balance for many people, yet some  lacks it

Dynamic, fast, smart in sensing and acting with entrepreneurship
Focuses so much on sense of purpose and the business itself is about "beauty"
Nice people

Cons: To corporate / hierarchical and to structured. Entrepreneurship is not stimulated enough. Most people are really young within L'Oreal. Company needs more diversity: more older people / more man / more people from a different education background.
Advice: Need more diversity in teams. L'Oreal recruits way to many interns to many  or people from student associations. Recommendation is to look more outside the company.
Pros: L'Oreal invest a lot in people. Especially in education. Also the option to develop yourself in the company or to switch a job internally is definitely an advantage.
Working hours are perfect within L'Oreal.

Cons: A lot of old school marketing people. New ideas in marketing are rare and success of the company is insecure, as not whole management is developing. Too much depending on France and brand thinking.
Advice: Accept change and not live it as phrases. Understand what brand building will be in the future and push for new ideas.
Pros: Entreuprenial thinking, responsibility and Great Marketing. You have the chance to decide and execute own ideas pretty quickly, even if you are new. If you can convince management and they buy in. Great brands and good growth!

Advice: None
Pros: A business that is forever evolving, no 2 days are the same so if you are resilient, passionate and ready to work hard then L'Oreal is a great place. Success is part of the culture, but more so in recent years the how we win is just as important. L'Oreal places allot of value on it's people and you as an employee feel as if you can make a difference.

Cons: When you go to training they say its a ethical company but when you work in the sales. They want numbers anyhow. If you are working according to systems you wont be promoted but if know bootlicking and can do sales by even wrong means.you will b promoted.
Advice: U r carrying a huge brand name atleast take care of that. Sales doesnt mean you can do it unethically. U r loosing talent and market share because of this only.
Pros: Only pro is that you will have good salary and remineration.

Cons: You need to work hard in order to proceed and move further in the organization and understand that a job at L'Or√©al might not be always a 9-5 job. But the efforts you invest are worth it in the end!
Advice: None
Pros: I would recommend L'Or√©al to any of my friends who are not afraid of challenges and want to work with incredible passionate people! L'Or√©al is a great school to learn from the best in the industry while developing yourself further each and every day. There is an individual training plan created for you each year!

Cons: The only one I find is typical for this kind of structures full of "ancient" employees. As the company is huge, the culture very deep, it is a long way to feel well integrated, a lot of infos, behaviors to handle.
Advice: None
Pros: L'OREAL has developped a strong culture, brand and performance. You feel it as soon as you get in. Furthermore, all the company is international oriented. A lot of projects and challenges ; you have the ressources needed to success.

Cons: - Human Resources (not human at all)
- no recognition for the work that is done
- very aggressive culture.. people will do whatever they have to do to get ahead

- a lot of opportunity to grow

Cons: They do not care about your development, never send you for seminar to develop your skill because they are too frightened by loosing you.
Advice: If they would invest in their employees the employees will be thankful and stay in. because they will see the management care so why should they leave?
Pros: Quick environment is perfect for start of your career. You can learn a lot of, you can do a mess up something and no one will punish you because it is international stable company.

Cons: Some old people still reluctant to change. Management style is a bit chaotic, lacking simples processes and project management behavior
Advice: Keep focusing on making L'Oreal a simple organization. Make it more diverse and less French centric, investing more attention in talents from elsewhere that not Paris
Pros: Great infrastructure, lots of brilliant brands and very focused mindset in beauty. It is a company that understands it has to change to adjust to the new times and is doing what is needed for that.

Pros: - Strong team spirit, working with bright people

- Large-scale projects with world-leader cosmetic brands

Cons: Over-rated as a global multi, I've worked for other multi-nationals and L'Oteal attracts and retains a poor talent pool because of the way they treat employees. If you have low self esteem or are a desperate grad, join them. The previous comments of bullying within from management is completely true. The comments re: a "high performance" culture reflects the fact senior people justify their incompetence by pushing those who work in field, on counter, as customer facing or in subservient positions.
Advice: Overpaid ex-pats are a waste/mistake as are overpaid politicians. Australia has a place in the global market so stop treating it with disrespect.
Pros: I will be honest, not kind. Nothing.

Cons: Management can barely say good morning to you if you aren't at their level, HR doesn't care about your development, lack of training, in many positions there is very little work-life balance
Advice: Say hello to everyone including the janitor. Realize all the people going on burnout is because you are giving them way too much. Look like you CARE about your people.
Pros: Great benefits, early Fridays, work from home twice a month, mat leave top-up, discounts on products, working in the downtown core

Cons: Lack of career opportunities (small subsidiary), work-life balance doesn't happen for some people, depending on position. Compensation is average, could be better. The annual raise for young people is low (2-3%) and the work can be overwhelming at times, so many young talents leave after 1-2 years.
Advice: None
Pros: Young, intelligent, passionate people who motivate you every day to bring your best. We all love our products and there are a lot of opportunities to get creative.

Cons: Dependent on role, you can work very long hours and  it's expected   This can play with work life balance. Your choice.
