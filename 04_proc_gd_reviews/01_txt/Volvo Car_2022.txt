The are all fighting over each other to get to the top and that is creating a toxic environment at work. They believe in putting everyone down so they can look good.

Even after telling them, I have chronic kidney stones and other health issues, they stick me in Building B which is the Paint building.

Cons: No career growth at all. They talk a lot about it but no new technologies are brought in as the Management team is non technical. Also, the office politics is horrible. Management has favorites and you need to get on their good side, if not you will end up doing work which others will then take the credit for it. Pay scale is also not up to NYC standards. The directors/sr. managers make 100% salary in bonus while the worker bees make 20%.
Advice: Stop the office politics and hire technical managers, directors. Listen to the staff and make better choices.

Advice: None
Pros: They pay competitively. Good vacation time.

Cons: People who have no experience in the field are heading departments with no vision and making decisions that are harmful for the company. Politics rules in Volvo, you don't need any skills as long as you can butter up your manager. Since the manager themself doesn't have any knowledge, background or experience in the field they'll let you do anything you want with unlimited budget bringing Volvo in a sorry state. If they can revamp their americas management team by getting more technical people who can create right strategies, they can go far. Breaks my heart to see a company with so much potential falling behind due to lack of right talent.
