Cons: The length you are at the company is valued over your level of experience. Their disability program is extremely difficult to navigate. They lowball salaries and extremely underpay contractors, and do not easily negotiate, if at all. It is fairly easy to move positions within roche, but management is frustrating, and there is a clear hierarchy.
Advice: Help your employees more!! Advocate for them!! Step in if you see them struggling! Talk to them and listen to what they say. Don’t be rude or condescending if someone doesn’t know something. Don’t hire or promote people just because they’ve been their for a long time. Don’t tell employees not to discuss salaries or pay, don’t discriminate based on disability and don’t allow other employees to do the same. Step in and correct harmful and sexist behavior, don’t just let people off with a warning. Do better!!!
Pros: Roche has wonderful benefits, and has a lot o offer. They are a global company, constantly evolving and providing ways to improve. Once you are an employee, it is hard to loose your job. Almost everyone I’ve worked with has been pleasant and helpful (with a few notable exceptions)

Cons: So far a lot of travel and it takes a long long time to get anything done at Roche. Tools and software are not necessarily being used as intended which leads to hang ups and lower productivity.
Advice: Do away with long term contracts and move to contract-to-hire. There is amazing talent currently on contracts that we are at risk of losing because they need better benefits than what their agencies provide. Consistently extending contracts instead of allowing people to convert means they walk away because they need FTE benefits and find them elsewhere.
Pros: I’ve been at Roche three or four months now and I’ve never been around such a mature organization. For the most part, everyone treats each other calmly and with respect and there is great collaboration between teams. The offices that I have been to inspire collaboration between teams but also the opportunity to work in ways that work best for you (individual meeting rooms, couches, etc)

Cons: The culture changed, in my opinion, with the new CEO in North America. They used to be focused on customer first and attracting and retaining the best and most talented employees. In my experience they have become more bottom line driven, evidenced by layoffs after a phenomenal growth year. I know many top tier employees that were let go, with no effort by Roche to retain them. These layoffs also left many key customers without ideal support. In other words, what they say and what they do are two different things.
Advice: None
Pros: Roche has great benefits, very high quality products and excellent training programs.

Cons: MICROMANAGED to the point where you have to ask for permission to use the bathroom. If you enjoyed the worst parts of high school then this is the place for you!! You don’t care about your well being at all. They belittle people and make you feel insignificant. Management is a joke, they don’t know what they’re doing or how to talk to people. Worst place I have ever worked for. I suggest you run for the hills because it’s only getting worst.
Advice: Stop micromanaging. When you ask for feedback on how to improve you should learn to actively listen to your employees. When selecting a manager focus on someone that can speak properly to their team, not someone who only bosses them around.
Pros: Everyone said the benefits were great but I don’t think their benefits package justified them treating you like a high schooler.

Cons: Constant changes in all parts of the organization.  The company is too big and heavy - present a challenge from speed and efficiency perspectives.
Advice: PT, PD, GPS, etc. these are all artificial boundaries we implemented. We talk about speed to patients - have you really look at how fast (or not) we could move? Many of us are burnt out during COVID - while you talk about work and life balance, the work doesn’t stop when we take a day off or two.
Pros: Deep science and patient centric.

Cons: Execs wanting to fix what's "not broken", upper management silos in similar divisions in different countries, rare promotions in certain divisions/locations that can affect morale
Advice: Regular re-orgs are not always necessary, keep the Roche collegiate culture alive (it is very uplifting)
Pros: Collegiate atmosphere, competitive salary, great benefits, work life balance, growth opportunities

Cons: Maybe could invest more time into an organized training system for new employees. Pay could be a bit higher compared to competitors.
Advice: None
Pros: Creative people, supportive management, good system in place for mentorship for future preparation for higher level roles.

Cons: - Admittedly, the culture that this company loves to talk up is sometimes cringeworthy.
- Realistically, there is very little chance, particularly with the recent hiring surge followed by a hiring freeze, that you will be able to move up within the organization. This is usually the case with most companies anymore, but for a company that preaches the personal development of its employees, it is hypocritical.
- Management is not connected with the employees within the labs. They make decisions at times that are to the active detriment of such employees. I will say that normally management is fine, but they have made some decisions that have left me scratching my head to an extent.
Advice: Please connect more with the employees that occupy the groups you oversee. Do more to realize what they actually struggle with, and don't make knee-jerk decisions that in reality aren't helping or even actively hurting. Also promote more from within. You spend so much to educate and train these professionals in your labs.
Pros: - This is a great company to cut one's teeth at if you're a recent graduate. If you're able to make it to Direct-hire status the pay and benefits can be extremely favorable.
- Speaking of benefits, one major thing you can use those benefits for is to further your education if you so desire. They have a very generous tuition assistance program.
- Just about everyone here is genuinely friendly, and more than willing to help out your group with something should the need arise.

Cons: The pay could be a lot bette
Advice: None

Cons: constant upper management change always
Advice: None
Pros: great benefits takes care of employees

Cons: Not many cons here, generally good
Advice: None
Pros: Good culture. Good benefits. Overall

Cons: Other companies also have good benefits.   No upward mobility for age 40+.  Being outcompeted for package on pay and benefits.  No leadership mobility for those who are not Swiss or married to Swiss.  The company idea of diversity and inclusion, which is part of their company Video training on D&I, is a room of white men from different countries.    Latest reorganization is unfavorable to Americans but favorable to Swiss citizens, even though American economy is contributing over half to Roche revenue. Claims to be agile, but it is just a word for the company.
Advice: D&I means black, white, Latinos, LGBTQ, and Americans, especially people of color, deserve more respect.  Stop giving privileged treatment to the Swiss and be equitable to Americans, and other countries.  Stop the cyclical removal of older workers in your talent refresh initiatives. Aryan/German leadership are not the only viable pool of leaders in the world.
Pros: Benefits.  Good place if you want to stay at the same job for 20+ years and you have no aspirations for promotions.

Cons: some inertia in translating results to clinic
Advice: None
Pros: lots of interesting projects to choose from

Cons: Not enough time off for family
Advice: None

Cons: Corporate, cookie cutter structure, slow advancement.
Advice: None
Pros: Quality of life is great. Working environment is excellent.

Cons: Closed up operations for good
Advice: None
Pros: Employees were treated fair and good

Cons: I've worked at lots of companies and never seen one that has as many reorganizations. These reorgs seem mostly aimless, though Sr Mgt justifies them as adapting. Mostly Sr Mgt reorgs to justify their own position and embellish their own fiefdoms. There's always employee casualties as there's little effort paid to finding other spots within the company.
Advice: Constant [internal] change creates insecurity, hinders teamwork and wastes time and resources.  Spend less time telling employees they're valued, and more time developing a stable environment that permits employees to more effectively do their job(s).
Pros: Mostly fun work atmosphere. If you're female or a minority, you're golden. If you're an older white male, not so much.

Cons: Toxic, highly politically charged environment, archaic HR.
Advice: Treat your employees as human beings first - that have a life outside of Roche. If an employee suddenly isn't performing as well as they were, it is most likely an issue in their home life. Rather than building a case to dismiss them and put them on a fake PIP for documentation - perhaps try to figure out a way to connect with them on a human level - and support them with personal life - to get the most out of them - and have them go above and beyond for you.
Pros: Good pay, benefits, and stability if you find the right team.

Cons: A LOT of people changes in 2021 which lead to a lot of underprepared transitions and overworked departments (although it’s clear these moves will be beneficial long term) it’s just stressful and messy right now, siloed departments and even regions of the country, highly regulated industry so sometimes change takes a really long time or process improvement is limited, sometimes because the company is so large it’s hard to keep up with company news or people changes in other departments you work with regularly, in the last few years a lot of tenured (30-50 years with Roche) senior management and executives have retired which leaves the typical hiccups that comes with leadership change and the ripple it has through the chain of leadership
Advice: Really make sure you are fully thinking through the impact of change and not only how it impacts the department changing, but other departments who would need time to prepare or put a plan in place (I’m talking to you Sales leader who dissolved PLS into CD). Ultimately, a lot of changes from 2021 makes sense and will long term be beneficial, but it’s really disappointing to see how it was communicated and executed this year. It feels like leadership could have done a lot better planning, and some teams are now dealing with the consequences and it’s hurting moral. I think training refreshers across the company (leadership* & employees) would be beneficial. Specifically on communicating change, change management and planning (through execution - thinking big picture not siloed), and I think our new hires in some of the more technical roles really need better support and proper time to train before going live in their roles.
Pros: Benefits are top tier, large company means so much opportunity and options for career path, you can learn something new almost every day, Roche really puts the customer first and always is trying to improve whether it’s internal processes, constantly developing new technology and testing, how they handled the pandemic (Working from home March 2020-current [August 2021]), open work stations not cubicles, campus buildings look brand new feels like you’re working in the future, such a flexible and understanding company who clearly cares for employees and shows it via the benefits and campus facilities (gym, cafe, wellness center, Starbucks, park, latte coffee makers everywhere), seen growth in culture over last few years - seen a lot of younger faces with fresh eyes and more people of all ages open to process improvement changes or system upgrades

Cons: Difficult company to work for. Career advancement is very difficult to achieve. Business systems such as data, pricing and contracting are a mess with home grown solutions. Work processes are not efficient, lean or employee empowered. Management levels are professional meeting attenders and accomplish very little in terms of tangible results.
Advice: Work culture is a lot worse than many outside the company think with a lot of corporate red tape.  There is a “rising star” and “young professionals” group of employees that get exemptions made for many standards and policies others have to abide by.
Pros: Good health benefits and mission to help patient lives.

Cons: Only applicable for the diagnostics side but the company is really slow when it comes to considering or adopting new technology. Most if not all diagnostic R&amp;D assays utilize PCR as the reporter which makes sense since it is Roche's bread and butter. I feel like this will only limit future growth in the future for the diagnostics division.
Advice: None
Pros: The people here are nice to work with and very supportive they feel like family. Managers work with their employees to achieve career progression. Overall the work is stimulating.

Cons: No strategy to the changes they are suggesting. Chaos everywhere. New restructures all over. Leadership seems to be shooting from the hip and trying to catch up but certainly not leading.
Advice: Link the various things you are changing to a compelling reason why this Is better for employees and customers. But it seems that it’s just a mess they you’re trying to keep up with.
Pros: Work remotely. Lots of focus on culture.

Cons: It's very corporate culture. 
It's easy to move up on hard work and merit, but then it becomes leveraging the network
Managers don't fully understand all areas of business and many lack skills to build sustainable processes and develop people
Advice: Gain more exposure to the different business operations and areas.  Focus more on developing teams and people.
Pros: Great growth and experiential opportunities for growth
Expansive network to build a career domestically or internationally
Great Perks and Benefits

Cons: Changes in the overall operating model of the company are made far too often and not always for the betterment of the employees or customers. i.e. changes that were started two iterations before are typically still in in process while the plans for the next changes are announced. Scrap, restart, wait 18 months and start the process over.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits both tangible and intangible. Culturally, a wonderful place to work.

Cons: Pay discrepancies between people hired to do the same job
The training process is not the best. Trainers are burnt out which results in the new hires feeling thrown to their own devices at times.
Advice: None
Pros: Health benefits
Every month they give all employees a small gift (umbrella, lawn chair, cooler, to name a few) they also are always giving us treats such as cookies and free Starbucks in the cafeteria twice a month.

Cons: Not a fast paced environment
Technology used is not exactly ancient but definitely not cutting edge
Advice: Many people stay at this company a long time and there is a good reason why, but just because someone has been there for a long time doesn't always make them the expert in every area.
Pros: Respects personal life
Promotes education and personal development
Promotes from within
Gives opportunity for those who want it

Cons: Typical corporate, too many layers, various managers causing low morale and negative work environment.
Advice: Very important that managers are trained with people skills and they treat employees well. Need to focus on all levels to make sure all teams and members are engaged which is not the case. Coaching and mentorship is important.

Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits. Solid leadership, expressing a high commitment across the company to the long term software goals. Good work/life balance.

Cons: Customer Service looked down on. Management in Customer Service very inconsistent and lots of favoritism. If you don't kiss up or act like management, you are not a 'team player'.
Advice: Get rid of current manager &amp; supervisors or make them accountable for actually working and caring about their employees.
Pros: Annual profit sharing bonus if company makes their numbers.

Cons: Poor Management, hard to move up especially if you do not have a degree and they get you with low pay by giving close to what you want by offering a differential.

Cons: Long hours, management issues, environment
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits salary pay environment

Cons: With high turn over, resignations and the 10 year continuous global restructuring, you should think twice before joining this company. 
Roche is largely and disproportionately driven by sales, rather than patient outcomes, with marketing department considering all other functions as a support to increase sales but not as strategic partners. 
All this contribute to a bad culture environment and lack of innovation which became obvious during COVID pandemic.
Even during these challenging times, Roche did not offer real support or working flexibility to employees (they may tell you they do but check the details). 
With many people leaving and constant leadership changes they increased pressure and workload on the one staying. 
They may feel they’ve checked the box for diversity with recent LGBT and disability networks but again it’s more for advertising purposes than real inclusion. 
There is no diversity in way of thinking, you won’t feel safe to speak up unless you agree with the majority. 
Finally, HR are known to trick candidats with fake benefits and verbal promesses.
Advice: None
Pros: Learnings and promotions but for very few people
Probably many opened positions given the high turn over and number of resignations
They can offer very good wages but then you will have to sign a confidential agreement as they want to be known as not paying so well and keep most people as low as they can.

Cons: - Getting market competitive pay is tough. They will compare you with other employees, despite the difference in experience. HR seems to have an idea how much people should make starting at Roche and aren’t willing to go higher.
- Getting pay increases is incredibly difficult regardless of your performance.
- No one will consider your career development so you need to come with experience or find a good mentor to help you
- Most if my technical colleagues seem more focused on milestones than the integrity of our work
Advice: Technical departments seem so focused on the tasks at hand they forget to see employee satisfaction as an important factor. It’s one of the reasons the management team isn’t very technically experienced. Consider the employees career development, rewarding talent, and arguing for better pay.
Pros: - relaxed work environment
- focus on work-life balance
- not very technically experienced management, which makes getting ideas across easier

Cons: -Constantly experimenting, a lot of projects abandoned prematurely
-No clear instructions, expected to adapt constantly to vague goals
-Expected to perform with no proper goals
-Transformation took too long, don't see a proper plan to execute it
Advice: A lot of reaching out was done to the lower executives, however, most are just for show and a waste of time. Only a few were genuine in helping. Most just ask you to bear with it. There were a couple of deadweights as well and it took the management too long to remove them. By the time they were removed, so much damage was already done.
Pros: -Great inclusive culture
-Flexible WFH arrangement
-A lot of upskilling opportunities
-Compensated fairly for great work performance

Cons: Has downsides that are not unique to any global organization such as frequent changes that affect employees. However these changes are part of every company these days in order to stay competitive. If you want boring and stability then work for the government.
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible work hours and great work life balance - the ability to work most days from home. Excellent salary comparable to a tech company. Office has amazing benefits such as a fitness center, full cafeteria, great people to work with. Generous paid holiday's provided by the company and good benefits package Management seems to really care about the employees. Above average career opportunities for growth and promotions

Cons: Too much change in the organization
Not appreciated changes in roles - unclear expectations
Too high workload &amp; effort is not appreciated 
No career progression opportunities and perspective. You are stuck with your entry role forever and can only move horizontally
Advice: Give strategic direction and calming perspectives to people at their level (job roles, career progression opportunities) unless they will leave
Pros: Home office
Encouraging environment for new ideas &amp; concepts
great network
great culture
great people!!! Really

Cons: Need to Work upon People and culture, They laid off people who was in organization for 8 to 10 years and Performer also , Personal Biasness is across
Advice: There was a Time when RDC India was known for People and Culture but In 2021 RDC India Played with careers of Person because in the month of May Company ask to leave so many Managers without any reason, and Culprits are still in Organization , Please remove those and Once again it will be a Good Company
Pros: Great Product and Potential, It was a Great company and still have chance to become , Just need some focus on People Management

Cons: The company is slow to take decisions, not bold at all and doesn't like conflicts - particularly when it comes to people. It takes ages for any larger scale change to take place and usually creates frustration and pain, too. Some of the leaders are strangely not suitable for their roles and nobody seems to notice.
Advice: None
Pros: Great purpose, easy to align with it, great products, some fantastic people, some brilliant leaders, friendly atmosphere, human approach

Cons: Continuous change in processes leads to instability and generates anxiety
Although the salaries and benefits are great, there is a lack of transparency when it comes down to how it compares to other companies, unknown salary levels even within the same department.
Advice: None
Pros: The day to day work contributes positively to patients' lives
Roche designs its processes focusing on the impact it has on patients

I have never experienced this kind of people focus before, I always feel treated really well, during my more than 4 years here. I always feel safe and in this current pandemic situation it is proved even more.
The mindset and the behavior of my Colleagues is extraordinary: the kindness, empathy and openness with they turn to others is really inspiring. 
This is something we implement into our everyday as people leaders too.
My own development has been supported from the very first moment, beside the continuous discussions with my line manager, the soft and hardskill trainings provided by the company, I had the chance to join of several projects and initiatives, both within RSS and global ones. As a Team leader, I also strive to create opportunities for my team members to reach the best version of theirselves.
I am really proud to be part of this company and to be able to contribute to Roche's success.

Cons: Bad leadership, toxic place and depends on like and dislike
Advice: None
Pros: Good overall salaries and benefits

Cons: Basic work etiquette is not taught, some bad apples bring bad attitude to work. Middle managers are useless and invent their own jobs. Do not contribute to revenue generating activities. Management receives no professional training and thus has no clue about priorities, conflict resolution techniques or even basic staff resourcing. The ineptitude of management affects projects and instead of learning from their mistakes they entrench and barricade themselves inside their own ignorance. Pay is lower than industry average in CH. Partner companies like Hays are simply robbing Roche employees to the tune of 40% of their salaries and Roche is fine with that. Instead of compensating properly people who create Roche products company prefers to reward useless middle men for doing payroll paperwork. Hays is probably owned by someone related to the board member.
Advice: Let go of people who do not contribute directly to Roche revenues. If you cannot explain what you are doing at Roche , you don't belong at Roche. Stop destroying shareholder value with 100s of  do-nothing office drones.
Pros: Open collaborative culture, friendly and inclusive staff with a few bad apples.

Cons: Career opportunities, office based preference
Advice: None
Pros: Patient focused, great culture, innovation

Cons: - low budget salary
- ancient technologies
Advice: None
Pros: - great culture
- kindness
- employee centered benefits

Cons: Commercial head is biserk and biased with no knowledge on sales and marketing. 
Management is biased and immature set of people who has no knowledge on business
Advice: None
Pros: Research products in oncology. Excellent product pipeline

Cons: POLITICS! 
Leaders feel so entitled! They abuse their power and authority. If they dont like you even if you are a perfomer, they will replace you. They will hire employees they know from their previous companies or from their organizations. The HR &amp; management tolerate such. You cant even feel the presence of HR in the organization! No genuine concern to employees. They dont really care. Leaders (dia) do not really walk the talk. They often violate policies and guidelines.
Advice: Develop internal talents who has heart for the company &amp; for the patients!
Pros: Good company in general (values, mission, vision), good benefits, free lunch, try to promote work-life balance (all depends on the boss)

Cons: One can also end up in a very old-fashioned team, with micro-managers and non-motivated co-workers who would not leave, nor change because of a semi-public servant attitude.
Advice: Consolidate the Diagnostics business by making more brave decisions and taking long-term business risks to strenghen the pipeline. In the Pharma side, clarify the agnosticity of our PHC strategy. Make stronger and faster moves to overcome the competitors: avoid all-comers startegies, leverage the diagnostics expertise to grant unlock faster market penetration. Embed digital solutions and value-based models.
Pros: Attracts tremendous talent. Very innovative, collaborative, creative, enthousiatic teams, if you have the chance to be in one of them.
Opportunities for career growth in the midst of the transformation and restructuring.

Cons: Daily work is awfully separated - some team members are handling 20-30 issues a day and are still underrated, however another can handle 5 and being thankful and even promoted. 
Team is with a very weak knowledge, no opportunity for expand the knowledge and unfriendly to each other. 
Stakeholders and not supportive, but abusive, offensive. 
Info sharing is absolutely missing at all stages. 
Management is not supportive and not able to support the team because of lack of knowledge.
Salary is lower than market's.
Advice: I would recommend to implement feedbacks to be provided for all the parties, involved into Authorization process. 
Also I would recommend to improve info and best practice sharing.
Also I would suggest to review the communication style of CoE Team.
Pros: Great company values. A lot of opened positions.

Cons: As a software developer you will be kicked off the market as their technology is completely unknow for the majority.

Agile is used but many times the way of working is closer to Kanban.

As a company, they reorganize their structure from time to time and promise to be better and so on, but at the end of the day everything stays the same.

Promotion is hard as new positions open very infrequently and many times they're already assigned to someone once they're published.

You end up realising you're trapped in a cage made of gold from which it's difficult to escape.
Advice: Make the organization changes more visible to all employees. 

Promotions should be more frequent.
Pros: It's a great place to work as they offer many benefits and in general colleagues are nice and make you feel comfortable. Good salary, cantine almost for free, flexitime, homeworking, and so on. It's all gold from the inside.

Cons: The disadvantages that Roche has, for me, would be the bias that people have towards the pharmaceutical industry, for which as a company I do not see any problem.
Advice: None
Pros: When referring to the advantages we must denote that the global development that Roche offers year after year is one of the main goals for which it makes it an extraordinary company, as well as the development of new technologies that keep it at the forefront and as a benchmark. from the area, just look at the list of essential drugs that the UN draws up, to be able to denote the great development that the company provides worldwide.

Cons: Constant restructuring and transformation leading to low morale, confusion, and a sense that the senior management care only about themselves and shareholders. Roche should return to the time where it looked after its employees. I fear that the decline in the company’s treatment of employees will weaken its culture, resulting in an exodus of talent to competitors and smaller biotech. The result could be a corresponding decline in financial performance and innovation.
Advice: None
Pros: Highly skilled people, empathetic culture, lots of opportunities, collaborative, great benefits and work-life balance.

Cons: People very set in their ways of working want be be a more agile organisation however don't have the process in place , there lot of clever people however no starter finisher
Advice: Leadership need ensure that there new ways of working is clear defined as a new employee need understand the culture and mindset and behaviours of Roche and the support and guidance is given
Pros: People are very friendly and make feel welcome , Roche as a company is patient centric and do what patient need next.

Cons: Many within the company complain that things move slowly; they move much faster than in some much smaller companies I worked for.
Advice: Keep up the great work.
Pros: The company culture includes:
- Strong empowerment
- Focus on people, especially attracting and retaining outstanding talent
- Focus on creating value – especially for the customer and the patient
- Courage and ambition

Strong culture of empowerment causes several nice effects:
- it attracts smart and engaged people
- it makes room for you to pick up your own extra challenges, if you want to
- it promotes healthy internal competition between departments and projects
- it establishes an attitude focused on creating value, and not making your boss happy

Focus on people includes:
- Extremely attractive working conditions: broad trust and freedom, various perks, you're free to buy whatever tools you feel like you need, within reason.
- Competitive salaries.
- Bonuses actually reflect performance – so if you over-perform, you get significantly more money.
- Lots of trainings.
- Excellent treatment in the rare cases where termination occurs: you're paid for searching a new position for several months.
- Leaders are chosen with strong regard to their leadership &amp; people skills. Most employees respect and speak well about their leaders' actions, regardless of how far above the leader is. This is an extraordinarily rare and good sign.

Focus on creating value includes:
- You do not have many "gate-keepers" –&nbsp;those people who want to be in things because "it's in their area". People only mix themselves in things where they can contribute, and stay out of the way otherwise.
- Projects are ambitious; they set out to address big problems in the HealthCare industry. For example, one of the current ambitions is "twice the access to medicines for half the cost to society".
- Roadmaps are courageous: several projects are radical, with timelines of 8+ years. I was positively surprised a few times by the willingness of leadership to take sharp decisions with short-term impact on revenue because they were "the right thing" going forward.
- Challenging: most leverage the boundaries of state of the art research on chemistry, hardware and software.

All in all, the average employee base is extremely competent, quality-driven, and willing to fight for "what's right".

Additionally, there is a lot of mobility within the company. Many people move around every 2-3 years, and people who strongly over-perform are often promoted quickly, or at least pushed up in salary very quickly.

This is hands-down the best company I ever worked for. Great, engaged people who care to do right by patients and society. I have been 3 years at Roche.

Cons: Questionable job security due to relocation of positions away from US/EU to cheaper locations. No career growth within the department other than line management (i.e. group head) in the best case. No granularity in job titles based on depth of experience and responsibilities; everyone from beginner to advanced is a "manager".
Advice: N/A
Pros: Good salary &amp; benefits, innovative company with many promising projects, wide product portfolio of impactful products, development opportunities available to (some) employees, travel budget better than in some other large pharma companies, some of the group heads truly care of their direct reports.

Cons: Since 2 years we are going from one transformation to another and this has resulted in layoff after layoffs after layoffs. We started in the affiliates, than we moved to HR, Finance, legal, Communications, than to R&amp;D, than to Diagnostics, than to IT and probably we will start again then. Today we don’t say restructuring or reorganization we call it TRANSFORMATION. There has been 1000s and 1000s of job losses in all these transformations. And nobody speaks about it...........How do they keep it quiet???
Advice: Less transformations and more focusing on really Digital health and let’s save also some money on the extravagant Management salaries (as they keep getting higher and higher)
Pros: Moving more towards self organized organizations, more employee empowerment. Salary, and other benefits on site.

Cons: They dont pay extra hours even when you work on saturday, sunday. holidays or after labor hours
Advice: It is a good idea that all the people leaders live the VACC values, breathe the VACC values not olny in a paper.   To take in consideration the years of the collaborators have working in Roche, their experience and knowledge before fired them without a valid reason, such as Transformation D
Pros: The job perks are awesome, and it is rated as a best place to work, you can help people causing a positive impact in their live and health

Cons: Company has been slow to transform, processes take up a lot of time, difficult to find new career opportunities within the company if not interested in relocating to Basel. Seems like most countries are still not fully open to permanent remote work.
Advice: Expedite transformation by hiring more digital talent from outside the industry.
Pros: Friendly culture and experienced colleagues, great benefits (incl. health insurance, extra paid leave for all), remote work has been common (in our country) even before pandemic. Meaningful work in healthcare.

Cons: We have too many reorganizations lately
Advice: It would be great if there was a more logical transition and less mixed messages/actions (e.g. global and local management actions and statements should be more in line)
Pros: Roche is a great innovative company where you can make a difference for our patients. It is also very global and diverse, yet you have certain freedom in actions (in non-gxp related activities). Company provides training and development programs as well as some other benefits.

Cons: In healthcare the product and development life cycles are very long.
As a large company and market leader in many fields it faces naturally the innovators dilemma.
Advice: Focus on what is important and generates value. Look for challenges and solutions inside and outside the company.
Pros: The company is innovative.
The company is a worldwide leader and sells in almost all markets in the world.
The company is very scientific and develops the most modern technologies in the world. 
The company is dynamic and people focused.

Cons: (This is about Roche Diagnostics in Penzberg Germany, I don't experience within Pharma but I heard it is much better) The environment is not international although they claimed to be an international company. People are not incentivized to be creative and make processes faster and more efficient, but just to follow the status quo, no matter how old or outdated they are.
Advice: None
Pros: Relatively good payment and benefits

Cons: - Continuous restructuring/ new ways of working, which stifles short term / day to day progress
- Too long to get work done (still a lot of time spend gaining alignment etc … due to size of organization)
- Salary at the lower end
Advice: Overall doing a great job but need to cut back on organization and operational changes
Pros: - Company culture and people
- work life balance
- pipeline
- career development / experience opportunities
- genuine interest / motivation to serve patients

Cons: relatively low salaries, too much attention to the corpo culture, very low chance to grow
you can find your conner and stay there for years and years, if you say what they want to hear
you need to show that you are very busy, while you may not be busy at all, then you will be recognised
Advice: trust your colleagues, don't be stubborn book of rules readers
Pros: good for start your career when you are fresh right after your Bachelor

Cons: Really hard to move around. Change all the time. Great values, but no buy-in from management to empower individuals.
Advice: Promote internal talent based on actual talent rather than who you know. Have more input on strategy / initiatives &amp; take accountability when things don't go as planned. The company has great values, get on board.
Pros: Good benefits, flexibility, work/life balance. Great people for the most part. Good bonus, raises, base pay.

Cons: Constant transformation / restructuring ongoing impacting the motivation and time to actually do work that has an impact

Big difference between what is said about diversity and the reality
Advice: Land the transformation plane so we can get back to what we do best
Pros: Good salary and overall package (Reka, pension, supplementary accident insurance etc etc...) 
Clear Mission and purpose

Cons: There is nothing to mention.
Advice: Employees need to understand how they can make the biggest contribution to the company's vision. Let them know how their work fits into the larger picture for your organization and for your consumer, client, or other audience.
Pros: I feel like everyone is getting a fair opportunity and I saw exceptional support for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company culture is professional, supportive and caring.

Cons: When you are one department is difficult to be a part of different one without networking (more important then your impact or achievements). A lot of politics inside a company. A lot of CET time zone projects for someone who is based in APAC (evening calls)
Advice: None
Pros: International team with deep experience. A lot of mentoring programs which helps to grow, good benefits and salary. Stability.

Cons: - Too many reorganization (Roche Diagnostics International)
- More German than International (Roche Diagnostics International)
Advice: None
Pros: - Patient care orientation: "doing now what patients need next" is more than a tag line/slogan is a real purpose
- Innovation: strive to innovation, investment in R&amp;D above the segment average % on sales 
- People focus: interesting benefit packages, good work life balance, speak up culture

Cons: Bad work culture and staff mental health ignored
Advice: I have tried in the past year to resolve this through legal recourse with no positive result.

Entity I'm refering to is not Dia or Pharma.

The incidents mentioned herein has caused me tremendous stress and trauma. 

It's very bad for staff mental health.

Diplomacy to resolve issues whilst Im employed yields no positive outcome. 

As per some comments on glassdoor herein, diligence, clear understanding of work process and SOP are not really appreciated.

It's whom we play up to that matters.

In this particular entity, an admin asst who only came onboard on April '19 can play all kinds of politics with EA whom she report to.

It's totally bizzare why management felt such behaviour is acceptable.

The creme de la creme is 17th July '19.

What admin asst did on this day?

Attachments from my lawyer to whom it's being send, should know.

All I want to say here is 3 colleagues advised her that not possible to issue cheque by 4pm that day as vendor is not in SAP.

It's not her JD and it's wrong procurement process.

She has been clearly advised to approached me as it's my JD. 

The worst these colleagues are attending training on that day.

She just stubbornly refused and later that day lash  out at me over a trivial incident.

It's clearly verbal abuse and an assault on my character.

At meeting to resolve issues, Head of APAC Finance, HRBP, EA who is also LM to admin, totally brushed all facts aside.

Her excuses are all accepted.

Did they question her on her stubborness not to understand work process over insistence to issue cheque. No.

Did they reprimand her over verbal abuse and to apologised to me as what I requested. No. 

Instead I witness a charade of my LM (Head of Finance APAC) asking HRBP to look into our jobscope.

Honest, if my LM n HRBP have  no clarity of our jobscope then this is really bad management. 

I have assured before admin asst came onboard there is no overlap of job scope.

Moreover email from EA on admin asst onboarding clearly states her job scope - again no overlap.

The only thing I understand is HODs' whom I support at that time will be transfered to admin asst portfolio.

Site security, procurement etc is clearly not admin asst's JD.

All I want is an apology from admin asst which is clearly something management don't feel Im being owed an apology.

Do you blame me for politely ending such unproductive meeting and walking out?

Yet, HRBP n LM kept insisting matter resolved.

There are many incidents which I have clearly highlighted which are bad work ethics and practise.

Well questions to Basel HQ,.

Is it correct that new staff be encouraged to ignore correct work process?

Is it correct that new staff be indirectly encouraged to be disrespecful to fellow colleague  and lash out as n when they feel they are entitled to.

N refused to apologised under weak excuse which management accept.

Is it correct that management encouraged bad work ethics?

I have witnessed many bad altitudes here in this office.

The above is not an isolated incident and I have diplomatically brought this up to my LM.

EA whom Admin asst is reporting to has always been politics stirring.

She has on many occassion even sent me an invite when she take leave cc to our then IT manager n admin asst.

Note - I do not report to IT manager or EA.

Really?. If this is not creating an unhealthy work environment? 

This is not staff mental health being stressed to the max?

All kept quiet and accept EA's bossy ways as management have indirectly encouraged such bad behaviour.

Honest EA accessing an admin asst's KPI as LM. 
The way I look at the situation, it's encouraging unhealthy work environment n politics.

HRPB is no better, my Payasia account was deleted but no apology or explanation given.

Im told my job is redundant however I realised this is not true after I left.

No job should be declared redudant when almost 90% n more of jobscope, is shuffled amongst staff who should not be taking over administrative, local procurement etc.

All I want is an apology from admin asst and to highlight all the bad management practise.

All I want to say in summary - To do the right thing as management

Roche is overrall a reputable Company. 

It's just that this entity don't seem to embrace the correct Roche culture
Pros: All sorts of GOES survey n feedback channel which is not effective

Cons: Roche UK and Ireland is a company that speaks about their values of honesty and integrity without actually exhibiting them at all. I found them to be dishonest and in no way care about the patients we provide services toward.
The company is only focused on maximizing profit at all cost.
They advertise salaries as being market leading, but they pay between 80 - 120 % of the median market salary.
I was one of the most experienced consultants on the team when I left and after 7 years of year on year pay increases I was on scale at 81%. It turns out I was payed significantly lower than everyone else on the team.When taking the job after a restructuring I was told that, based on our experience, we would all be on the same salary scale and bonus structures. However after speaking with some of my team mates I found out that this was not the case. When I raised the issue, I was repeatedly lied to about my salary in relation to the team until I showed them the payslips two of my colleagues shared with me.
Their HR policies only catered for their UK based staff and even at that the focus was primarily geared towards their office based employees. The driver training the provided only catered for UK roads and they provided none for the ROI. Another example was they mandated Hep B immunity level to be retested every 5 years, but in Ireland (and the majority of the world) guidance was updated to say once achieved immunity is life long. As a result it's not possible to get retested 9nce immunity is proven. I said this to management/HR and that my GP would not test me. Their response was to find another GP and lie about my medical history to get the test done. 
I joined the D&amp;I team in order to help correct these issues and was advised by senior management (including a director of Ireland) to stop doing so.
Career progression is primarily based on you're liked by senior management and not on your ability to perform at your role or your skillet. Also you are significantly hampered if you have a field based role.
The work-life balance was also very poor with regular long hours expected, in particular around responding to tenders.
Advice: Practice the values you preach. Be more honest. Have more integrity. Put the customer ahead of the drive to maximize profits, you can still make a profit while delivering a good service for patients. Start promoting people into management roles who are capable of managing people.
Pros: If you are based on the office, they have an on-site gym and subsidized canteen

Cons: compensation is lower than on market, archair development path (only 3 choices), letting go / firing process at the office in Roche Polska is tremendously bad-humiliating, inhumane. Worth the case for Labour Justice department to see it through. Sadly.
Advice: Stop self-marketing yourself, start really appreciating experienced (even more than you are) people.
Pros: Package, atmosphere, office, benefits, training.

Cons: Depending on the department sometimes there might not be enough resource, or the need between department to fight for resource. Also, it might be a bit difficult trying to move between department

Cons: Sometimes career advancement can be slow or depending on your luck as there are frequent restructures.

Good compensation and benefits especially if coming from external
Good company performance and family culture way back

Advice: None

good work and life balance 

many of benfit

Cons: It seems that the more that emphasis is put on transformation, the more internally focused we become. It feels some days as if transformation is our business rather than "doing now what patients need next". I hope things balance out a bit.
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, progressive practices, working for a purpose-driven organization

Cons: Slow in career growth 
Average salary comparing with other competitors 
Political's between employees due to different nationalities (saudi office)

Pros: Good products
Good policy
Give all the needed technical information and trainings

Advice: None
Pros: it is a company with a great atmosphere and variety of projects or scientific disciplines. Basel is a great place to live.

Advice: None
