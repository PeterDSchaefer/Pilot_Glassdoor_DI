Cons: - RSU’s used in lieu of raises/bonuses with a 3 year vesting period
- no cost of living adjustments and bad raises. For example, one year I won an award for top performance and only got a 2% raise.

- They’re trying to get advisors who have always worked from home into the office
- No options for advancement besides management. They even paid thousands of dollars for my education but provided no opportunities to use my degree. 
- Arbitrary quotas for performance reviews. Eg. At least X number of employees have to receive “needs improvement” ratings, regardless of actual performance.

- Apple doesn’t care about customers abusing advisors. You’ll be treated horribly and then blamed for it.
- They’ll pay you extra for working on holidays, but good luck actually getting a holiday off work.
Advice: Acknowledge there reality that by not providing cost of living adjustments you are giving people pay cuts. I effectively made less the day I quit than when I started, despite winning ACEA 3 times. 

Make it policy for advisors to disconnect on abusive customers. 

Stop making work on holidays/Christmas mandatory. One year I HAD to work on Christmas and took 1 call in 8 hours. Just close down for the day. Call volume doesn’t justify keeping employees from their families.
Pros: Great fringe benefits:
- Health insurance deductible was $300
- App subscriptions (10% happier, fitness +, etc)
- Stock options (85% of purchase price) plus random stock grants.

-WFH
- job is actually pretty easy

Cons: Its apparent that Apple feels very differently about their corporate employees vs their retail employees. The stigma for people who work in retail is present and strong, despite Apple's efforts to convince us otherwise, and despite our qualifications. 

Many of my former coworkers who was not afraid of making the jump, end up leaving for MUCH better jobs with much better pay, and with employers who value them more than Apple did. But those who were complacent will pay the price (and also make those around them pay as well) for confining themselves to a job that Apple does not intend for anyone to keep long term (unless you are in retirement and just want to work there for the stock benefits)
Advice: The only way to shift is for Apple themselves to change their perception of their retail workers. Until Apple considers retail employees just as important and worthy as their corporate employees (and truly consider them, not just by word but by deed, through benefits, opportunities, and compensation), these issues will be permanent
Pros: I was able to meet some very great coworkers, and it did provide some useful benefits such as stock options 

If you are a retired professional, and just want a job that is low-impact, this is a great job for you. Getting the stock benefits as a retail employee is great if you are not looking for anything long term

Cons: Poor management very bureaucratic they would rather see you take a week off and get it covered by a leave of absence than take 2 days off with a simple dr note. This makes no sense and causes lots of issues. Very clicky if u are not one of “them” and you don’t drink the cool air and agree with all their views you become an outcast. If you are overweight or have a disability they don’t treat you well. No one seems to have the answers. You can ask a manager and they will tell you to call HR and HR will tell you to ask your manager. It leaves you stressed out because you can never get an answer. You have to just guess and do your best and hope you do not get fired. This is very stressful. Lastly it is very boring as every role does the same thing all day everyday. They don’t mix things up u come in and do the same thing and deal with the same people everyday. It makes coming to work boring.
Advice: Hire managers based on experience and talent not people you like or think for the Apple mold. And instead hire people based on past experience and performance.
Pros: Good pay. Great benefits some upward mobility
