Cons: Some people are frustrated with the small scope of what they work on or the slow pace but I think that's just a symptom of the size and complexity of the projects you work on at Microsoft
Advice: None
Pros: You get what you put in. If you want a good work life balance you can do that and be successful or if you want to put in a lot of extra hours you'll be recognized. Great pay and benefits.  Inclusive culture.  Easy to move around to other teams if you want to. My friends who were hired with me and didn't click with their first teams have mostly found new teams that they enjoy better.
