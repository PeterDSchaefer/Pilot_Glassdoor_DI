Cons: Lacking empathy - no desire to improve employee experience and no desire to create an inclusive, engaging work environment

Rigid - no desire to test new things, ways of working, or accommodate individuals; not prepared for shifting needs, priorities with regard to individuals or the work

Complacent and cheap - mediocre is good enough; no value seen in excellence or disruptive solutions; constant cutting corners; even junior employees are weighing finances against outcomes and it shuts down even profitable ideas and innovation

Antiquated and unwilling to innovate - status quo is so bad that the innovation here is 10 years too late but celebrated as if it were best in class

Fragmented and inefficient - one hand doesn’t know what the other is doing, multiple groups doing the exact same work for years without knowing it
Advice: Streamline groups for efficiency and to unlock the capital to do better work; don’t put internal groups against one another; communicate a shared vision and disseminate it; if middle managers don’t adhere to vision, provide other avenues; incentivize the behaviors and outcomes you want, not the behaviors of the past
Pros: Some leaders are dynamic and people you’d love working with, and they see the problems; but they’re the exception. It can seem when talking to them a great company, but it soon unravels the more you work across the organization.

Some goals are top down but employers are not confident to reach them

Pros: Mobility to work from anywhere is something already established in the company.

Cons: As I said in 'pros', above: the bureaucracy of the large company is a negative.  Hard to get away from that.  There are also some jerks at high levels.  Again, a symptom of the corporate environment.
Advice: Weed out the narcissists from among your ranks.  It doesn't matter how smart they are.  Ultimately they'll be toxic.  The employees will be happier and more productive without them.
Pros: You have to put up with all the large company BS: politics, big egos in management, bureaucratic processes that slow everything down, etc.  But, all said, the company takes good care of employees, work-life balance is great, and safety is hammered into everyone - whether they like it or not.

Cons: There’s always someone that is a negative person and/or that one person that management protects for some unknown reason. It’s frustrating, but I can work around that person and still love what I do.
Advice: None
Pros: The people I work with make my job fun and challenging. The teams I have been on make an effort to really discuss D&amp;I and we have had many meaningful engagements this year and more planned for the future.

Cons: It’s hard to get a raise, some of the customers treat you like crap and you can’t do anything about it so it starts to wear on you, the company chooses favorites, if you print lottery wrong and the customer doesn’t want it you come out of pocket for it, all the employees complain about the other
