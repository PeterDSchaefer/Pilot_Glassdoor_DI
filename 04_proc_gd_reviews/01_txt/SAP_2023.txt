Cons: Weak sales culture. A lot of back stabbing people who can’t be trusted. There are a lot of older men who need to retire from SAP sales. There are a lot of employees who are sick or die, from either cancer or stress leave. Lots of drama. Unprofessional behavior from sales leadership. The systems are extremely difficult to work with, mostly excel. Contracts and Deal Desk are outsourced to South America and Europe, which causes unnecessary stress and long hours for the US sales team. Check the Bloomberg articles about two Sales women at SAP reported being raped. And Senior woman were bullied out of their roles.
Advice: Since Bill McDermott left the company has been on a downward spiral. North America is Germany’s puppet. The operating model doesn’t work in the ERP competitive landscape; Oracle and Workday being American companies. Replace your systems for sales and marketing. You’re losing millions by having no central system to capture customer data. Too many men in senior leadership positions. Sales and Customer Success leadership are majority white men and lots of family members. Major nepotism at SAP! Stop bullying certain employees and giving sales AE women and minority men the roles and territories that the SAP white men don’t want. Learn how to effectively sell new business, majority of the sales are from existing customers. Everyone is so busy chasing churn and onpremise to cloud deals, the GTM strategy is not taken seriously.
Pros: A lot of good people Lots of product to sell Benefits are top notch Good cultures in pockets of company

Cons: - horrible management in almost all departments --&gt; too many people being managers without proper qualification but based on tenure or nepotism - no innovation power or corporate vision - very "German" as the exec board consists of a few buddies playing soccer in the same hobby team - Hasso has become a burden vs an asset (which he was for so many years) - Ageism galore - questionable view on D&amp;I - non-existing HR function (they are pure administrators) - most boring stock there is (attracting dividend shareholders, thus company does not take ANY risk or drives innovation) - poor compensation if you're not hired in the last 2 years
Advice: - management has lost the regular employee or mid-management - too political to drive innovation and growth - nepotism kills motivation, do some sentiment analysis and you'll see that 90% of employees are coasting and have mentally quit
Pros: - huge product portfolio with a lot of good tools - huge organization with ample opportunity to shift roles - usually very social employer (exception lay-offs in Feb 2023 which was super poorly managed) - ok brand

Cons: - Dishonest, greedy, and untrustworthy company leadership. They blatantly lie to us about not having layoffs. - Over-engineered, low quality proprietary technologies - No QA staff at all (they were laid off years ago) = low quality products, high pressure customer reports. Culture doesn't properly account for testing. - Commitment to user experience was non-existent until recently, and there is a very, very long way to go to catch up with competition - RTO means 3 days in the office unless you have executive approval - Career progression is based on tenure instead of merit. Your hard work may be rewarded by RSUs and a pay increase if you're lucky and a high performer. But actual promotions are based on a schedule. If you're good at your job, be prepared to be placed in a role that you aren't properly compensated for.
Advice: Why bother with advice? It's obvious where the company places its values. SAP is adopting the standard corporate adversarial stance towards its employees. It used to be different. It's the same as any other no-name corp now.
Pros: - Most managers try to respect your work-life balance. - Schedule is very flexible - Lots of interesting technical problems to solve. - Respectful and inclusive work culture - Global workforce means you'll work with people on every continent - Strong benefit package compared to employers in my region

Cons: Full of old technology, old business processes, and long tenure employees who are stuck in their ways. They play politics and do everything they can to push out people who bring in new ideas and business practices that could shake up the status quo. Cares ZERO about diversity. Diversity officers don't have any power or direct reports.
Advice: The company will never succeed if you aren't able to retain and support people who actually want to help the company evolve into something modern. 
Pros: Good benefits and healthcare options.

Cons: telling people they're family to get them to buy into a skewed work/life balance is at best misleading. very focused on employees in "low cost" countries, as opposed to the best talent for the job too many re-organizations (3-4 managers a year is common for many) negotiate your salary as high as possible going in, you may never get more than a cost of living raise ever again ("sorry it's just not in the budget this year"... every year) accomplishment is very driven by adjusting to manager personalities and not necessarily your work (although there are good managers there)
Advice: Truly be an advocate for your employee - learn to manage up when leadership is asking you to do things that are incongruous with being a good manager. Senior leaders: while reorganizations are inevitable, and they occur more frequently now as the pace of change in the world accelerates, be conscious of the stresses this puts on individuals as they have to navigate new leaders, new teams, new work. Change isn't easy, change management is usually nonexistent at SAP down at the "worker bee" level... and that needs to change, itself.
Pros: great benefits my leadership was overall very good

Cons: There are several people doing similar roles or job functions as you since management use them to speed up, weed out and cross-train employees for current and future projects including consulting work with outside clients.
Advice: Less intra-staff competition and more focus on developing individual talents to meet company and employee's goals.
Pros: A good company that supports its employees with extensive training and learning options, sufficient input from management about structured job responsibilities for various projects.

Cons: Management executives sometimes difficult to work with, strange and narcissistic, uninformed and hiding it - so that is dishonest, critical, selfish rather than loyal to SAP’s long-term success.
Advice: Hire from within, those who are honest, hard-working, normal in social behavior, care for employees and company, know how to do the regular work. No narcissists.
Pros: Great peers, salary, benefits working here.

Cons: Was re-orged multiple times as company made significant directional changes. Still feels like there are too many siloes and many job functions where people stay narrowly in their lanes.
Advice: Innovation and 'telling it like it is' feels foreign. Leadership decisions at all levels feel like cautious baby steps, with limited opportunity for entrepreneurial employees to shine outside of fringe/niche roles.
Pros: Good Benefits; Relatively few layoffs during my time which overlapped with big changes and a global pandemic; Comfortable place to work if you are looking for a long-term home; Most people are nice to work with.

Cons: Infighting everywhere. Licensing actively undercuts services, lots of fingerpointing, little to no support, Offshore difficult to work with Virtual no growth opportunity for anyone thats not a millenial. Limited salary growth beyond variable pay. Too many insiders with no knowledge of what good looks like, all competing against each other. It will take you weeks to get anything out of offshore, delivery, estimation, accounting, legal, and other management. By the time you respond to a customer, you're late and your price is 50% over what you expected. Then you will run into the fact that they have cut budgets everywhere, so there are constant resource shortages, cut budgets on promised delivery. 99 different job titles, most of which are back office or some type of fluffy do-nothing roles and metrics collection. Archaic processes
Advice: You had best start talking to people who do the work, because you are out of touch with the reality of what I going on. Just fix processes and get some folks that know how to manage a team over the long run.
Pros: Can get close to the product, decent training.

Cons: Bureaucracy and slow decision-making. High workload and tight deadlines. Involvement with legacy systems. Limited autonomy in technical decisions. Limited remote work options. Potentially overwhelming training resources. Competitive work environment.
Advice: None
Pros: From the moment I stepped into the role, I was met with a supportive and collaborative environment. The team members at SAP are not only highly skilled professionals but also genuinely friendly and encouraging. I felt welcomed and appreciated from day one, which greatly enhanced my motivation to perform at my best. As a Front-End Developer, I had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects that challenged my abilities and expanded my knowledge. SAP fosters a culture of innovation and creativity, allowing developers like me to explore new technologies and solutions. The company's commitment to staying at the forefront of cutting-edge technology sets it apart from other companies in the industry.

Cons: Chaotic, disorganized culture, lack of direction within teams. You'll do the job for at least a year or two before you actually get the promotion. Heavy reliance on early talent to fill gaps puts strain on teams. Lack of transparency from senior management. The recent restructuring showed a major lack of strategy with many high performers let go and low performers kept putting major strains on teams and thereby PEOPLE. Tough work-life balance as the environment is unstable.
Advice: Lean into managers and seniors on teams when planning a restructuring to avoid leaving teams in shambles with select high performers left to keep fort with low performers staying on but not pulling any weight. Get transparent - none of the tough questions were directly answered, rather run around with foggy responses. Create a space for true, open, honest feedback from your employees, especially during the most difficult times. Stop tooting the benefits plan in compensation conversations, all large orgs and most small now offer benefits packages, this is standard industry practice. Make it right: Seek to bring back the major talent that was given away and eliminate the burden of low performers.
Pros: Good benefits, lots of opportunities to learn on the fly, self-teach, and grow professionally as a result. Great opportunity to grow and learn if you are a student as there are lots of internships - be prepared to work!

Cons: At times it becomes difficulat to work with multiple teams
Advice: None
Pros: Good Work life balance in SAP

Cons: Department relatively affected by recession and layoffs, currently in a state of regrouping.
Advice: None
Pros: Great balance between work and personal life, as health is prioritized and time off is promoted

Cons: Everything moves too slow to keep up with competition
Advice: None
Pros: Stable company and good products

Cons: - Inevitably, with every big company, there is going to be politics. - Yearly compensation review - Salary raises - most of the bump goes into bonus and not base, which is a bummer. - Not a whole lot of benefits, pretty bad to be honest, given that we are a tech company located in Palo Alto...
Advice: Wish compensation reviews happen at least twice a year to allow for better mobility, and less stagnation in a T-level. As for salary bumps, would be more motivating if you place most of the bump into the base and not the bonus. More PTO days to match what is available in Germany would be great, 2 weeks is very little in comparison to other tech companies in the Bay Area.
Pros: - Really eye-opening internship program - they allowed me to actually do valuable work that's going to used, not just some random summer project. - Since it is a huge company, there are a lot of opportunities for students/interns. - Great working culture -- flexible work locations. - Work-Life balance is good!

Cons: A micro management environment which stems from the top down. This is not all of SAP but more so in the mid market. Less empowered to think for yourself as they’ve started hiring folks with less experience as they are more likely to follow the straight line approach without question. The role has really moved to an inside beginners sales role. Leaders will strong arm their way into your deals rather than train you to be a better rep.
Advice: Before making a decision to change the corporate strategy make sure the entire company is aligned. The company offers incentives to sell a specific product line but leaders will tell you not to sell it because there’s bad CSAT’s / tons of failed implementations on it. The “give a man a fish for a day and he eats once, teach a man to fish he eats for a lifetime” really needs to be taught to leadership in the mid market starting from the top down. Get rid of the military environment this is a tech company not the army.
Pros: SAP is one of the biggest/greatest names in technology. You will work with some of the brightest people you’ve ever met who are really good at their job. Unlimited resources and the ability to make a lot of money. Industry leader in a lot of products.

Cons: boring projects, not very innovative, slow development
Advice: None
Pros: nice colleagues, free food, global company, work from home

Cons: Company has limited hiring opportunities

Pros: Great company, Supportive and talented team, great benefits, flexibility

Cons: It's a big company so there's always a bit of procedural slow motion, but that's to be expected.
Advice: Keep doing what you're doing!
Pros: Never a dull moment, challenging work, and plenty to do and learn.

Cons: Started to become too social justice focused instead of just making the world run better such that lives of all people improve.
Advice: Stop with excessive focus on DEI and get back to just treating all with respect and helping them improve their business.
Pros: Globally impactful company with great people, pay and benefits

Cons: Honestly, there are none for me.
Advice: None
Pros: collaborative and supportive environment
good salary and bonus, 6% 401k match. 
you get to work with people from across the globe
work life balance
internal promotion

Cons: You can get stuck in a portion of the organization with limited raises, however applying to other parts of the organization allows you to get larger internal increases
Advice: None
Pros: The flexibility is what I love best, my team trusts me to do what I need to do to get done and gives me the freedom to do it as I see fit.

Cons: Lower than average pay, confusing/ineffective product strategy, tension between countries and business units, getting stuck in career dead-ends
Advice: Less secretive planning and ninja corporate pivots, decide whether you want to be a tech company or a consulting company
Pros: Relatively good benefits, commitment to diversity, generally positive co-workers, training/upskilling opportunities

Cons: Bad pay, not all managers are very empathetic and not really care about one's feelings. Frequent changes in the leadership creates some bad image.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company to work for. You will learn a lot and gain a wealth of knowledge, as there are many SAP veterans who have spent 2-3 decades working with SAP, and they always have a lot to talk about.

Cons: Big company, sometimes tricky to navigate.
Advice: None
Pros: You could build a career around SAP whether technical or non-technical, either working for SAP or within its huge partner ecosystem.

Cons: 1. Slow and bureaucratic 
2. Lacks a competitive atmosphere
Advice: None
Pros: 1. Great work life balance

Advice: Doing wonderful job and come up with more innovative ideas.
Pros: Wonderful people and excellent learning platforms.

Cons: No problem or complaint as lot get resolved fast
Advice: None
Pros: Love working for SAP, I have no regrets

Cons: Sometimes shareholders sway the company to make decisions that are poor for employee life. SAP is so big that things can sometimes get caught up in the massive environment that is SAP products
Advice: None
Pros: I loved working here while I could - great pay, flexible work conditions, and nice people.

Cons: Not many, sometimes things feel a bit disorganized but management constantly tries to address and improve
Advice: None
Pros: - Get to work with amazing engineers
- Great WLB
- Challenging issues

Cons: Convoluted business processes requiring too much time dealing with manually entering data in systems and back office approvals. One manager told a license sales colleague to spend 1 to 2 hrs a day updating Harmony (sales data), which takes away far too much time that would be better spent on sales strategy and customer interactions. Management invites feedback, but it does not result in meaningful changes. Upper management, outside of your direct manager, rarely interacts or tries to build a relationship with his/her sales team (some live on opposite coasts) and we have little idea of what they do to bring value to the organization.
Advice: None
Pros: People are collaborative, supportive, smart, fun to work with. SaP provides a generally positive work environment.

Cons: reconstruction sometimes , management might be displaying favoritism in their small group of people.
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits , and friendly co-workers

Cons: German company on an american market, but overall ability to innovate is great.
Advice: No Advice.
Pros: People-oriented, result-driven, careful, ability to make money and transform companies.

Cons: The company is often difficult to navigate.
Advice: Keep up the good work!
Pros: SAP continues as a market leader in the ERP space and has made great strides as an organization and developer of products to emerge as a cloud leader.

Cons: The technology is old and the company is transitioning into a true cloud company. Depending on your line of business it can be hard to hit your quota.
Advice: I would recommend stepping up your marketing and in bound demand generation Strategies.
Pros: Public company, which pays solid salaries and has many lines of business. A bit political but it’s possible to be promoted.

Cons: Work life balance is difficult at times. You’re always on call.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company with fantastic opportunities for advancement into leadership roles.

Cons: Leadership direction over the past several years has been poor. No clear direction or strategy. Products and integration across the suite seem to lack quality compared to competitors. Recent round of layoffs was not as "targeted" as they claim and was instead focused on cost cutting without recognizing the value added by some colleagues who were laid off. Teams are also now left with too few resources to accomplish essential tasks which will put increased strain and stress on those who remain.
Advice: Have a clear product strategy and invest in appropriate development to fully integrate the suite of products offered and make them best-in-class. Communicate clearly with actionable direction.
Pros: Very flexible work environment with remote and hybrid work opportunities. Compensation is on the lower end for the industry as a whole but better than similar roles outside the tech industry (depending on the individual role and company).

Cons: Certain regional cultures can be very clique-y and very boys club mentality.
Advice: None
Pros: Competitive pay Opportunities Early career development

Cons: Changes every year can be frustrating
Advice: None
Pros: Everything is good for the most part

Cons: not much advancement in career
Advice: lead with more passion and vision
Pros: fun place to be at for me

Cons: Marketing leadership and CMO (absolutely the worst!!!). Lack of diversity in marketing. DEI initiatives are primarily benefiting white/ Caucasian women. Women of color are disregarded for internal promotions. White men laid off to make way for white women with no experience . Men of color stand zero chance! LGBTQ has zero representation in marketing. Employee survey feedback is never acted upon. CMO from Microsoft prefer hiring from Microsoft ( laid off Microsoft employees should consider a career transition to SAP, courtesy Julia White) Julia’s contract renewal with SAP spells further doom for SAP (What is wrong is wrong with Hasso and the other founders?)
Advice: Send Julia packing back to Microsoft. Replace her leadership team within SAP Marketing
Pros: Work-life balance is good I have a good manager! Generally speaking the company’s executive management and board is also good (except for a few bad apples) Remote/hybrid flexibility Decent bonuses Liberal vacation policy

Cons: You’re going to make less than compared to google and Apple or Microsoft. It’s just a fact
Advice: Decide if they want their selling point to be culture or competitive pay. Trying to do both now and failing at both
Pros: Awesome coworkers Decent work life balance Good balance of pressure and coolness without cut throat or anxiety inducing

Cons: Slow career growth, team dependent politics,
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits: free lunch, stock options, work-life balance

Cons: Strict management 
Low salary
High targets
Advice: None
Pros: Helpful team
Good office
Good benefits

Cons: Very difficult to change roles or move up within HR
Advice: None
Pros: Chasing Zero plan to achieve net zero along our value chain by 2030

Cons: Pay - You dont get pay at the market rate. Promotion - "who you know" is important to get a promotion. Sometimes you realize that the job you are applying for was already reserved for somebody but they had to publish in public ( because of the laws). Sometimes, they dont even publish the job req.
Advice: Run another wave of "equal pay" report and please focus on your "loyal" employees. Why pay more to somebody that you hire externally when you can improve the performance &amp; loyalty of your current employee? Retention is the key if you want to become a true Cloud company.
Pros: WLB - People are not trying to step on you and you get a decent WLB Change - Everything changes every year and keeping up with those changes require attention. So you dont get bored Global - You really experience the global company feel working with people from so many different cultures

Cons: No clear roadmap Leadership decisions can improve
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance Decent Pay

Cons: Big company. Easy to get siloed.
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of new development using leading technologies.

Cons: Weak Engineering Leadership (RESTON Office) - A long-time supervisor in particular, who lets his team defend for themselves - Instills an insecure, and untrustworthy work environment - Uses different strokes for different folks, groups, and favoritism at its peak - Forget defending, he nitpicks his own team members on anyone's complaint without evaluating the situation - Apparently, the more one grows, the more insecure the supervisor becomes here - Steals team's work for his self-promotion, even applauded by higher-ups - Shamelessly asks for a 10 rating in team meetings and resorts to micro-managing if he suspects anyone's not obliging. Poor Engineering Work Culture (RESTON Office) - Long-time arrogant Tech leads and Architects use bullying tactics on team members (thanks to spineless supervisors) - Teams remain constantly pressurized by staying defensive and collecting proof to save face - Almost a full-fledged Asian work culture in play but with special treatment for Westerners, who are far and in between. Old Engineering Technologies (RESTON Office) - Outdated models in play, very slow to embrace the latest and the greatest - No transparency in Tech proceedings, only a select few get to call the shots - Only a select few (again preferred old-timers) get to work on "what matters", and others are entrust to their people bargain skills. Inefficient HR - Pathetic coordination with Engineering managers - Each one to fend for his own visa, because HR needs the manager's input, and a "Manager" is not supposed to get involved in visa decisions. So, please contact the HR! - Not to mention weak and useless Legal supporting teams.
Advice: Engineering and technologies are the backbones of a Tech company like SAP. Please invest in the right engineering people and philosophy with special attention to revamping tech management and their presence going forward.
Pros: Company's Reputation - Identified as one of the most sort-after companies to work for by employees. Company's Vision - The CEO and team seem to be doing good. RSUs, Benefits - Gives a reason to make merry on every anniversary.

Cons: Lower salary Low benefits/perks ( compared to what it was a decade ago)
Advice: Make SAP what it was more than a decade ago.
Pros: Good Work life balance Good people to work with

Cons: Overly complex internal processes make the job near impossible
Advice: None

Pros: Very cool company to work for

Cons: Not much cons, leadership was ok
Advice: None
Pros: Pay was pretty good and

Cons: My current manager here in United States is the opposite of my director. She doesn't care of my opinions, and tries to take control instead of empowering the team.
Advice: None
Pros: This is a great place to work within my team. They are care about your mental health and what is best for the team. They listen to your ideas and empower you to make the team better. My director is in Europe and their mindset for employees is a lot better than in United States.

Cons: West coast US colleagues are often at risk of layoffs because of higher salaries.
Advice: None
Pros: Good, work life balance and nice colleagues

Cons: CoE org is limited in career growth. Compensation can and has been an issue in comparison to competitors, but this can be said to be a company-wide issue. In the US, most of the more technical job opportunities will be found on the west coast and not so much on the east. While the CoE can be a good professional start out of university, you're better off seeking either different positions internally or looking elsewhere for upward mobility.
Advice: While inflation is still very much an issue these days, competitors have been more aggressive when it comes to compensation despite what has been announced to employees from top down. I understand budget cuts have significantly affected many companies these days, but SAP needs to work on compensation in order to retain talent.
Pros: Very large company with many world office locations. Therefore there's a lot to choose from in terms of positions if you'd like to switch things up. NSQ office is large and provides ample resources for employees.

Cons: Constant churn of employer leadership
Advice: None

Cons: Internal systems/processes like pricing or deal desk approvals are agonizingly painful.
Advice: Be transparent with reps of why things need to be done a certain way.
Pros: There is an abundance of resources to help you team sell.

Cons: Complicated Org structures and massive restructuring
Advice: Keep going on the change to a Cloud operating model and focus on customer adoption and success.
Pros: Exciting opportunities to build SAP for the future and establish as a leader in Cloud business software

Cons: Some unnecessarily over-engineered development processes that slow down creativity. Having a (luckily) large install base to support can make it tougher to move fast on changing/adding new technology. Can be very difficult to find colleagues working on related topics to gain synergy and collaborate. Going a little too far on some DEI initiatives and fear it will create more division than inclusion.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company, fair treatment of employees but there's always the exceptional great or not-so-great manager that can make or break it. Good focus on innovation and personal/skills growth. Pros which may vary between teams are: Good training/growth opportunities, flexibility in working style, trust and delegated decision making, ability to raise concerns or new ideas with little risk, good camaraderie among colleagues. Very strong focus on helping the customer and end-users. Lots of interest in how to incorporate new technology and capabilities.

Cons: Continuous change in organizational structure
Advice: None
Pros: Technology and strategy are top notch

Cons: Never know when the shoe will drop as it relates to layoffs.
Advice: None
Pros: Salary, bonus, employee stock purchase plan

Cons: I have not enjoyed not having anything to do. I feel as though I am falling behind in my career and I will never ever get a promotion. There is very little to do for associate consultants across my whole team as well, so I am not sure why they hired like 10 of us to just sit around and do nothing.
Advice: Management needs to understand who is working for them and how to get them the help they need to advance their careers. 40 people to 1 team is way too many.
Pros: I have done about 10 hours of work a week for the past year and a half, so most days I just wait for a notification and attend my meetings and that's it.

Cons: Big focus on Early Talent. Needs to also appriciate the +40 :-)
Advice: None
Pros: Flat org. big independence in your role

Cons: big company is a big con for sap
Advice: None
Pros: flexibility is a big pro for sap

Cons: Hiring freeze for New Grads.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance. Large scope projects

Cons: Head and shoulders above other big tech companies, not sure there is a con. If anything maybe just that the transition of on prem customers to cloud is slower than plan in some countries?
Advice: None
Pros: Culture, Benefits, Work Life Balance, Pledge to Flexibility in Work Location, Colleagues are Quality Professionals, Strong Brand/Stable

Cons: None that I can think of at the moment
Advice: Keep promoting the young talent
Pros: The customers, company values, and work-life balance

Cons: The industry changes so rapidly you need to keep up on trends and product innovation. SAP is at times slow to the water and for good reason. We do a good job of avoiding fabs and are in it for the long term. Which is not as sexy as the fintechs and startups who are in it to win it out of the gate.
Advice: Keep up the good work and I appreciate the support.
Pros: Love working at SAP. Main reason is the culture. We are a true team through thick and thin. I have been here going on 10 years and pray for 10 more. Long Live SAP!!!

Cons: poor mgmt, micro manager, too many company politics, tons of tech debt, high attrition
Advice: when you say unlimited pto, mean it, dont cap it at 15 days - better work life balance for engineers, get rid of the engingeering manager
Pros: remote work, flexible pto, benefits, nice laptop

Cons: Culture of tenured employees often not sharing information with newer members or across teams. When there is downsizing or other austerity measures dependent on the market, it appears the US always bears the brunt and Germany is left untouched.
Advice: Put the same effort into topics such as DEI into knowledge sharing and responsive communications across SAP. It's easy to feel like an outsider.
Pros: Salary &amp; total comp, benefits, WLB are all competitive.

Cons: Slow paced. Growth opportunities are not great esp outside the HQ
Advice: None
Pros: Great if you work for teams working with enterprise customers directly. You will get to learn the business processes. Colleagues are smart and the company culture is great

Cons: Leadership has forced move to cloud which both cannibalizes existing customer base and opens up risk of competition. Legal is well established, which is a double edge as there is limited opportunity for advancement, and much advancement is reserved for friends of legal leadership Relatively low pay compared to industry.
Advice: Don’t sacrifice what you are for what you could be
Pros: Solid product that has great stickiness. Due to switching costs, there’s high retention. Product often sells it self. Legal function is well developed and provides many resources to do the job.

Cons: Sometimes there are to few account to sell to in your territory
Advice: None
Pros: Good salary, good co-workers, great company

Cons: small space to get promition
Advice: None

Pros: Smart, conscientious people. Friendly, collaborative. Good work life balance.

Cons: Big company processes (bureaucracy), operate too lean for a big company, long hours
Advice: Please invest in initiatives fully until complete, and fund the change you want to see
Pros: Great benefits, above average salaries (outside of Silicon Valley), big on diversity and inclusion culture

Cons: pay is not high and some company political changes
Advice: None
Pros: Good work and life balance with good working environment

Cons: can be hard to navigate at times, but everyone is super helpful.
Advice: be nimble, adjust to the market, keep innovating

Cons: Not always a consideration for personal time

Advice: Remember that keeping someone who is causing bad environment because they are producing, does not help the future. Good people will see bad being rewarded and leave.
Pros: The culture is improving. There are still people who don't embrace the change but it feels like they are being asked to step up or step off. So the number of them is reducing.

Cons: None. Everything was perfect. Good management.
Advice: None
Pros: Everything is good in this company

Cons: Board doesn't have details to make decisions so makes decisions with a broad brush. Leadership isn't integrated with their teams. If you are over 50 and highly compensated you have a target on your back.

Advice: None
Pros: - Flexible work hours with better work/life balance - Design team is great - Good food - 401k match

Cons: We bought too many companies and didn't do enough cultural change management to bring the disparate teams together and get everyone on the same page. Teams are running wild trying to make their mark and become knowns versus working as one voice. The changes from 2020 caused more problems than it solved.
Advice: Acceleration requires a clear path to execute. Clear the way. Solving customer problems and challenges with using our software brings just as much value as aligning with why customer's purchased our software in the first place.
Pros: The 99% of the people and 90% of the managers I have had the privilege to work with have been the best. There is A LOT of opportunity to do great things and make a positive impact.

Pros: Benefits and profit sharing are great

Cons: Sr Management has deteriorated massively. Abusive managers seem to be the norm - it never was prior and I have been here 12 continuous years. I would avoid anything to do with Digital Supply Chain - their NA leader is the worst and no one will address her toxicity nor will they address the toxicity of her line managers. Career advancement is based on where you live and your gender
Advice: Clean house and start over.
Pros: Great pay and benefits however you work for it

Cons: no comments at this time

Pros: Very great opportunity for “early talent” sales individuals which SAP defines as 2 - 4 years of prior sales experience. The Sales Academy is a 9-10 month rotational program (two classroom experiences and two field experiences) which then places you in a quota carrying role after you “graduate”. The academy is a very well known program both at SAP and externally. It involves early talent from all over the globe so it’s a very diverse program that provides great training and sales exposure.

Pros: Large Ecosystem Well Recognized Good Benefits

Cons: Even with an internal cloud transformation underway martech and CRM systems and processes lag and aren’t cutting edge - ‘the cobbler’s children never wear shoes’. Processes can be daunting and like any large org things take ages for funding, approval, and access. From my perspective all the tech innovation goes to customers. You’d better bring your own innovation, force your team to experiment with tech and new marketing, or outsource with agencies because you won’t learn modern marketing at SAP.
Advice: None
Pros: Wonderful colleagues, great solutions and customers, great culture and DEI, nice benefits and pay, good career trajectory. Remote roles and work is the norm. Many career opportunities exist since this is a 100K org.

Cons: can be slow and bureaucratic at times
Advice: None
Pros: benefits are good for what they are

Cons: That being said, I was bitter over not being bitter. I had been re-assigned to a different project last year and it was intolerably difficult to affect any change. There is a prevalent sense the company should be Agile, but no one, with any influence, was willing to criticize very slow, essentially Waterfall practices. My team and other teams were re-assigned but we had little training and were given few tasks to do; it would take several months to actually get features - fairly small in anyone's definition - shipped. New projects would be planned and talent would not be assigned. It was a huge waste of resources. Meanwhile, our competitors were soldiering ahead. In this environment, one inevitably thinks about their own career. This hurt because I like the company. I understand Rome wasn't built in a day. And, with Scrum, it's not about blaming anyone. But that's my honest opinion. My hope is that other domains in SAP take the actions to be and remain competitive.
Advice: None
Pros: I was part of the North America layoffs for SAP. I don't feel all too bad, because I thought SAP was rather courteous about it - given the recent news of other companies' layoffs, I got a message ahead of time, a month of sort-of not-really "employment" (to look for another role in the company, if possible), and general help with my sort-of not-really "unemployment". I mention all this because SAP, and I, prided the company's "family" values. It did seem the company cared about the employees. During the pandemic and after there wasn't a point where my arm was twisted and I was forced to do so-and-so. My team and I worked at our own pace and took the breaks we needed for our mental health - and we worked better for it. While I considered other opportunities in the past, this culture really stuck out to me and I felt this would have been rare in other companies. All the compensation in the word really doesn't touch upon this.

Cons: Board is out of touch for a tech company and todays culture. Pay is less then other tech companies. Little growth for admins which is discouraging. Coming from an outside firm prior to SAP EA positions at SAP operate more as an admin assistant. Which is odd when COS positions at SAP positions are more of a sr EA position.
Advice: Value your admins and promote them up to COS or project manager positions
Pros: Easy job for the industry. Good teams that treat you well and value you.

Cons: has a old tech stack
Advice: None
Pros: lots of benefits such as stock, insurance and 6% match

Cons: - like any company, some leaders exhibit bad behavior but are not held accountable. This is getting better. - if you are not a woman or a visible minority, your career may face headwinds regardless of how good you are at your job compared to those peers. I suppose they are making up for past hiring practices, but quotas of any kind can be de-motivating.
Advice: None
Pros: - Lots of structure and courses to help you learn - Excellent benefits and salary - Ability to move laterally to grow your career

Pros: Great Learning and a wonderful place to grow

Cons: -A lot of information to learn and your job is relevant on how much you know -Training is great but its a data dump - make sure you take good notes -There is a lot of internal coordination - you have endless resources which sounds amazing but you need to know what resource and when to engage them. You will play a lot of "musical calendars" -Organization!!!! If you are not organized this job can take a toll on you - you are the owner of your account and its your responsibility to do everything for that account from scheduling meetings to taking care of administrative work
Advice: -The training process could be better. Its a data dump and studies show a retention of about 10% of that data. If this was more interactive the retention would go up.
Pros: -Flexible work schedule -Treats you like an adult -Allows you to run your territory without micro management -Great benefits -Family first - always supports you if you have family matters come up -Pays well -PTO is great -DEI is apart of the corporate DNA and they take that seriously -Fun working environment -Remote - there is an office in most cities that you can work at if you want too, but you can also work from home. You get to choose when you travel and can customize your schedule as needed -No such thing as "work life balance" - what I mean by that is they are so flexible that its very much so get your work done however that looks for you. That way if you need to pick kids up from school, go to the doctor, etc do it, and then work when you can! This is the BEST feeling. No stress or anxiety of needing to take care of basic life needs. -Some of the best employees! Everyone is willing to help where they can - I have yet to have someone push something off on me, or be unsupportive. The staff at SAP is a tenure staff and have been doing this a long time, therefore they are so knowledgeable and willing to support newer employees.

Advice: None
Pros: Enphasis in work life balance
