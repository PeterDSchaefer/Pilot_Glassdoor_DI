Cons: Micromanagement
From Senior Management, Management, Team Lead expect this at all level. 
I don't mean to be Race discrimination here. 90% from this Telecom Division (EMS/OSS( are Indian origin hence expect a Indian working culture. 

No Work/Life environment
when working with this division expect to work 12-16 hours/day, haft of the time work on weekend and in my case as T3 support expect to work/attend Maintenance Window (12AM-5AM) during software upgrade. More over. You are expect report upgrade process at 9AM internal meeting. There are only 4 people in the T3 team and each group is 2 people, hence rotation is every other week. I wish I have known this working hours, hence no-transparent is the norm. Shouldn't there be a working hour law, requirement and disclosure?

Growth and Development.
Learn/train on your own from documents and internal Video session
Documents/MOP are un-organize,. Try to find the people who last updated the document and/or latest document on his PC.
Advice: None
Pros: New 5G technology, employee package.

Cons: Under-paid, over-worked, under-valued, no respect, micromanaged, mind numbing work at every level, awful benefits. 100% honesty: do not work here......the workplace culture is truly awful in all aspects.
Advice: Complete restructure
Pros: There really are none at all.

Cons: Horrible work environment with poor management.
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits and compensation is average.

Cons: Unorganized, answers from Korea not from this office.
Advice: None
Pros: Electronic deals for employees and friends

Cons: - Can't use your amazing PTO because the company is so short-staffed, there is no one to cover for you
- Work/life balance is non-existent (between the insane amount of work and calls at midnight with HQ, when are you supposed to sleep?)
- Leadership just does whatever HQ (S. Korea) tells them to do, which changes daily
- Impossible to be promoted
Advice: You cannot expect employees to work 60+ hour work weeks every week with little to no burn out. It would be one thing if there was a coherent and consistent strategy, but there is literally no strategy. Everything boils down to "beat Apple" (sorry.. "beat LO"), or... "what is the competition doing? Ok do that but faster and cheaper." 

It's a great company to have on the resume, but get in and get out. Even 10+ year veterans are running for the hills.
Pros: - Amazing pay and quarterly bonus (managers &amp; above)
- Great health insurance
- Good PTO policy
- Great employee discount on products

Cons: People get fired a lot.  Get the impression that if you don’t flatter / impress the right people you are done for. 

It’s a big company and people don’t really know what different parts of the org do, and within an org people don’t know why or how things work. 

Very difficult to get promoted.
Advice: People are scared and trust is low.  Be patient in fixing those problems.
Pros: Quite a lot of control and ability to get things done (until you don’t) 
You can dream up an idea and go do it very frequently. 
Benefits are pretty good.

Cons: Executive management change with inadequate communications has resulted in challenges across the org with many lay offs and employees concerned on whats next
HR does not manage strategically, they are just order takers and resulted in chaos
Morale is down with many people now leaving
Advice: CEO and C-Suite needs to better lead and engage teams to drive up morale
They need to value people better vs treat as a commodity if they want to retain
Pros: Great Brand and great products
People are mostly very smart, ambitious, hard working, helpful and typically humble
Environment is fast paced (which I like), and with sales growth during CV-19 lockdown bonus rewards have been good

Cons: Work/life balance varies greatly by department and compensation, and growth opportunities are not equal across departments. High stressed departments are expected to do more with less resources and expertise. High stress departments do not value experienced individuals or a non-stressed work enviorment.
Advice: listen and put more value into the employees that work in departments that are having high turn over.
Pros: Great place to get experience of what you want and don't want out of a job. High turn over enables quick advancement to those that are able to do minimal work and focus on climbing the ladder. Constant state of fire fighting ensures you never get bored.

Cons: - long working hours
- broken process for any of the standard marketing support 
- leadership pressure to drive high sales at all times and you get penalized if results are poor 
- no improvements to existing processes since no support from leadership or other teams are given either due to long working hours or just not interested 
- people either quit or get fired on an annual basis that makes the work even harder to execute
Advice: Provide more resources to help improve many of the broken processes and give less stress to working level for poor sales results.
Pros: - well paid depending on your division/team
- global company brand value

Cons: Ultra toxic environment, be prepared to be overlooked for promotions and growth opportunities if you're not Korean or don't have connections to upper management
Incompetent peers
Advice: This company is on course to become the next Nokia, Blackberry. The culture and predominant values do not support a competitive player within Tech. Inability to attract talent with current culture
Legacy (Korean) employees want things to stay as it is and view smart incoming employees as a threat. This place is a mess
Pros: stepping stone to better opportunities in Tech
fairly good signal on Resume of having worked at large global player

Cons: Company still hasn't adopted wider work flexibility though it leads the IT industry on many other reputation.
Advice: Allow more flexibility for working remote and flexible hours to accommodate different conditions especially the working class with family. Otherwise, it could imply it only wants to hire singles or one of the single-like married.
Pros: The company is super fast in driving innovative products and ideas. It's rewarding to work in partnership with other talented colleagues.

Cons: Horrible lack of leadership, strategic vision, failure to adapt to a changing world. Its a manufacturing company to its core. If you do something that doesn't contribute to manufacturing, then you're viewed as an expense, a liability to be cut and not an asset.
Advice: Nothing that hasn't been shared in hundreds of exit interviews already.
Pros: If you feel you've benefitted from working at Samsung, and that there is a good healthy supportive culture, congratulations - you're one of the good people. And *you* are the source of that goodness. Continue to do what you do and don't let Samsung get you down.

Cons: There is simply too much work. They need to hire more people to handle some tasks, but they don't. Most of the time, I had to work from 7:30 AM to 7 PM, only taking 30 min lunch break. Upper management doesn't really care about the workload you have, as long as they get what they want.
Advice: None
Pros: Samsung's health benefit is great along with other employee benefits such as employee discounts, bonuses, PTO hours ...etc

Cons: Salary is slightly above average. But no stock (except if you are VP and above). Can't compete with large tech talent pool that way.
Work-life balance.
Advice: Offer stock to Director and below levels.
Pros: You'll always discover new ways to grow within your role. 
Leaders invest in developing you.
Great products.
The Koreans treat you very well, especially if you're a top performer.
Trips to Korea once a year.
Company does a great job for large events.

Cons: Work life balance is terrible, pretty much non-existent
Rampant discrimination and bias from upper management
Hostile work environment
Too much gossip
No inclusion
Company doesn't reflect its "values" - the "values" are there just for pandering purposes
Upper Management does not care at all about staff
Bullying and harassment in the workplace
managers constantly undermine you
All talk, no action
They will try to "trap" you there. if you know your worth, get out or better yet, don't work there in the first place
Advice: Stop being bigots
Pros: Benefits are OK. PTO is pretty good but you can never use it because as management loves to say, "put in more OT!!"

Cons: Oversight from Korea feels like you report into two leadership teams at times. Unstainable appetite for reporting and data that detracts from ability to manage day to day business tasks. No stock options. Career advancements only occur during one period annually.
Advice: Continue to modernize the employee perk and the work life balance to attract and retain top talent.
Pros: Great pay and benefits. Work life balance is improving. Stepping out of the early 2000's and making efforts to modernize employee perks similar to other large tech player (i.e Peloton reimbursement).

Cons: 1) executive leadership is seldom aligned which constantly creates internal/interdepartmental conflicts of business interest which then need to be resolved on top of all else to get done. 
2) LOTS of corporate red tape. bring scissors.
Advice: None
Pros: 1) salary + 20% bonus (avg bonus offered, so I’ve heard)
2) it adds perceived value to your personal brand

Cons: Unorganized, no accountability, the VP is too involved and gets in the way with production. The supervisors are treated like crap. Working long hours (12-15hrs). Extremely short staff, supervisors are expected to do grunt work and not really supervise. High turnover rate amongst supervisors.
Advice: Listen to your people when they ask for help.
Pros: Great place for those interested in getting managerial experience.

Cons: hours are all over, management tells you they are there for you and are only there for the company. Don't bother trying to talk or ask for help
Advice: Learn to truly care about your employees and work with them to make them happy and enjoy their workplace.
Pros: Pay is decent, employee discounts are dependent on the item

Cons: Still has a top-down more rigid style, but this has evolved significantly towards a more modern approach.
Advice: None
Pros: Samsung's aggressive approach towards increasing market share means there is always capital being spent and new challenges to address. I have never been concerned about the security of my job or gotten bored from dealing with the same old problems.

Cons: I applied, interviewed and was hired for one position but I was suddenly in a different position as of my start date. Time off is absolutely terrible, no trust in employees, management is extremely disorganized. Most employees are very negative, unhappy and vocal about it. The entire environment is smothering, depressing and stressful.
Advice: None
Pros: The salary is halfway decent

Cons: Samsung is focused on device sales not developing solutions to business problems. Currently, Finance personnel are running the company as many of the business unit leaders are not empowered to take risk and grow,

Pros: Enjoyed working for a Korean company that has a global footprint across many business units.

Cons: No work life balance. Unless you are from Korea you have no decision making ability
Advice: The locals know the business better, let them run it. Stop waisting money on large meetings that don't go anywhere. Get ride of the 1 year contract for Korean Executives. Will allow them endorse and engage in longer range stratagies.
Pros: Great pay and colleges are awesome

Cons: The environment would like you to work 24/7 and not have any personal issues because no one cared, they just wanted results. 
not much room for growth
Advice: None
Pros: My managers were supportive and made me feel like I worked with them vs for them which helped morale and productivity.

 All because of Volkswagen says it can do a 100 of speedometer doesn't mean you should do it daily.
Pros: Good branded company with good customer service.

Cons: Don't care about there workers...at all!! A lady had a heart attack. They made everyone go back to work,and say there was nothing we could do for her. They

U will start feeling the heat of there weakness within 10 days of work . People come here for name of Samsung but gets worst leadership ever.

Lots of opportunities BUT toxic culture
