Cons: Some of the software systems used internally can be annoying. But nothing of complaint with workload or management.
Advice: None
Pros: Truly love working for Roche. They really know how to take care of their people.

Cons: To grow within the company you have to be willing to move to other areas of the business and to relocate.
Advice: None
Pros: Company culture, growth opportunities, compensation and benefits, and great leadership profiles.

Cons: With being such a large company, innovations won't happen as quick as with other companies. Many checks and balances
Advice: None
Pros: A great company and culture to work for. Really value work/life balance and everyone is happy to help each other.

Cons: - constant re-orgs, and there's never a well thought out plan, so the people at the bottom are constantly being thrown into chaos
- the quality of the leadership team decreases with each re-org; leaders are chosen based on favoritism, not on knowledge or skills
- leaders have no commitment to patients or quality, they only care about lining their pockets
- training sucks
- people who actually care and try to make improvements are labeled complainers and are not given opportunities to advance, or they're laid off
- hypocrisy, lies, gaslighting, double standards
Advice: you keep repeating "transparency, respect and fairness" in all the town halls, but actions speak louder than words
Pros: - good benefits
- some really amazing coworkers (until they get laid off)

Cons: Hard to learn the business because it’s so large
Advice: None
Pros: Great people
Great benefits
Hybrid work

Cons: Work/Life balance is strained for field employees
Advice: None
Pros: Compensation, Vacation time, premium healthcare

Cons: - Professional development is LACKING. They’ll tell you that there are plenty of opportunities to cross train, or that you can speak to your manager about taking on new responsibilities. Your average manager (with the exception of an amazing few) is not going to give up the resource that you are unless they are absolutely forced too. You will not get that opportunity because they can’t make it work. And you won’t get anymore responsibility because that’s how they make themselves look good.
- Speaking of managers, most of them don’t care about you in the slightest. Some of them actively despise you. One of the higher ups even joked and giggled when mentioning some layoffs we had gone through about 4 months prior. Sickening behavior.
- The planners for this site aren’t the best. Forgetting to put things on a schedule is one thing. Doing it literally multiple times a month and making everyone rush to figure it out is another.
- While most people here just want to get through the work day and go home, some of them want to make your day as difficult as possible. They will usually ruin it for the others.
Advice: It’s one thing to try to use as little labor as possible for efficiency sake. It’s another to actively gut a department (or multiple) by 20-40% in one fell swoop and then expect them to produce as much or more. We shouldn’t have to beg you for help.
Also, sometimes I’m sick. Sometimes an employee has to go become a dad for the first time and needs to take paternity leave. Sometimes someone gets hurt and needs to be out a few weeks. Those aren’t metrics. That’s just life and it shouldn’t be used against us as much as it is. It almost feels like you hate us sometimes, but I know better than that. To hate something you need to care about it. And the last few years have made it clear you don’t care about your employees anywhere near as much as you tell us, if at all.
Pros: - Pay is good and benefits are great.
- Most of the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful when an issue arises or a mistake is made. If there’s anything you want to learn about this industry, you’re going to be learning it from them, so get to know them.
- Very little work to take home with you if you aren’t a supervisor/manager.

Cons: Work/Life balance is a challenge
Career advancement limited
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits/comp
Great culture
Great attitudes

Cons: Have to wake up before the sun.
Advice: None
Pros: Payed good money and good people

Cons: Management needs work, less about employees and more about the bottom line, its what is expected
Advice: Please listen to our requests
Pros: Great atmosphere, great people, best benefits around

Cons: As we recently got integrated in Roche, we still have to adapt to complete Roche culture
Advice: None
Pros: Good company culture and growth mindset

Cons: Recent transformations and organizational structure changes have not always seemed logical and have created an environment of instability, which negatively affects morale
Advice: Continuous improvement and optimization of how we do things is extremely important for us to stay competitive, but leadership should really look at the end benefit of a given change to ensure you are not making things worse
Pros: Everyone is very passionate about what they do since our mission is to help patients afflicted with cancer; Benefits are amazing

Cons: travel can be a lot at times
Advice: None
Pros: Great Culture and Team mates

Cons: Large organization so there can be a lot of red tape and difficulty with communication. Management can be rather opaque.
Advice: Clearer communication and a more forthright approach. Do not spare the details - we're all grownups, and we can handle negative things when they arise.
Pros: Excellent benefits, phenomenal colleagues, great culture, impactful and meaningful work

Cons: Many long-time employees and leaders lack the drive and passion to do great work. They have become comfortable and complacent.
Advice: None
Pros: Steady business that grows consistently

Cons: Some days where a little slow and manager was to busy to find something new for us to work on
Advice: None
Pros: Diverse Workspace with many business groups to learn from

Cons: Nothing is wrong with the company
Advice: None
Pros: A good supportive great company

Cons: Sometimes Roche moves very very slow. They are a methodical company so don’t expect to get things done fast
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay, even better products so they are easy to market

Cons: They are hyper focused on DEI rather than the right skillful person for the job company wide
Advice: None
Pros: If you are the selected few you will go far

Cons: Roche values are just catch phrases. Ultimately, many leaders don’t follow them or openly mock them. They aren’t held accountable to them. Apparently no mandatory leader training to improve their people skills. A bad leader is allowed to be a bad leader indefinitely and without accountability. Illogical spending. Blow a ton of cash on a cafeteria that didn’t need replacing and have a manufacturing space that needed expansion 5+ years ago. Nickel and diming that project now.
Advice: Critically evaluate leaders and replace bad leaders. Apparently, management is not evaluated on how well they live the Roche values and treat their workers. As long as they brown nose their superiors, they keep the job. I know the HR (P&amp;C) response will be that management is evaluated on living Roche values, but there is no evidence to support it. Mid/upper leadership is not held accountable for poor GEOS results, either. If leaders were held accountable to values or GEOS, my leader would have been replaced by now…
Pros: Decent pay, good benefits. Some work/life balance and flexibility depending on where you work. R&amp;D seems to have very flexible schedules. Site CEO (Jill) genuinely seems to care about worker wellbeing and making it a good workplace. My criticism of leadership does not apply to her.

Cons: It was bought out by a larger company
Advice: None
Pros: It was a start up

Cons: Less remuneration when compared with other companies
Advice: None
Pros: Tech/Startup Culture in Product Mgmt

Cons: Multiple transformations resulting in constant changes
Advice: None
Pros: Innovative product portfolio, Good people

Cons: The fundamental underpinnings of strategy is making choices. However, I find that Roche tries to do everything. As a result, folks can be become over worked with activity.
Advice: Focus.
Pros: Roche pays well and being on the north side of Indianapolis, location is a major plus.

Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, work-life balance, team collaborations

Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and culture, they take very good care of their employees

Cons: Some locations/positions have terrible work life balance. Roche is highly political and slow to deliver.
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work but highly dependent on your location and manager

Cons: High pressure, tight deadlines, long hours
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and upward mobility at this site

Cons: My manager was a Shared Services manager with no concept of IT or Security so she was not able to give me the support I needed to understand and collaborate on my role responsibilities. As a result, she managed based on meaningless tasks and how many hours she could get me to spend on them. She didn't understand that 10+ programs was too many for 1 person to fully understand, and maintain. Security was not centralized within the company so different departments were doing different things with no collaboration. Security was not taken seriously. Managers wanted to do the least and have me sign off on whatever. I had numerous privacy concerns that were part of their minimum security requirements that were not addressed. The company hasn't adopted a framework they plan to stick to. Overall, I felt like the fall person for when they eventually have a major breach or fall out with some privacy law like GDPR.
Advice: Centralize your security efforts and adopt a framework like ISO 27001 that will hold each program to security standards and provide value to your customers. Do not have  people who have never been technical, manage technical and security people. 
Pros: The benefits were awesome. I used the maternity leave and I really appreciated being out for 12 weeks instead of the traditional 6 weeks. I'm guessing this is because they are not a U.S. originated company. I also had the opportunity to work with really smart people.

Cons: changes in the organization may happen unexpectedly
Advice: None
Pros: good benefits with fairly ok health benefits

Cons: Sometimes Working in Ambiguity (not a real issue unless aren't comfortable)

Cons: Slow career growth, salary not as competitive as other medtechs.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and flexible work hours
Rewarding work resulting in improved patient care

Cons: The work culture has gone downhill since Ventana was purchased. It is a strong "hustle" culture, where everyone views you either as a threat or someone to step on to get ahead. It can be quite toxic if you do not immediately fit in.
Advice: Pay your people! My role had lost 2 employees less than 2 months apart, and I got pushed into the role with less pay.
Pros: The benefits are great, really nice PTO accommodations.

Cons: Roche is not in many locations in the US and should be. We need more corporations like Roche.

Cons: Leadership do not care a lot about people.

Pros: Good molecules and great pharma innovation

Cons: Many levels of bureaucracy limit the agility to get things done sometimes
Advice: None

Cons: constantly changing plan, upper management's decisions are confusing
Advice: None
Pros: great benefits, friendly work culture, always something new to do

Cons: - Pay is drastically different between RDO and RDC for the same position
- Consistent "reorgs" make it hard to know who it responsible for what
- No accountability for anything
- Raises are computer generated and it doesn't matter what is accomplished during the year everyone get the same raise outside of management.
Advice: Start holding people accountable and stop using computers for end of year raises.
Pros: - Benefits such as healthcare, PTO, etc. are all great
- Pay is ok

Advice: None
Pros: Easy going environment. Everyone is kind and helpful for the most part.

Cons: - Lots of burocracy
- Too many meetings
- Sometimes too much talk about change and too little action
Advice: None
Pros: - Company with a mission to help cancer patients
- Very collaborative environment

Cons: Processes are overblown and operational innovation is discouraged in favor of maintaining the cumbersome status quo. If you're not a "lifer" then you "obviously don't understand how business is done here". Complex bureaucracies dominate the management landscape, more so than other companies of similar size. Corporate leaders will hand down edicts with little consideration of the impact on people and processes that are affected, as long as senior managers are satisfied. Many middle managers are zealots who spout out vision statements without living up to those values.
Advice: Figure out how to transfer the concept of innovation from your product and solutions into your core business operations. Treat people of all tenures like human beings and not chess pieces. Live all your values, not just those which are most convenient.
Pros: Pay is insane, benefits are solid, and opportunities for growth are probably very good. Crazy talented people at the individual contributor level.

Cons: not culturally sound work environment
Advice: None
Pros: quarterly bonus and health insurance

Cons: Lower wages compared to other companies locally
Senior management does not understand day-to-day operations and tends to micromanage things they don't understand
Very little/slow upward mobility
Advice: Listen to your people and don't just look at them as numbers. Provide growth opportunities and mentorship and don't just come to the department when something is wrong. Provide positive feedback.
Pros: Good benefits and a relaxed crowd, volunteer opportunities, and communications from the top down are great

Cons: Actually it is difficult to get a fix term contract
Advice: None
Pros: So many depending the position and location

Cons: bureaucracy, politics, slow, process driven
Advice: None
Pros: Culture, talent, science driven, good leaders

Cons: Decisions are often made purely by the impact to bottom line without regard to individuals
Advice: None
Pros: When being in a big business there is increased job security, but can sometimes feel like working for the government

Cons: Poor (corporate) senior management that's disconnected to operations and lack long term vision

Cons: Great Management, Support and development
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, flexibility, support, growth

Cons: Horizontal career growth, increase salary.
Advice: None
Pros: Technical development, Benefits, Job Rotation.

Cons: Poorly defined departmental duties and individual roles. Initiatives tend to be rolled out without adequate communication between departments impacted. We seem to manage ourselves most of the time, but at a certain point this can be frustrating and at times feels like we are set up to fail.
Advice: This is one of the best jobs I've ever had, but that is being overshadowed by the feeling that we are not appreciated by management and management does not fully understand the work we do.
Pros: The work is challenging and I enjoy my day-to-day tasks. I feel I am well paid. I genuinely like and respect my co-workers. I also enjoy assisting and interacting with customers.

Cons: Getting into Roche can be difficult, they prefer hiring contractors for a lot of roles recently
Advice: None
Pros: Decent money, great work environment

Cons: Work life balance is not balanced
Advice: Listen to the employees actually doing the work that needs improvement.
Pros: Pay and benefits responsibilities usually acceptable for positions

Cons: They have changed everything to remote. Since the pandemic and HAVING to do remote training to survive doesn't mean after pandemic (which Roche made A LOT of money from) they need to approve more travel and get together for teams. And not to hangout and meet each other but to get work done!
Advice: See above
Pros: Best in class insurance and other benefits 
Access to job development 
A lot of autonomy

Cons: Lots of traveling, some assignments lasting a month or more
Advice: None
Pros: Company car and all expense paid for travel

Cons: Where do I even start. 1) Be prepared to always get the line, "You're salaried, you should be working for as long as we tell you." While this is ok sometimes, it's is definitely not ok all the time. 2) No one (in upper management) gives 2 cookies about your disability, an accident you were in, your kids' schooling or your newborn. Either work and don't complain or get unreasonable work loads and be fired for not working well. 3) Have a dental or doctor's appointment? Sorry but take that during your lunch break but also be available during your lunch break for meetings and how dare you not be available. 4) Top people from Roche are here, act happy everyone! 5) Did I mention the mandatory 8am to 6pm work schedule? No exceptions. 6) I'm management and I'm never wrong, you must be the one doing something wrong. You take care of it, I'm too busy to help you. Honestly, I can go on but that should give you a good idea why the Seattle location is such an awful place to work. There are other great biotechs in Seattle, you'll absolutely regret it if you work here.
Advice: Learn some empathy please. Not everyone has an amazing life like yours.
Pros: If you like being backstabbed by your manager and some choice coworkers, this is the place for you.

Cons: I can't think of any.
Advice: None
Pros: Good place to work and be part of the company.

Cons: No return for all interns in NJ site
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance, learn a lot from managers

Cons: Favoritism for certain employees. Hard to get promotions
Advice: Please consider all aspects of employee contribution 
Pros: Great benefits, good pay, easy job

Cons: Big company feel, pay is lower, lots of projects started and not finished.
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible, lots of opportunities, stable

Cons: Roche uses Accenture as a consulting company, and Accenture consultants are generally clueless individuals who use big words to sound fancy and spark political wars at work. Roche itself has very strict hiring guidelines, but it seems Accenture will hire anyone with a degree which really lowers Roche’s quality. Roche employees are hand picked individuals with certain personality aspects and work ethics, but because of Accenture employees being all over the place, Roche employees aren’t able to focus on what truly matters. Customer satisfaction would truly be higher without Accenture having so much of a say in how customers are handled.
Advice: Pay more attention to the negative effects Accenture consultants have on the business. They know how to sound smart, but there’s no quality behind their words. They’re hurting the business greatly.
Pros: Salary, Bonus, Benefits, Flexibility, Quality Equipment

Cons: Compensation was low for scientists
Advice: None
Pros: Awesome company, nice benefits, and colleagues

Cons: Over the past 5 years, leadership has created a culture that rewards political maneuvering over production and achievement. The cultural value of speaking up is no longer safe to engage in. If you are not sharing positive news, you are not rewarded for making data driven analysis of the current situation.
Advice: Listen to your employees Be data driven, not personality driven Stop rewarding politics and return to valuing employees who deliver
Pros: Employees are quality from across the board in every department Compensation is above average Healthcare mission is genuine

Cons: Constant change in strategy leading to non-stop changes to organizational structures and periodic layoffs
Advice: None
Pros: Strong portfolio, competitive in the industry, well managed

Cons: Came in from the high tech industry as an engineer. Salary is not commiserate to high tech. But, from what I understood from other co-workers, the biotech industry in general does not pay as well. Came out disillusioned about the healthcare industry. I left high tech to help make the world a better place. It is not always about the end patient, but really sometimes about profit.
Advice: None
Pros: Had some really good managers overall. I really like the people in my department at the time. They offered a comprehensive health care plan including psych.

Cons: nothing to add as cons
Advice: Improve new HR operating model for greater customer experience and business impact. Improve DEI efforts
Pros: Great culture, engaging mission &amp; purpose, leadership

Cons: Some divisions teams respected and validated more that others by executive management - and allowed more "grace"; geographically dispersed (global) teams not allowed to travel occasionally to collaborate better and build better relationships (i.e. commercial + engineering + product)
Advice: Definitely some divisions and organizations within Roche have better leaders that teams are now trying to move into
Pros: Good culture at individual teams' levels; trying to be diverse and inclusive; great benefits that need to be taken advantage of

Cons: Little to no growth depending on your department, pay could be much better, too much change and lack of direction for the future of the employees, no optional remote work for lab support
Advice: Pay employees more to retain good and hardworking team members, take risks on FTE who are trying to expand their career growth and branch out in different departments
Pros: Good benefits, good working conditions

Cons: Communication from managers wasn't that great.
Advice: Better communication

Cons: Not much room for advancement
Advice: None
Pros: Great company, great team, great atmosphere. Good benefits. Good place to work and thrive

Cons: Management doesn’t under their staff workflow and tend to implement “solutions” that cause more issues
Advice: None
Pros: Company culture, growth opportunities, pay and benefits

Cons: Good company tomorrow but not so competitive regarding salary and benefits compared with other continuar the business.
Advice: None
Pros: Good company to works, respectful environment.

Cons: Sometimes there is inadequate training.
Advice: None
Pros: Remote work, good pay, great colleagues

Cons: Processes are so complex here that it is stifling
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits, D&amp;I is very embraced

Cons: It is FAR from the high tech company they advertise to be. Wiped out benefits during covid, managers are trash and on yearly employee audits managers get horrible reviews but nothing changes, a revolving door of VIPs take all the funding while they blame the labs working on skeleton crews. VIP's directly tell you it's not about helping people, its about getting them a new yacht (no joke). Tons of office politics, and I've seen some disturbing anti-lgbt actions. Tons of company cover-ups whenever they do any wrongdoing. Not as bad as Thermo, but they will totally screw you over on pay and FTE conversion.
Advice: Fire all of you, you are horrible, yes YOU. Parasites like you should listen to your employees, but you're so entrenched with your politics and cronyism that you wont. STOP THROWING EMPLOYEES UNDER THE BUS WHEN YOU SCREW UP. People literally die from Biotech lagging behind where it should be, because you managers take 45 vacations a year.
Pros: It's not the worst out there, work life balance is treated well.

Cons: Since the new CEO took over Roche Diagnostics things have been going down hill. First a push to get people back in the office with no performance/efficiency reasons stated. Flexible work environment is going away, employees losing choice of whether to work remote or in person for any role. And now occupancy sensors are being installed. Roche is losing its competitive edge in regards to employee compensation and flexible work environments.
Advice: Pay employees at least close the midpoint of the salary range and don't force people back into the office. People will be productivity (or unproductive) regards of where they are, you are just impacting employee satisfaction with your decisions.
Pros: Good benefits, stable work load, opportunity to learn new skills.

Cons: I have found that the Talent Team can at times be competitive which is good if its healthy. In the last 6 months, I have experienced 2 -3 scenarios where my colleagues used " gaslighting" to attempt cause issues for me here at Roche. I enjoy the work but believe even in today's market team work &amp; collaboration should always come before egos and attitudes.
Advice: I would suggest team building exercises that help teams focus on the company values - integrity, courage and passion. 1- integrity i.e. take the high road 2- courage i.e. courage for peers to have tough and honest conversations 3-passion i.e. have a passion for team work as nothing is accomplished by one person it takes a team to build a company.
Pros: It is great to work the business here at Roche. The managers are great about partnering with talent teams and engaged in the process. The best part of my day is supporting their teams and efforts.

Cons: They are wary of "outsiders" - if you haven't been there for 10-15+ years they are skeptical of you, your ideas, and your motives. They don't seem to want to improve - continue to keep and promote the "old guard"
Advice: You say you want innovation and simplicity, yet your culture doesn't.
Pros: Great pay and benefits; a great mission that truly helps society (especially during COVID); generally kind co-workers

Cons: Gossip, gossip gossip....Including managers, everybody talks behind another. It's a shame truly, because Roche company itself has been doing great work in patients' lives. Bad management, instead of teaching the material, they give you bunch of sighs and eye rolls. Sadly, the people are not professionals/ take their jobs seriously. It's a good company if it's your first time job. However, career growth isn't supported. I felt discriminated and excluded throughout my employment.
Advice: They should reevaluate their reasonings of being there. They need to have a professional attitude at all times.
Pros: Stable environment. Unlimited sick days.

Cons: long distance from my home
Advice: None
Pros: good benefits and work life balance

Cons: Heavily matrix organization with too many layers of management
Advice: None
Pros: Company is a Swiss based and has good benefits

Cons: No room for growth or promotion. Showed alot a favoritism to certain employees. I’m the end a lot of people left.
Advice: Invest in employees and promote from within. Too many times I’ve seen new people come into leadership roles with no industry experience. Which would upset the ones who have been with company and have the experience but wasn’t given the chance.
Pros: The Benefits were absolutely amazing.

Cons: Over emphasis on policies (diversity &amp; inclusion and moving jobs to lower cost locations) have created: 1) Limited career growth opportunities 2) Inexperienced and incompetent leadership
Advice: Look at talent valuation vs hitting diversity and cost cutting quotas
Pros: Strong product pipeline and market reputation

Cons: Very Good place to start with
Advice: None
Pros: Nothing, great place to start

Cons: Worst professional environment ever seen in my experience. People discourage others , speak ill of the team and it wasn't a healthy environment place to work with, and I strongly advise HR team to take action items on the same. They do layoff on Full time resource due to their bad financial budgeting and create a lot of chaos.
Advice: None
Pros: Lot of technologies are used and hence you can have a chance to work in various technologies Employer benefits and bonus is good

Cons: Slow growth in the company

Cons: Too big company, slow decisions
Advice: None
Pros: Good company, good benefits, nice place,

Cons: Compensation is not as competitive
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of opportunities to learn

Cons: Nothing bad to say about Roche, as I have not experienced anything negative.
Advice: None
Pros: Roche is great company to work for they hire talented folks. The culture is great and across collaborations among teams is great. Management empowers individuals to make decisions and to challenge when their are doubts.

Cons: Training isn't the best, you'll have to self train in many instances. Internally, the company can be disorganized. Alphabet soup of acronyms can make understanding the landscape and players a real challenge.
Advice: Fix your training program and have a better understanding of ALL the things you do. Vision is too siloed, frequently important changes are made without considering the ramifications across all of Roche's divisions and departments.
Pros: Large company with some top-notch people. The company is enlightened and progressive with lots of opportunity for all sorts of people. There are opportunities to stretch yourself.

Cons: -Arrogant and frankly unqualified management; highly questionable work ethics and non-existent communication between shifts or between managers and employees -Layoff hundreds of employees, only to use employees left from other departments to fill in the gap, displaying lack of foresight -Constant pressure to do more with little-to-no reward -Gradual decline in the perks of the job in spite of personal performance
Advice: None
Pros: -Benefits are well-rounded, although have been slightly worse recently -90 minutes of breaks, 1-hr paid -Most people have a degree of integrity and respect towards one another

Cons: Very high level of cronyism. If you don’t know the right people or have the right friends, you’re not going to move up.
Advice: Be open to hiring people based on their level of experience and competency. It’s not right to place a job opening and not seriously consider the candidates who apply.
Pros: Great Place to Work. Take good care of employees. Great benefits.

Cons: They are not focused on the customer. The processes prevent innovation. Entrenched middle management is powerless and unmotivated. Internal politics and culture suppress getting simple projects from getting done.
Advice: Empower your teams to better support customers, which has inherent risk.
Pros: They make robust regents most of the time and have a brand. The people are nice. If you work there for over 5 years you can maybe promote.

Cons: The cliques are bad. There are no benefits or PTO for contracted employees, and there is no guarantee of being converted to full time status at the conclusion of your contract. Contracted employees are not allowed to use the gym, and do not get the same holidays.
Advice: Respect, value, and train employees to improve retention. Listen to the professional opinions of those doing the work for insight on improving workflow before rolling out changes.
Pros: There are benefits (medical, dental, vision) offered to full Roche employees.

Cons: Random schedules and long days
Advice: None
Pros: Good work culture and bonuses.

Cons: Management is horrible. Now RDO and RDC are being combined back into one. More people to lose their jobs is on the horizon.

Cons: I can’t think of any
Advice: None
Pros: They provide advancement opportunities. They value health of the public. They have outstanding benefits

Cons: There's no feedback loop for subordinates to provide feedback regarding supervisors. I was having problems with my manager and when I talked to leadership, they knew there were some problems with my manager and others but didn't ask me or colleagues what the issues were; we weren't able to speak without feeling we would be penalized.
Advice: Manage your supervisors
Pros: If you're local to your team, you can build relationships with your manager and team.

Cons: A lot of disorganization and poor communication with no real motivation to change. Some managers are great - others are terrible, and there doesn’t seem to be any desire for further management training to ensure that this is less hit or miss.
Advice: None
Pros: Large employee network and great female leaders.

Cons: Strict Manager and hectic supervision
Advice: None
Pros: Teamwork,best supervisor and good collegue

Advice: None
Pros: Good hours, benefits, opportunities, and food.

Cons: - Work Environment: Managers here are very involved and enjoy micromanaging. They see overworking as a badge of honor and expect you to do the same. There is now very little flexibility, working hours are absurdly long. About 95% of the site do not have children… and god help you if you do because you will have extra obstacles if you want a promotion, a high visibility project, or in general the flexibility normal salary positions provide. There is very little diversity especially in upper management. Managers are supposed to be supportive and while some managers here do deliver results, they are not leaders. They are supposed to mentor and help you grow… each member of your team is different and that’s what makes it great. But managers here only want a group of yes men and conformity.  Employee satisfaction and morale is down and yet they turn a blind eye and produce an environment where people are scared to speak up because a nail that sticks out gets hammered down here. Your interests as a scientist are not valued and project priorities shift way too often for your interests to be pursued. The few managers that value work/life balance and flexibility have either left or have been overrun. There were fortunate groups with those managers that had the freedom to come/go at whatever time they please as long as their work got done. Some groups were not afforded that “luxury”. Management’s response? Make everyone’s hours long! So if you want to work 8-6, 7-6, or 8-7 or more for 5 days a week on a below market salary then this place is for you. 

Career Movement: There have been times they have “forgotten” to promote people over the years and have done others wrong by intentionally holding them back due to “company needs” (AKA they are having hiring/training issues and can’t get a replacement ready for your position). And since this is an R&amp;D site only, there are no opportunities to make lateral moves into departments like Quality, Regulatory, Manufacturing, etc. Compensation Salary is very mediocre at best especially with the hours that are being worked. Very little was done during the high inflation year.
Advice: Management will not take criticism as they are set on regressing back to our old ways so my advice is to at least provide flexibility in hours, pay more to match the hours worked, and hire more people so they are not as burnt out and can do their best work for the hours they are there. It is most definitely a skeleton crew at the moment.

Lastly, please please please self-reflect… Why is it that you never ask for your teams opinions? Ask how we are doing or if there’s anything you can do to make it better for us? Why is it all take and no give? 

Leaving is so hard and heart breaking but it is no longer bearable. We are passionate and trust worthy employees but we also just want a life outside of work and flexibility. But apparently that is too much to ask for…
Pros: The benefits offered are good

Cons: management is not so good
Advice: None
Pros: salary is up to market

Cons: it is difficult to advance.
Advice: None
Pros: Very stable company, and great science

Cons: toxic coworkers senior management does not have a clear strategy on product launch
Advice: None
Pros: Genia had a free snack room

Cons: Being a huge company, your experience for the same role might vary widely from group to group. Lots of red tape, training etc and as lean as it’s trying to become you inevitably run into a career professional who’s worked the same way for 20 years, is now quite high up and doesn’t want to budge on their positions. But almost every project is on a 5 year plan. Industry works that way, so if you’re looking for a faster pace, not the place to be.

Cons: leadership, cultural change, inconsistent, HR, pay
Advice: None
Pros: People, growth, vision, product quality

Cons: Leadership is not accountable for demonstrating 'Roche values', and is incredibly 'top-down'. Employees are not empowered to make decisions. A lot of back-stabbing, competitiveness, lack of collaborative attitude. Higher leadership choses to be completely blind to these issues. No real commitment to diversity and inclusion- all talk no action.
Advice: None
Pros: Pay, benefits, some people really looking to do good- they generally leave

Cons: Very corporate style of culture
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits for full time

Cons: Been with the company for 4 years now. Pay increases are not matching with cost of living increases. If you want a raise it’s difficult to get unless you change position within the company.
Advice: Work on recognition for those who work hard.
Pros: The work environment is professional, goals are achievable, enough downtime to take care of projects. Medical, vision, and dental benefits are also very good. Somewhat flexible work hours. Reasonable expectation.

Cons: They don't promote their company culture and values
Advice: None
Pros: It has flexible hours and free meals.

Cons: The process is very rigid and often don't focus on innovation

Pros: Great company, purpose and benefits

Cons: None that I could think of
Advice: None
Pros: Would work again tbh it was good.

Cons: Salaries are somewhat low - merits are not in line with inflation. Transform D has ruined the culture throughout the org - people don't feel secure and safe. It no longer feels like people first. 
Layers of leadership have been removed and the remaining leaders have too many direct reports across too many geographies. This has resulted in a focus on fire fighting and less on people development/growth. Leaders are grossly diluted and will burn out eventually.
HR and IT are awful. Everything goes through a Costa Rica call center and it takes days or weeks to get anything done. It is very cumbersome and broken. HR and IT used to be so supportive and localized. This is all gone and more and more functions are moving to a centralized model. It is slowly destroying the organization. I would wait 1-2 years for the dust to settle before joining the organization.
Advice: Leaders should not have more than 10 direct reports. Consider having a business area org structure model. The global centralized models have leaned out the org too much and it is creating hurdles and holding the org back. Go back to People First!
Pros: Excellent benefits, amazing 401k matching, Long Term Incentives for Director and above are great. Fair amount of work-life balance. Company is focused on customer/patient and a diverse workforce.

Cons: Expectation of long hours as not always ample staff to complete work.

Pros: Great company to work for

Cons: None, none, none, none, &amp; none.
Advice: None
Pros: Good, Great, Fantastic, Fun, Enjoyable.

Cons: Benefits could be improved globally, and a recent crackdown on travel related expense.
Advice: Continue to value your employees and relationships with employees. It's this sense of belonging that makes us unique and such a great place to work.
Pros: The people, the flexibility, and the overall mission of the organization.

Cons: The company has a very clickish way of working. If you’re not in, you get shown the door. The company also lets people go while they are out on disability after 17 year of service with no insurance or benefits. Management doesn’t care about their employees.
Advice: Maybe show compassion and consistency in your operations and hire and keep people that actually do their jobs and don’t take credit for other peoples work.

Advice: None
Pros: Excellent benefits, work-life balance, diversity initiatives, work culture, colleagues, innovative ideas, durable and trusted products/brand, etc.

Cons: Manufacturing work, slightly boring. Will pay lower than most other places for similar roles. Occasionally difficult to move departments or groups and promotions not guaranteed.

Cons: Long hours, remote work not allowed (pre-covid)
Advice: None
Pros: Many wonderful memories, great cafeteria and benefits

Cons: Can be difficult to move around to different roles
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, culture, pay and benefits.

Cons: Pay raises below standard, with inflation this year and record profits Roche made, raises across nation are very low and was really discouraging to field workers who have been holding this company up while most haven't left their house in two years. 

Field workers have had to work insane hours and install a ton of instruments so the pay raises to appreciate this would have been nice, given the billions made. We are short staffed greatly already so worried this is going to cause even more Field Engineers to leave now.
Advice: Please review the pay and raises process, compare to other companies. We need to keep our skilled workers, we invest so much in training, its a shame to waste that time. Not to mention the burden it puts on others waiting years to get others trained is rough. We are drowning out here on call volume, we could really use more people.
Pros: Great benefits, great people to work with. State of the art instruments that provide so much for patients.

Advice: None
Pros: the job has a high salary

Cons: Very low salary and not enough promotions.
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture and environment to work.

Cons: Unless you are management and above, you are treated like a doormat, rarely recognized or rewarded for your work, and way underpaid compared to other companies. Also, if you plan to apply for a job at Roche, be prepared for the recruiting/interview process to drag out 2+ months and have to reach out to the recruiter on a weekly basis to get a status update. Absolutely ridiculous for it to take that long.
Advice: None
Pros: The benefits are amazing, unmatched

Cons: Hard to relate to when early in career
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of experience and established culture

Cons: Not much of an opportunity to grow and the compensation is too little

Pros: great culture to work for

Cons: Management is cut throat, not supportive, and only care about how they look to the executive pool. Not inclusive and not willing to listen to differing opinions.
Advice: Reorganize and put people in place that understand what real leadership is. The current people you have in place for many of the departments, do not lead in a way that would reflect well on Roche.
Pros: Most coworkers were great to work with.

Cons: Grow from inside. It is easier to leave and come back!
Advice: None
Pros: This is a great company to work for!

Cons: Management needs to reward highly contributive members much more and provide a good work/life balance. This is not being done nor even discussed among company leaders. Institutional knowledge is not valued enough and should be considered gold.
Advice: Give your top performers a meaningful compensation
Pros: Stratos Genomics was acquired by Roche for our novel DNA sequencing chemistry

Cons: Slow promotion A bit low in pay
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefit Great culture Transparence

Cons: Poor and Unprofessional Management
Low Salary and minimal raises (no COL raises) not in alignment with market standards
Low Visibility and Recognition
Biased division of work/pay
Promotions based on nepotism and not recognition
Large corporate culture
Advice: Management is a result of right place/right time and not necessarily based on management skills or who is best for the position. Visibility is lacking and so is recognition.  Managers have too many direct reports to invest in developing their people, and check ins are not a priority. Promotions and raises are not based on individual accomplishments, but more so on nepotism and minimal standardized raises for "meeting expectations".
Pros: Great Products
Invests in R&amp;D
Great Benefits

Cons: PTO and salary isn't as competitive as other companies
Advice: None
Pros: Great company that truly cares about the patients they serve and the employees

Cons: Depending on your team you may not have much opportunity for advancement within your current role.
Advice: None
Pros: Very employee focused and strives to meet employee needs

Advice: None
Pros: easy flowing, individual work, with emphasis to grow your career.

Cons: Toxic management within the shared service center. 
Annual reviews and merit/bonuses go to those who work the least amount in the department but can talk a good talk.
Managers don’t show appreciation to those who do their jobs or those who go above and beyond. Those who do go above and beyond get compensated less than those who talk about everything they do. (When those people probably work 20 hours a week then add overtime to their time cards)
Advice: Really take a look at who is doing the work on the team. It isn’t always the ones who talk a good game. Actually look at the metrics you pull, the meetings with stakeholders the individual handle, get genuine peer reviews with those who work with the person. Stop playing favorites because someone “looks good and presents themselves well”. If the person who does the best work isn’t the one who presents themself well, teach them. Constantly giving those who don’t deserve opportunities promotions and bonuses doesn’t get the job done.

Advice: None
Pros: Great products with a focus in many biomedical segments. Phenomenal culture.

Cons: The length you are at the company is valued over your level of experience. Their disability program is extremely difficult to navigate. They lowball salaries and extremely underpay contractors, and do not easily negotiate, if at all. It is fairly easy to move positions within roche, but management is frustrating, and there is a clear hierarchy.
Advice: Help your employees more!! Advocate for them!! Step in if you see them struggling! Talk to them and listen to what they say. Don’t be rude or condescending if someone doesn’t know something. Don’t hire or promote people just because they’ve been their for a long time. Don’t tell employees not to discuss salaries or pay, don’t discriminate based on disability and don’t allow other employees to do the same. Step in and correct harmful and sexist behavior, don’t just let people off with a warning. Do better!!!

Cons: difficult promotion process for lab related roles
Advice: None
Pros: Love it here, great benefits

Cons: So far a lot of travel and it takes a long long time to get anything done at Roche. Tools and software are not necessarily being used as intended which leads to hang ups and lower productivity.
Advice: Do away with long term contracts and move to contract-to-hire. There is amazing talent currently on contracts that we are at risk of losing because they need better benefits than what their agencies provide. Consistently extending contracts instead of allowing people to convert means they walk away because they need FTE benefits and find them elsewhere.
Pros: I’ve been at Roche three or four months now and I’ve never been around such a mature organization. For the most part, everyone treats each other calmly and with respect and there is great collaboration between teams. The offices that I have been to inspire collaboration between teams but also the opportunity to work in ways that work best for you (individual meeting rooms, couches, etc)

Cons: I have no cons to work with this company
Advice: None
Pros: excellent pace to work 
Amazing people

Cons: The company has been undergoing a major transformation over the last year, as such nearly half of our experienced people have been let go, left the organization or have moved to new roles. Employees have been jumping ship left, right and center over the last year, creating massive knowledge gaps throughout the organization that have generated a lot of chaos, reactive ways of working and the feeling that the house is on fire. Although the company has gained a tremendous amount of new business, management refuses to grow the headcount accordingly to support these new customers.
Advice: None
Pros: all employees work from home or are field-based

Cons: *Not remote even though everything can be done remotely.

Pros: Great benefits and pretty good pay.
Good work life balance.

Advice: Not everyone wants to move to Indianapolis for more opportunity.
Pros: Benefits are great, inclusion and diversity are great, pay is competitive.

Cons: Due to the size of the organization, the slow decision-making process.
Advice: None
Pros: Working with the greatest scientists and engineers
Highly motivated work environment

Cons: Salary is average or below, depending on your position. Most people who leave the company (especially recently) are easily finding other jobs with 30-40% salary increases, stock options, etc. It's also such a large company promotions are hard to come by so career growth can feel slow.
Advice: If you want to retain the best talent you have to pay for the best talent. Most younger folks don't find the benefits as appealing as having cash in hand.
Pros: The people are amazing, timelines reasonable and benefits are hard to beat (especially the 401k). Not to mention the ethical mindset and mission the company adheres too. Lots of reason to work here.

Cons: I don’t have any at the moment
Advice: None

Cons: Slow moving with progress on projects.
Advice: None
Pros: Good science and good business practices.

Cons: work/life balance is not good
Advice: None
Pros: the pay and the benefits

Cons: Very political organization with people promoted who don't have subject matter expertise. People take credit for your work and shut you out of opportunities to help their own advancement.
Advice: Recognize that long tenure and titles don't equate to being qualified for a job.  Reach out more to employees and listen to their input.
Pros: Great benefits, on-site cafeteria and fitness facilities and health clinic.

Cons: Some individuals are not allowed to move around/up in order to make the business move forward. However, others are allowed to move frequently to new positions.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and great colleagues!

Cons: The work load sometimes gets a little tough to handle. You are stretched thin sometimes and required to keep your documents up to date at all times. This gets in the way of doing more "value-added" work
Advice: None
Pros: This team has an amazing team culture. COVID did not impact our team at all. If anything, WFH made us stronger as a team. Everyone is SUPER nice and very supportive. Everyday looks really different so you are never bored.

Cons: Working 7 days a week poor management
Advice: Hire better planners treat and pay employees better hourly not just Bonuses
Pros: Pay bonuses hours food cafeteria air

Cons: Passionate decentralization leads to a siloed, divisional environment where toxic leaders can thrive,
Advice: None
Pros: Purpose, Compensation, Benefits, Company Reputation, Culture

Cons: The culture changed, in my opinion, with the new CEO in North America. They used to be focused on customer first and attracting and retaining the best and most talented employees. In my experience they have become more bottom line driven, evidenced by layoffs after a phenomenal growth year. I know many top tier employees that were let go, with no effort by Roche to retain them. These layoffs also left many key customers without ideal support. In other words, what they say and what they do are two different things.
Advice: None
Pros: Roche has great benefits, very high quality products and excellent training programs.

Cons: Employees are expendable. Promotions rarely given to qualified employees
Advice: Leadership is out of touch

Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits and flexible work environment.

Cons: Good at talking, bad at taking quick action.

Too many management levels, high managers have been away from hands on research for too long and lost all the sensitivity on details.
Advice: None
Pros: Abundant resource, good life work balance, decent benefit

Cons: Restructuring too quickly and promotions are sometimes questionable
Advice: None
Pros: The people and the company perks/benefits

Cons: Values the time spent at the company more than your work contributions when considering promotions. Lower than market value pay.
Advice: None
Pros: Really great work life balance

Cons: the culture at the US Diagnostics HQ in Pleasanton was toxic and not inclusive
'top-heavy' company-- people tend to stay and that can contribute to the limited rate of personal career growth
Advice: the US Diagnostics HQ in Pleasanton had a lot of middle management that provided poor leadership.  the company should closely examine the qualification, management style, and communication ability of its managers.
Pros: great benefits (including if and when there is a lay-off)
long-term stability
nice campuses

Cons: Low work/life balance compared to other business units
Advice: None
Pros: Portfolio has improved over previous years

Cons: Progress on projects can be slow. Large company processes take time.
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay and benefits; smart workforce

Cons: Abysmal manufacturing. Meager second level support. Too many assigned instruments - not enough staff. High turnover. All departments dump their responsibilities on field employees. Corporate gears turn too slowly to make impactfull change.
Advice: All departments should be held to the meaningless propaganda you tout as corporate values if you want your front line employees to toe that line. Even tho service is a financial liability to the company, you shouldn't treat your field service employees individually as a liability.
Pros: Guaranteed 40 hours of pay. Unmatched benefits

Cons: Trying to advance out of call center
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is flexible and benefits are great. Good atmosphere and people.

Cons: Work/Life balance is slanted to work, need to increase workforce to keep up with exponential growth
Advice: High employees to keep pace with exponential growth.  Roche leads market in IVD and support.
Pros: Great culture, beliefs and IVD leader

Cons: Can be challenging at times. Global company, so role may require early meetings
Advice: None
Pros: Love the people, the benefits, and the work.

Cons: Large company with a corporate culture might not be the working environment for everyone.
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of options for career development. Good pay and benefits.

Cons: Lack of accountability from the team
Advice: None
Pros: Exciting good work, Good benefits

Cons: MICROMANAGED to the point where you have to ask for permission to use the bathroom. If you enjoyed the worst parts of high school then this is the place for you!! You don’t care about your well being at all. They belittle people and make you feel insignificant. Management is a joke, they don’t know what they’re doing or how to talk to people. Worst place I have ever worked for. I suggest you run for the hills because it’s only getting worst.
Advice: Stop micromanaging. When you ask for feedback on how to improve you should learn to actively listen to your employees. When selecting a manager focus on someone that can speak properly to their team, not someone who only bosses them around.
Pros: Everyone said the benefits were great but I don’t think their benefits package justified them treating you like a high schooler.

Cons: Micromanage work environment and a high turn over rate
Advice: None
Pros: Excellent work-life balance with top-notch benefits. The management team really seems to care about their employees. You may have to work late/from home sometimes when the company needs you to, but that is balanced with the ability to work from home when YOU need to; its a fair trade

Cons: Roche is really a good company; thus, I don't have any cons for it.
Advice: None
Pros: Roche is a great company that take good care of their employees.

Cons: beware of cliques in upper management
Advice: None
Pros: great benefits for FT workers

Cons: Contractors receiving a lot less of the perks and benefits than regular employees
Advice: None
Pros: - Awesome work environment and culture
- Employee appreciation events and programs
- Working for a company that helps people worldwide
- Beautiful campus
etc.

Cons: By far the biggest drawback is the toxic work culture and weak management.  There are a number of managers who do not have their employees' back, leaving them to fend for themselves until they either become toxic themselves as a survival mechanism, or leave the company in time so that self-healing can begin.

Politics is par for the course - yet it is the intensity level that takes it to a whole new dimension.  Power grabs, empire building, scapegoating, and undermining other teams are openly on display without appropriate action (and sometimes not even a reaction) from local management.  The one transgression not on display, by virtue of its definition, is backstabbing (which also happens quite often). 

There are some that complain about too many processes.  This is not a start-up anymore.  There is a lack of the right kind of processes that can propel an organization to efficiently reach its business goals.  Removing the brakes so that one team can work faster without fully appreciating the impacts on other teams results in a longer time to reach the organization's business objectives.

The Molecular Solutions cultural values plastered on the walls are mostly viewed as wall art as local management often do not practice via leading by example.
Advice: Deal with toxic employees and weak managers who tolerate such behavior before it spreads even further.
Pros: It is pretty amazing to work with an organization consisting of multidisciplinary talent.  Work life balance and benefits are pretty good.  Compensation is average.  Facilities are managed quite well.  Free snacks are available though that may change once the new cafeteria is ready.

Pros: Overall a pretty good company....

Cons: Constant changes in all parts of the organization.  The company is too big and heavy - present a challenge from speed and efficiency perspectives.
Advice: PT, PD, GPS, etc. these are all artificial boundaries we implemented. We talk about speed to patients - have you really look at how fast (or not) we could move?

Advice: None
Pros: Stable
Good benefit
Good culture
Customer focus
A lots of perk

Cons: - Lack of coherent strategy. There seems to be little intentionality and executive leadership in Sequencing that affects all levels. 
- Decision-making processes are extremely slow and inefficient. I would describe it as a Kafkaesque nightmare. Documentation and meetings are mistaken for actual work.
- A few extremely rude apples ruined the barrel. A senior technical lead once started a meeting with "Show of hands for who thinks ____ is stupid?", a contractor once posted publicly on LinkedIn asking how to decrease the influence of my role, a scientist at the VP level chastised me after thinking that I gave one of his reports constructive feedback (I hadn't, and the feedback was valid). A colleague thought it was normal to go to her car and cry after work meetings. This was an extremely unhealthy work culture, and I still get angry just thinking about many of the interactions I had. 
- Absolute lack of knowledge about software and software development processes.
Advice: - Understand the problems we're trying to solve for our customers and the people they serve (the patients). Don't miss the forest for the trees by focusing so much on useless processes.
- Hire people with empathy. This is a healthcare company after all.
- If you want to build software products, hire people with experience in software development (not just software quality) and empower them to drive change in the organization.
Pros: - Overall mission to "Do now what patients need next" is inspiring.
- "Work/life balance" is so good that I would describe working here as early retirement.

Cons: "We specialize in everything." - Good diversification, but ambiguous priorities.
Advice: None
Pros: Positive, collaborative working environment, great culture, real science.

Cons: Low pay and too much politics
Advice: Be transparent
Pros: This can be fun but boring. Depends on your team

Cons: Constant structural change and politics
Advice: None
Pros: Passionate team, good work environment, good pay and benefits

Cons: - Difficult management
- Too political unless you are in the right cliques
Advice: Further develop a culture which actually aligns with core values. Reward hard work and innovation rather than rewarding "yes-man" management who are harmful or demotivating to staff.
Pros: - Learn a lot
- Good science
- Strict quality and compliance

Cons: None so far. Hopefully stays that way
Advice: None
Pros: Decent benefits and good working conditions

Cons: Slow to adapt to market
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, knowledgeable team, fun

Cons: the work life balance is fine
Advice: None
Pros: I do not have anything to say right now

Cons: Tougher to escalate career due to politics
Advice: None
Pros: Stable company. Great Benefits included

Cons: Can be too laissez-faire at times.
Advice: Accountability
Pros: Great people and company culture! The resources and benefits are spectacular. A great place to work.

Cons: Work/life balance can be questionable, depending on your manager.  Too many directors and VP's means that the company is too top-heavy and not enough focus is on what is actually going on.  Quality is spouted as something very important, but it is frequently sacrificed for profit.  There are no career opportunities for hard working employees, though if you are willing to dive into the politics and social aspects of the company, you can move up quickly, regardless of your qualifications.  The cultural beliefs are something else that are propped up as important, but again, if you actually practice them, you get nowhere, especially if you bring up anything negative (such as potential issues).  Finally, there are certain members of HR that seem to have it out for certain employees.  Instead of being fair, they are totally and completely biased and they are never wrong in their own eyes.  If you get on their bad side, you will not be treated well at the company and you will not get the promotions you deserve.
Advice: This is more to Mara:  get rid of the bad seeds in both management and HR.  All they are doing is hurting the company more and more each day and pushing away the best employees.  Actually focus on quality instead of just saying it.  Our customers can tell the difference and when they start leaving, it will not matter how much product is produced.
Pros: Decent pay for Tucson, where there are not many large employers.  Benefits are actually pretty good.

Cons: Along with the tremendous mass of those who are welcoming, there are some select individuals that I have encountered that are not, but these are few and far between within the company.  Contracted employees be advised, I am currently one and will not be hired on permanently because there is no room in my department.  They will contract and anticipate room will open up, but it will not always do so.  Do not let this deter you, but if you are contracted, be sure to have a backup plan just in case.
Advice: None
Pros: I remember my first day on campus, and the atmosphere was just so completely welcoming.  People I had never even met would just walk up to say hi, and it was nice to feel so much like I belong from the first time I walked through the door.  Honestly, that is really how it has been the entire time that I have been with Ventana.  They manufacture top quality diagnostics products that people can believe in, and that are helping to save lives every day.  The most rewarding part of the job is during the all-employee meetings, Dr. Grogan presents the employees with a case study on a patient where Ventana products have helped to save their life with a focus on personalized medicine.  It is very enlightening, and it definitely lets you know that you are making a difference in the lives of all patients afflicted with cancer, regardless of your role.  Benefits are amazing, and there is a ton of opportunity throughout Ventana and the rest of the Roche community.

Cons: Similar challenges with all the matrix organization
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, high talented people and value people's creativity

Cons: I cannot think of any

Pros: It is a stable company with many well-known products

Advice: None
Pros: Competitive salary, work-life balance and benefits

Cons: Lots of meetings and sometimes do not relate.
Advice: None
Pros: Open work space and a lot of benefits

Cons: Depending on which department you have you could have either a great experience of a rough one. Also there is clearly a bias forwards the European portion of the company. Most resources are going there.
Advice: Treat your employees better!
Pros: Good benefits, work-life balance. Etc

Cons: Large slow moving company that is sometimes slow to change
Advice: None
Pros: Good job, wonderful colleagues, supportive policies

Cons: There was no face to face training. It was fine, just different. The parent company treated us like second class citizens. But if you were lucky enough to be paired up with some good parent company counterparts, the experience was great. 

The health insurance was just ok. But at least we had health insurance. 

Like a lot of PDI contracts we had to use our own cars and the reimbursement was not that great. 

The biggest con was we were not hired on to be full-time reps. We worked on a contract for over two years  really getting the word out to the HCPs and the company didn't think we were good enough to be part of their actual organization. If they thought there was a big problem, they should have fixed, retrained, and addressed that issue with the currents reps they had. We were very dedicated to moving their sales forward and in the end it was a slap in the face.  Of course, there will always be reps that take advantage of the situation. But as a first time contract worker, I still took my sales and job just as seriously as I did when I was a direct hire.
Advice: Value the employees that are dedicated to moving your business forward, contract sales force or direct hires.
Pros: Great manager, very helpful recuiter, trainer was very nice. 

My counterpart that worked for the company contracting us was really great. I was lucky to have a good partner. We had the same goal, make sales. She was very supportive,

Cons: Beware of the cafeteria, it has an amazing chef like taken out of a fairy tale and very affordable gourmet food; you might end up packing some extra pounds. To mitigate this, make sure to go to the fitness center nearby.
Advice: I'll just use this space to once again express my dearest gratitude to RMD!
Pros: -Specialized mentoring, you even get to choose your mentor and he/she will be a company director.
-Lots of exposure to IVD industry milestone accomplishment, you will experience what happens within a company when this kind of events occur.
-Your involvement within your internship project will have freedom to a degree that will allow you to personalize your contributions with your own creativity and intelligent initiatives. 
-People are really nice and have an amazing sense of humor, most seniors are friends among each other and that creates an awesome collaborative environment. 
-You'll have the time of your life!

Cons: No idea what global grading, salary band, or how progression look like
Advice: None
Pros: Pretty okay company to work at

Cons: Challenges dealing with evolving old management models into new faster paced models.
Advice: None
Pros: Very driven to go into the faster world of data-driven development.

Cons: The management was not the best.
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits were the best thing about the company.

Cons: at the time they did not pay well at all. went to a competitor and got a 35% pay increase plus bonus.
Advice: None
Pros: the people and travel were great.

Cons: none, big company but that is ok
Advice: None
Pros: Good leadership, good products, great work life balance

Cons: Execs wanting to fix what's "not broken", upper management silos in similar divisions in different countries, rare promotions in certain divisions/locations that can affect morale
Advice: Regular re-orgs are not always necessary, keep the Roche collegiate culture alive (it is very uplifting)
Pros: Collegiate atmosphere, competitive salary, great benefits, work life balance, growth opportunities

Advice: None
Pros: GREAT ATMOSPHERE, and awesome managers

Advice: None
Pros: culture, teamwork, expansion, hybrid work from home

Cons: None I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Leader in the industry.Reliable products.

Cons: Maybe could invest more time into an organized training system for new employees. Pay could be a bit higher compared to competitors.
Advice: None
Pros: Creative people, supportive management, good system in place for mentorship for future preparation for higher level roles.

Cons: Cannot think if any cons
Advice: No advice to be given at this time.
Pros: Collaborative, Challenging, Teamwork, Flexible and Fulfilling

Cons: However, it is deteriorating consistently for 2 years now and there is no end in sight. 9/80 option was eliminated and there's no intention to bring it back. Budget constraints are getting worse and worse as the company is fighting legacy problems. Research is taking a step back, product development is now done with external "partners" instead of in-house, software development has long been out-sourced and the trend is being continued. There's really no engineering work left that's worth doing and the future for that type of work looks bleak. Roche doesn't seem to mind that highly qualified and high-salaried engineers sit around and create documents and presentations all day as they keep on funding this travesty but if you are a motivated engineer who wants to expand your knowledge and learn new things in your field,  then stay away. 
The Culture is toxic in some departments. Senior managers that care only about themselves and actively keep their employees from growing so they can control them and make sure they won't be a threat to them. Lots of talk about values and opportunity but it feels like empty promises when it is not actively lived.
Advice: There are almost more Chiefs than Indians now. I hope you see what's wrong with that.
Pros: This used to be a wonderful company. Lots of perks, great retirement contribution by the company, highly skilled and motivated people and a great mission. Bonus programs and decent pay.

Cons: You will work an excess amount of overtime.
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work, plenty of opportunities.

flexible work environment

Cons: Processes, European culture on a lot of teams
Advice: None
Pros: Good pay, great community, interesting projects, worthwhile work to improve the lives of patients, easy to move parallelly

Cons: Salary, Racist, &amp; Unfair management.
Advice: Packaging management are incompetent, racist, unfair. They literally treat workers and look down upon them.  White  Leads and Supervisors need some cultural and sensitivity training.
Pros: Just the company health benefits.

Cons: Lack of strategy, ever changing priorities.
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits (e.g. 401k matching) are ok.

Cons: i dont see any cons
Advice: nothing to say
Pros: money lots of money for me

Cons: Very odd performance review system and, in my experience, inconsistent. Performance is rated on a curve, with an expected number to fall below "meets expectations".  Management follows that curve so that a small handful of employees who may have met every expectation throughout the year were assigned below average rating to meet the Roche standard.  Also, I have seen a "partially meets expectations" on the compensation review, yet no rating at all entered into the internal HR Portal.  Unclear career path for many non-exempt positions
Advice: 1) An employee should never receive a less than "meets expectations" rating because of a corporate statistic unless he or she fell short of goals established.   I have sat in on review meetings and watched this very unfair process unfold and the managers argued over who to give a lower rating to.  Borderline unethical business practice. p.s. for my own review, all that was discussed were shortcomings with NO acknowledgement of achievements. Who does that???
2) Would recommend the company consider increasing the annual allotment for Tuition Reimbursement, currently capped at $10,000 per year. 
3) Standardize job titles and pay scales throughout the organization, all locations; advantages for training and growth opportunities not provided to equivalent employees at all business units.
4) Offer mandatory training for all management with a set of standard guidelines for LEADING.
Pros: Benefits are excellent, plenty of flexibility in the work schedule and fosters a team environment. Pay is ok, average.  Very good fit with colleagues, more than adequate management communication globally and locally. Global initiatives are met with positive responses from all employees.

Cons: Upper management can change the role for better or worse and either way it will be static for a few years.
Advice: Network and build advocates
Pros: Dynamic work experience that is always changing and challenging. New opportunities are always close at hand.

Cons: Lots of reorgs.  Seems to happen every 2 years.
Advice: None
Pros: Currently a good team and good manager

Cons: Roche has completely changed its culture over the last 10 years from being "family like" oriented; looking out for one another; helping each other; and happy for the success of not only the company but fellow co-workers to one of: 
backstabbing at every turn; 
massive CYA on every project or assignment; 
no decision making because of fear of losing your job; 
an environment of making it necessary to be "one of the good ole boys/girls" (i.e. exceptional work no longer gets you promoted...now it is ONLY who you know higher up and how much have you kissed that person 's rear); 
HUGE HR discipline issues...they HAVE to blame someone so make sure you do what everyone else does and massively CYA (you will be disciplined for things that you didn't even do...I was given a written warning and documented counseling for the failure of a project that I and 12 others were assigned to complete over the course of 12 months, and the part that needed my assistance was at the end (still 6 months away from being discussed)...I was not even invited to the initial meetings because they didn't need me, but it became a total guilt by association).
Advice: They won't listen so it's pointless to add anything here.
Pros: Pay is decent as are health benefits; good 401k matching program; many departments allow work from home a few days during the week.

Cons: Working at Ventana in Regulatory Affairs, you will frequently be abused by bosses who are only there because they are married to someone else who is more important. Some will be very good friends with someone who is more important.

Managers and senior managers can come on board with no experience. Directors may have 0-3 years of experience. The politics are very thick, and not even close to fair. Being competent in this department is a severe handicap because that makes you a threat.

The girlfriend of the married boss may never come to work, and her job may be dumped on your lap at the last minute. Your "superior" coworker may spend all her time working for her contract clients instead of your shared employer, and all her train wrecks may be dumped in your lap. You may be treated as a slave by a boss with dyslexia who searches for typos in your work, can't teach you anything, takes credit for your work, and doesn't know how to lead. None of these people will ever cooperate with you by sharing necessary information or even telling the truth. They actually want you to fail at doing their jobs for them.

If you have to take a job in this department, then just keep looking. I do not recommend relocating.
Advice: Apply for a non-management position.  You don't know what you're doing.
Pros: The pay and benefits are good.  There is usually hardly any work to do.

Cons: organizational changes and change of management very frequent
Advice: None
Pros: good benefits, learning environment, nice location

Cons: toxic bosses make it difficult to want to stay
Advice: None
Pros: excellent opportunities to learn and grow

Cons: New employment model has reduced employee numbers
Advice: None
Pros: Challenging work, great products, innovative and R&amp;D driven

Cons: - Very risk-averse, to the point where project implementation is difficult and can drag on for months.  Too much red tape and documentation are required to get any project off the ground. 
- The trade-off for the great benefits is that salaries can be 10K lower than what you'd find elsewhere for a similar job title/role.
- Success within your career path depends mostly on who you know and how well you fit with your direct manager's personal focus and leadership style.  Employees who are stuck in a rut career-wise can become "unstuck" by moving to a different department/manager. 
- Managers spend too much time in meetings and travelling
Advice: - Find ways to streamline project development and implementation, including cutting down on needless, unhelpful documentation and layers of bureaucracy.
- Cut down on meetings and travel for managers.  
- Encourage managers to sit with employees once a month and understand the day-to-day work.
Pros: - Respect for employees' work/life balance.  Salaried employees have some flexibility in work hours.  Most managers are willing to work with you on this, as long as you're a reliable employee with no performance issues.
- Excellent vacation and health benefits (includes dental, vision, prescription, retirement savings/401k)
- Friendly and respectful work atmosphere
- Plenty of learning and career development opportunities (includes tuition reimbursement)
- Employee appreciation events and activities are very nice and well-organized - company not afraid to spend money to reward employees for hard work
- Good on-site cafeterias/food service
- Challenging work - very bright colleagues who will push and inspire you to do your best.

Cons: - Admittedly, the culture that this company loves to talk up is sometimes cringeworthy.
- Realistically, there is very little chance, particularly with the recent hiring surge followed by a hiring freeze, that you will be able to move up within the organization. This is usually the case with most companies anymore, but for a company that preaches the personal development of its employees, it is hypocritical.
- Management is not connected with the employees within the labs. They make decisions at times that are to the active detriment of such employees. I will say that normally management is fine, but they have made some decisions that have left me scratching my head to an extent.
Advice: Please connect more with the employees that occupy the groups you oversee. Do more to realize what they actually struggle with, and don't make knee-jerk decisions that in reality aren't helping or even actively hurting. Also promote more from within. You spend so much to educate and train these professionals in your labs.
Pros: - This is a great company to cut one's teeth at if you're a recent graduate. If you're able to make it to Direct-hire status the pay and benefits can be extremely favorable.
- Speaking of benefits, one major thing you can use those benefits for is to further your education if you so desire. They have a very generous tuition assistance program.
- Just about everyone here is genuinely friendly, and more than willing to help out your group with something should the need arise.

Cons: Sometimes Siloed
Hard to latter up what your working on
Advice: None
Pros: Great people
Room to advance
Multi product

Cons: Slow a bit as it is super big
Advice: None
Pros: Friendly environment to learn and adapt

Cons: there are a lot of departments. it could be challenge to navigate for new hires
Advice: None
Pros: great benefit such as 401k, paid holidays

Cons: The Genentech buy out will close my site in Palo Alto.  But worse than that, our pipeline is completely inverted, and has been for 5 years.  We have more phase 3 and 4's than we have new molecules.  That is very costly, and the highest levels of management have not let good molecules go forward due to lack of funds.  This will kill the company before 2015.
Advice: be careful what you wish for.  if you manage to cut your costs and people too much, you will no longer be attractive as a pharma partner because you will be unable to meet delivery timelines.  And let's face it, in licensed products make up a big chunk of your pipeline.  

outsourcing is not the answer you think it is.
Pros: The location is great, and the people are great.  The last few years there has been an effort to grow organically, and hire new young talent.  There used to be a pension, but they discontinued it for new hires.  It is one of the biggest pharma companies out there, and they are partnering with many small biotechs to bring exciting new medicines to market.  Unfortunately, all of the compounds discovered at Roche (that are not from Basel) get killed the slow death from lack of support, delays and fear of the unknown.  There are very few people left in big pharma who actually know what it takes to get drugs on the market.

Cons: - Reorganization happens on a seemingly annual basis - managers and directors get shuffled around to different business units, while individual contributors get laid off (although severance packages are generous)
- Promotions can be difficult to obtain, at least at the individual contributor/lower management level.  At the same time, remaining in the same position for longer than a few years is a bad idea, as it can give the impression that you aren't interested in taking on new challenges and potentially target you for the next round of layoffs.  You must aggressively seek out your own career development and network with the right people within the company, in order to move ahead.
- Innovation and creativity can be stifled by layers of regulatory, quality and security control
Advice: Your commitment to employees and being a good corporate citizen is appreciated.  However, the continual restructuring and shifts in focus contribute to an overall perception that leadership is reactive rather than proactive, and disconnected from actual day-to-day work done by lower-level employees and managers.  Consider seeking detailed input from those on the "front lines" as you look to make decisions in the future.
Pros: - Company shows integrity and has a strong commitment to employees and the community
- Good pay and outstanding benefits - it would be hard to find a company that could match or exceed what Roche offers
- Employees receive frequent perks and special appreciation events
- Large company, many potential career paths available
- Pleasant working environment

Cons: No cons that I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, care about their employees

Cons: Challenging hours, can be tedious
Advice: None
Pros: Interesting work, friendly, variety of projects

Cons: Compensation has been declining over the years. Benefits are good, but salaries are low and upper management seems reluctant to keep their pay rates competitive with anything but the lowest of industry estimates. Vertical movement is difficult to achieve. Contract/temp workers are not paid competitively and are 'forced' into cut-rate benefits policies from Roche's choice of staffing firms. Management ignores the contract workers and seems hesitant to provide any kind of advancement opportunities. Some temps have been here 8 YEARS doing consistently great work but are overlooked for permanent positions.
Advice: Roche's benefits program used to make up for it's low rate of pay but this is not the case anymore. Management needs to put some serious thought into restructuring their current compensation plans to keep them competitive. Treat temp workers better; many of them are fantastic employees but are passed over for external hires. If you are going to cultivate talent, then encourage and utilize it instead of diminishing it.
Pros: Working at Roche is like being part of a family. People look out for each other and act in a manner that is friendly and professional. This company is great to start out with, has amazing opportunities for those who are willing to diversify their skill set, and is an overall joy to work for. Management works with their employees and aims to take care of their own.

Cons: management so cocky at times. Mainly white men.
Advice: None
Pros: Income, territory structure, benefits and training

Cons: Too much bureaucracy, needlessly complex business processes and excessive risk aversion hurt both the company and employees.  Frequent changes in organizational strategies in some divisions, which usually lead to layoffs.  Some areas can be highly political.  Despite all the resources the company puts into career development, moving into a new position is difficult, especially if outside one's own department.  Hiring managers often have unrealistic expectations about the level of specific experience required to perform a job.  Some jobs, particularly in IT, have surprisingly low salary ranges.
Advice: Continue to value employees and seek diversity and inclusion.  Work to simplify business processes and take reasonable risks to keep company agile and foster innovation.  Empower employees with decision-making power at the lowest possible hierarchy level.  Review salary ranges and barriers to career movement; emphasize the value of transferable skills and experience.
Pros: Company is highly respected and a good corporate citizen.  Comprehensive benefits package is top of the line, particularly the medical benefits.  Opportunity to work with very bright and highly motivated colleagues.  Good work-life balance, if you are fortunate enough to land on the right team, with the right manager.  Despite a rather conservative company culture, Roche is taking steps in the right direction toward diversity and inclusiveness.  Employees are treated respectfully, and provided with special events and other perks to maintain team/department cohesiveness and morale.  The campus and buildings are beautiful.

Cons: Large company sometimes difficult to navigate internal assistance
Advice: None
Pros: Fair company and good work life balance

Cons: According to bay area standards Roche doesn't pay much
Advice: None
Pros: work life balance, great culture.

Cons: While working there, I saw that the team selling approach was not effective. It's no longer in place. Claims of being "family friendly" and giving employees a "work/life" balance were never put into practice.  HR department not responsive and more concerned with protecting the company interests than a focus on "human resources", and treating employees as such.  Policies were not applied across the board.  Behind the times in expense reporting, CRM databases and CBT, which resulted in inefficiencies.  Training of sales reps lacking in substance.
Advice: Begin truly listening to your employees.  Be consistent.  Practice what you preach.  Ask and answer the tough questions.  What does "family friendly" really mean?  What is a "work/life" balance?  Make your expectations, or definitions of those new "catch phrases" clear to every employee.  Then be willing to listen to feedback objectively.  Consider being a maverick and take a hard look at your HR department.  Perhaps everyone is better served when there is one department looking out for the company and one that is there for employees, and views them as resources.
Pros: Pay and benefits.  Multiple opportunities to stay within the Diagnostics division, in the field as a sales representative.  Incentives for field employees to move to Indianapolis and take other positions in Training, Marketing and other key departments.  Typically paid an average of their sales salary, including bonuses, incentives and commissions, for the first 3? years.

Cons: There really are no cons
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits and pay. Opportunity for advancement.

Cons: Pay, politics and low room for advancement
Advice: None

Cons: Unexpected good decision in the Roche
Advice: None
Pros: It is very nice company

Cons: Long product life cycles 
Products can be ended easily if not prioritized
Advice: None
Pros: Global company with lots of opportunities 
Focus on site culture
Great benefits

Cons: There really are no cons
Advice: None
Pros: Pay, benefits, training, colleagues, management

Cons: Not very stable in the US.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company with good benefits

Cons: People change roles constantly, instability.
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits, great culture. Recommend

Cons: Can get very fast paced and stressful from time to time, when needing to meet quick timelines, but not a con if you thrive off an environment like that. Which I enjoy, in healthy doses. 

Site could use some upgrading in terms of technology and office layout/decor. Daily use Tech tools are old and inefficient, floors and wall decor is dated. Both do not accurately project the cutting edge scientific products the company takes such pride in producing.
Advice: None
Pros: Great opportunity to gain experience in vast areas of the company: scientific, managerial, project management, six sigma, financial, etc. If you have the interest, you can gain the skill at Roche. 

Also supporters of continual education, providing financial support for continuing educational interests in any area of the business in pursuit or a degree or certificate/certification. 

Constructive work environment focused on mentoring/coaching. Culture is competitive but without being cut throat. 

Gratifying, even if you had a hard or tough day, you go home knowing you had a part in producing product(s) that touch the lives of so many patients and their families.

Cons: The same job forever. Very difficult to move because no preference is given to the internal candidates. Promotions are only in R&amp;D, the rest of organization does not see any. Each time they post position - they bring a pool of external candidates. Managers do not promote their employees unless you are in R&amp;D. I have seen people stuck for 10 years not being able to move even though the company is huge.
Advice: The employee turnover is still high. It does not help with product quality issues, morale, and employee motivation. What are you doing to retain, motivate, and keep your existing employees? Before bringing new ones, take good care of what you have if you want to make quality products and ultimately compete with other biotech companies.
Pros: Good pay (one of the highest you can find), awesome benefits (one of the best and the most comprehensive you can find), good work life balance (not the best because working from home is not allowed often). Tuition reimbursement 100% (limited to the number of classes you take per year).

Cons: So many CEOs in the last few years you lose count
No consistency, long-term strategy or vision b/c of constant turnover at the top. The 2 senior executives who survived &gt;20 years probably should be gone-they exist to maintain the status quo
Need innovation in products to compete globally--and fix potential LT problems with lingering FDA issues
The "Old Boys" rule this place and it seems very accepted. Women are barely tolerated and 2 minority men in senior mgmt is the company's claim to diversity and no one seems to see that as a problem.
Advice: Coordinate with Germany to correct product complaints or it could hurt at the worse time and hit profits hard. Don't let long-term employees run away newer employees with new ideas and willingness to innovate. Actually work on improving relationships with employees by having managers go out into the field or onto the floor and learn about employees challenges and how they would "fix" their jobs.
Pros: Co-workers are passionate about the customers we serve
Flexibility depending on your job or department
Opportunities to travel internationally and to relocate globally
Well-repsected within the community

Cons: Having spent more than two decades at this company I can assure you that (with very few exceptions) managers are trained by boss expectations to manage upward. Their employees are valued for what they can produce to make the manager look good and nothing else.  

The company attempts to portray itself as a benevolent organization where each employee cares as much for their customer as for profit or individual advancement.  Actually, shareholders, executives and the C Suite think short term profit above all else unless forced to by govt pressure.  The company is extraordinarily risk averse.

Every 2 or 3 years they introduce a new "philosophy" or cultural change that "will improve employees' and/or customer's lives". These changes are implemented from the bottom up, top management/executives are exempt. i.e. destined to fade into oblivion.
Advice: None
Pros: The average employee is fantastic. When you find a great manager, they are a pleasure to work for.  There are opportunities to grow one's career around the world.

Cons: There were rivalries between worksites sites, favoritism, and politics were prevalent.  While there were opportunities to learn new things, the group structure was calcified and younger folks couldn't really hope to advance until older folks quit or retired.  I always had the impression that Sr. management was out of touch, and maybe didn't really understand what my group did.
Advice: Sr. management has changed since I left, so I'm not sure how relevant my advice would be.
Pros: Roche was the place where I learned how to be a professional.  I loved the people I worked with on a daily basis, as well as the friendly and supportive atmosphere.  I had great opportunities to learn and grow there, and people are still impressed when they hear that I worked at Roche.  My supervisor taught me a great deal, as did my coworkers.  Roche values mentoring very highly, which is wonderful.  Mentoring inspires great working relationships and helps both the mentor and the protege learn new things and stay current.

Cons: Process, process, process... like any big Pharma, too many processes, and very rigid, hurt innovation. Way too many governance committees make getting something approved a painful process. And a waste of time. But if you are organized, and can accept this over-governance issue, Roche is a great place to work.
Advice: Simplify governance. Governance committees have become a turf war where all alpha males speak loud and it's a waste of time to really good scientists. Roche is a great company to work for and you are making it very difficult to innovate. Simplify decision making, simplify processes.
Pros: I worked at Roche in 2012-2016, at the site in NY. Excellent company to work for. Great benefits, good salary, great environment, fantastic perks (often free food, celebrations, a very inexpensive cafe with food/drinks, attendance to sport and shows, etc). Great resources, interactive, and fantastic science. I loved my colleagues, the site, the company, both Roche and Genentech, and I recommend it to anybody looking for a good job, with excellent science, people, benefits and salary.

Cons: The company identity in the US is confused and seems to be changing into Genentech, but not quite.
Most management, at even the highest levels, seems lost at times. 
The Nutley NJ site seems to be destined for continued down sizing and really should be put out of its misery. The medicinal chemistry dept. that brought Valium to market has been turned into a “World Class” joke. This is partly due to new incompetent management who sought guidance from incompetent and narcissistic “retired” management who rose to that level through the attrition of truly talented people.
Unfortunately this seems to have become standard practice.
Advice: Hoffmann-LaRoche was an excellent company and needs to be revitalized, not transformed into Genentech. 
Close the Nutley site completely. It is and will be just an embarrassment.
New leadership is desperately needed and failed “retired” managers should not be kept around and constantly consulted.
Finally, settle on a research structure and strategy, fully implement it, and then give it a chance to work.
Pros: Some good people, some good benefits and a severance package when you get layed-off.
There are opportunities to be put in a position that no other company would even consider you for, particularly if you are a sycophant.

Cons: Outsourced work,  removal of employee benefits, no new work, no transparency, no career growth
Advice: Stop saying you want something (like employee retention) then doing nothing to make that happen (not listening to what employees want.)  Don't take away the things that made it a great place to work.  Bring back new and exciting development in country instead of hiring 70 Romanian engineers to do the work.  Most engineers want to work on tech and not manage a bunch of others.  Have a plan laid out and follow it for future development.  Make sure people can grow and get promoted in their careers and not just the ones who seem to be in with leadership.  Too many meetings happen where there are a bunch of great ideas and nothing is actually executed based on those ideas.  Stop the management carousel where leadership is replaced every year and a re-org happens.
Pros: Interesting work,  Mostly good benefits, Beautiful work location,  good coworkers at the development level

Cons: The highest level of the organization can not be trusted.   Reorganizations are endless and have been occuring for several years.  Hundreds of people have lost their jobs without ever knowing the real reasons why.  Many people throughout the Roche Divisions live in constant fear of losing their jobs. 

When an individual is  "re-orged" out, HR will put notes in the employee file such as "not eligible for rehire" - even if the employee was in good standing at the time of the "re-org".   In some cases, particularly brutal managers will destroy a person mentally first in hopes that they will quit first - especially if the individual might be up for a severance package if they were to stay and get "re-orged" out instead.  

 Individuals in the sales organization have it the toughest.  They are the scapegoats for all the Company's woes.

A root cause of the ruthlessness is the declining business in several of the Divisions and overall inability of the organization to meet profit margins year after year.
Advice: Get a soul
Pros: There are good training programs and good benefits.  There are very nice people in Indianapolis.

Cons: The Company is currently transitioning to a new operating model.
Advice: Give all employees an chance to advocate for future positions.
Pros: The company has Good benefits.

Cons: The diagnostics division is not generally considered revenue generating, and as such all things are seen in that light.  You can only do as good a breaking even so most successes seem muted.  The is little room for advancement.  You will work with an aging workforce that   is waiting for someone to tell them to retire.  The company resources in-house are world class, but the field is left to their own devices.
Advice: Take better care to investigate employee work-life balance.  Structure your teams with an equal parts experience, ambition, energy, and knowledge.  Question local behaviors and activities and match them with the corporate perks.  Take care of the field employees and do not overtly make them feel like an expense.
Pros: There is great job security here, but not really much room for ambition.  If you don't mind doing the same thing until the end of your career than this is a place for you.  There are not many leadership opportunities, and those that are come rarely but last for life.  In healthcare work-life balance is an afterthought.  You must make that a personal goal to achieve for yourself, or else the company will use as much as you give and ask for more.  Great benefits though.

Cons: These are not really cons but a by-product of the pros that management should keep an eye on so it doesn't get out of hand.  Highly intelligent and passionate people in an excellently paid environment will lead to a very competitive work environment.  Some members are not looking out for the whole but their next promotion.  The fierce competition can diminish genuine and authentic connection cross functionally.
Advice: Internal competition is a double edge sword.  Not enough competition and complacency may set in.  Too much internal competition and the environment switches from fun and exciting to fear and secrecy.  Continue to promote authenticity, transparency, trust, cross business/function communication and fun place to work.  I believe the latter leads to higher innovation capacity than the fierce internal competition that sometimes exist.  Human leadership should be just as important as business leadership so recognize both and reward both forms of leadership.  God speed on all your endeavors to help humanity.
Pros: The people are very intelligent and passionate about science.  The pay and benefits are excellent.  Excellent employee development opportunity are always present if you are willing to make the effort.  The business is very profitable and stable.  Executive management cares about their people.  Most of them speak with empathy and genuine support for their people.

Cons: Many re organization currently ongoing
Advice: None
Pros: Great for people personal growth

Cons: Away from home all the time
Advice: N-a
Pros: Nice benefits, travel, working condition

Cons: Lots of turnover between employees
Advice: None
Pros: Management is good
People are very nice

Cons: - can be difficult to get foot in the door (some positions are initially hired as temp workers)
- corporate red tape (typical of many companies this size) and being in an FDA-regulated industry means change is slow to occur, and processes can become bogged down/inefficient.
Advice: Management generally does a great job of valuing, respecting and rewarding employees.  Overall, this is a fantastic place to work.  I see this as a company where I can actually have a long-term career and a financially sound retirement at the end (something most U.S. companies can no longer offer in this day and age).
Pros: - solid, stable, respectable company
- friendly, yet professional corporate environment
- career development and advancement is encouraged
- generous health care and retirement benefits (which most U.S. companies no longer provide)
- generous vacation, sick day and personal day allowances
- good morale among employees
- challenging and interesting work
- good feedback provided on work performance and goals
- long-term loyalty among many employees
- promote from within (many senior managers started out in entry-level positions)
- opportunity to work alongside and learn from very bright and skilled people
- company puts their money where their mouth is, in terms of community service and charitable giving; they do a lot of good for the community/environment and encourage employees to do the same

Cons: Too anchored in processes, too big
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, values and compensation

Cons: There's been lots of change recently.
Advice: None
Pros: Has been a great place to work.

Cons: toxic culture, lot of people work under 40 hrs, animosity between groups, low salary vs competitors
Advice: None
Pros: Free snacks, people are nice in your group, benefits are good too, name recognition when you leave

Cons: Poor management and lots of favoritism
Advice: None
Pros: Salary and work environment is great

Cons: constant upper management change always
Advice: None
Pros: great benefits takes care of employees

Cons: Not many cons here, generally good
Advice: None
Pros: Good culture. Good benefits. Overall

Cons: Corporate takeover of Ariosa by Roche was an integration nightmare. No support from Roche for over 2 years during the "Integration Process" until suddenly the hammer came down and staff were rushed to sign off on training's that were halfass at best.  The previous biotech start up culture was open and productive. When Roche took over that went away and Roche continued to cut costs at  the San Jose site because of failures and bad investments at other sites.  A lot of talent was lost, employee retention became a major issue. HR culture is a nightmare.  They seem to have completely lost sight of what HR is supposed to do and instead run things like they are the Gestapo.
Advice: Gut HR starting from the top and rebuild.  There are only a  couple of  qualified people currently working in SJ Roche HR . The rest in HR  should have to reapply for their position and only be hired back if they can prove they are helpful, resourceful and productive. 
Instead of throwing the occasional on site celebration try  and build  the culture with consistent work incentives.  Bonus's  are  based more on popularity then productivity.
Pros: Fairly good benefits. There are a lot of great co-workers and talented minds. Most everyone is willing to pool ideas and think outside of the box. Opportunity to learn many new processes including automated sample processing in the Bio Tech world.

Cons: The biggest drawback is that they are closing this particular site in the next year!  However, there are other opportunities that have been created at other sites around the world.
Advice: Continue to take advantage of the management training that is offered by the company - most people aren't "born managers" and many find themselves managers by default because someone has left the company or been promoted.  The training classes, combined with identifying a mentor, will be a huge benefit for new managers, as well as managers who need a "refrehser".
Pros: Roche is a global company with a great deal of diversity and a real cosmopolitan feel.  The company consists of many acquisitions of smaller companies, and although the acquired companies would probably prefer to preserve their autonomy, Roche makes an effort to globalize the various components and look for synergies that make sense from a business perspective, as well as offer greater efficiency.  Their benefits are great and there are many opportunities for advancement at the middle management level.  The company is highly ethical and concerned about sustainability, as evidenced by their environmental programs and comprehensive sustainability reporting.  They are also extremely supportive of education and personal development.

Cons: When leadership is good, it is good. When it isn't good, it sucks.  Unfortunately, when good leaders are put in roles they are moved around quickly. Advancement is nil unless you are in the boys club. Even the few women who get promoted are promoted as pawns for the men. Politics are horrible and collaboration between teams is hard. We are all supposed to be on the same side but leadership and people who are allowed to be idiots ("oh it is just so and so's way....") make work harder. And if you are very good at your job as a worker bee, it is highly unlikely you are going to be promoted. They want you to continue in that capacity. They under use talent.
Advice: Stop shuffling people around so quickly.  Hold leaders accountable to excellent leadership practices. Stop with the damn boy's club. Hold leaders accountable for their teams' attitudes. Take a second look at the people asking to be in leadership. You can be a worker bee and have great strategic thinking. Challenge employees using their skill sets.
Pros: Benefits, some work life flexibility, nice buildings

Cons: Top company management are good bankers, but not particularly at developing new drugs.  Of late, frequent reorganizations have made it difficult to advance compounds in the development portfolio.  Several compounds discovered in Palo Alto have been outlicensed and are in clinical trials for other companies, which is very frustrating.  Organization is bureaucratic.  Employee morale in Palo Alto is not good at the moment due to impending site closure.
Advice: Move as quickly as possible on merger with Genentech.  Currently, you have chaos at three sites (Palo Alto, Nutley, and South San Francisco).  The sooner this is resolved the better.
Pros: Functional management and colleagues are great.  I have worked at Roche for several years and have nothing but respect for most of my scientific colleagues.  Projects are varied and interesting - plenty of opportunity to do good science.  Compensation is only average in comparison to other companies, but benefits are excellent.  Work-life balance is good - lots of company support for employee activities and clubs, at least at the Palo Alto site.  Palo Alto stands out locally as a "green" business - a matter of pride for many employees.

Cons: The Roche acquisition changed the color of things at Ventana; we're not a scrappy start-up anymore.  We went from biggest fish in a small pond (something to hang your hat on) to tiny fish in a big ocean ($500m revenue is a drop in the bucket to Roche Dia's billions).  Still vital, and absolutely crucial to Roche's diagnostics portfolio, however.  Many people are seeing the recent consolidation of commercial operations to Indianapolis as a death knell; those people don't realize that Ventana is more than US commercial operations.  Sorry to see friends go, but it's optimizing operations and freeing up space for Development, Manufacturing, Marketing and other global organizations to grow.  Many of those leaving already have jobs in Indy, so net job loss is minimal.
Advice: Transparency is King, particularly in challenging times such as we're in now with some recent high profile departures.
Pros: The culture can't be beat- it's embraced by nearly every employee.  The products are best-in-market and getting better.  Top-notch science and experience- such that even Roche's pharma competitors are in long lines to sign contracts with Ventana for companion diagnostic work.

Cons: This company is so racist! Pleasanton Santa Clara and San Francisco locations are filled with most Caucasian or Indian people. Even the people in HR are idiots and they don’t hiring many people of color. Once you work for this company you see the favorite within the business group teams. Even the hiring is ridiculous, I’ve been denied multiple times for positions I clearly qualify for and ones that I over qualified for and all they did was deny me. If you’re in the Bay Area and you want to work for Roche you have to be white or Indian or lucky. They have entry level positions on the Eastcoast USA but none on The Westcoast and if they are they’re from grad students. They really need to remodel the whole Bay Area when it comes to staff and employees. I use to really look up to this company and what they stood for until I found out all of this , Now I hate this company and wouldn’t recommend working for a racist organization.
Advice: You all should be fired. You barely know how to do your jobs. The only people you hire are Indian or Caucasian. You show favoritism. Unprofessional and unhealthy people to work with.
Pros: There’s no pros at Roche in Pleasanton Santa Clara and San Francisco CA offices (Maybe San Jose to) The Bay Area in General

Cons: Other companies also have good benefits.   No upward mobility for age 40+.  Being outcompeted for package on pay and benefits.  No leadership mobility for those who are not Swiss or married to Swiss.  The company idea of diversity and inclusion, which is part of their company Video training on D&I, is a room of white men from different countries.    Latest reorganization is unfavorable to Americans but favorable to Swiss citizens, even though American economy is contributing over half to Roche revenue. Claims to be agile, but it is just a word for the company.
Advice: D&I means black, white, Latinos, LGBTQ, and Americans, especially people of color, deserve more respect.  Stop giving privileged treatment to the Swiss and be equitable to Americans, and other countries.  Stop the cyclical removal of older workers in your talent refresh initiatives. Aryan/German leadership are not the only viable pool of leaders in the world.
Pros: Benefits.  Good place if you want to stay at the same job for 20+ years and you have no aspirations for promotions.

Cons: some inertia in translating results to clinic
Advice: None
Pros: lots of interesting projects to choose from

Cons: - Very little recognition of work/life balance. I have noticed others pointing to this as a "pro". Not at all the case in my department so obviously varies by business unit/department. Sr. management used to at least give this lip service, now does not even mention it. In fact was told some time ago that the "expectation" was that everyone should be working at least 50-60  hours/week.
- Significantly underresourced - both with budget and people - for the things the company wants to accomplish. We move forward with intiaitives that are bound to fail because there is not enough money or time to do them right.
- Very "old school". Little innovation happening. When innovation or a new approach is proposed, it is like pushing a large boulder up a hill to get understanding and buy-in.
- Very few opportunities for advancement once you reach a certain level.
Advice: Hire in the appropriate areas. You are burning out very good people in the areas you need them most.
Recognize and appreciate diversity of genders, roles and areas of expertise. Not everyone wants to fit the traditional, stoic company mold of rotation, promotion, rotation, promotion. You may find those that don't "conform" to the old, traditional norm are your most valuable assets.
Pros: - Good pay
- Good overall benefits package
- Smart people
- Large company environment (a pro and con)
- Inept senior leadership in some areas

Cons: Roche is a very political organization with very few experienced people in mid- and senior management level positions. Employees are not judged on their contributions; they're often judged based on who likes whom resulting in significant amounts of mobbing (bullying). Consequently, top talent frequently leaves the company and this is weakening their sales and marketing strength. And if you're a woman in the organization, your chances of being promoted to a management position are slim. This is a company that actually has an MBO to promote women into management roles. What does that tell you about how women are really thought of at Roche? If you're a man and you know how to mob your staff, your chances of getting ahead are far more increased. Treating your staff fairly just doesn't seem to be the real Roche way even though you will read that 81% of employees are happy working at Roche. It's rubbish! Don't believe one word that Roche employees are so satisfied with working there. If you are considering a position with this company, don't walk...RUN in the opposite direction!
Advice: Roche has a plethora of tools such as their Code of Conduct book and their Employee Appraisal/Evaluation process book that they give to employees when they're hired. Perhaps Mr. Schwan and his Sr. HR team should pull them out of their drawers, dust the covers off and re-educate and remind themselves as to how to truly treat and respect their employees.
Pros: The salary and benefits are quite good. Roche enjoys a good reputation in the IVD. The jobs are interesting and challenging.

Cons: Not enough time off for family
Advice: None
Pros: Awesome work place with people

Cons: I can't think of Amy cons at this time.
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work and supportive coworkers.

Cons: The largest complaint I had was how long it took to push a project through to completion. A lot of this was caused by implementation of Roche policies after the acquisition, and some is caused by a lack of communication between departments, which is a bit baffling when one considers the number of meetings which take place. These issues are ones which I believe plague many larger companies. Ventana certainly continues to make efforts to fix the procedural problems. There are also some issues with using old technology and re-implementing designs which had flaws in the first place, without spending more time and resources for innovation.
Advice: None
Pros: Beautiful campus in Oro Valley, northern Tucson, with the Catalina mountains as a backdrop. Many of the younger employees are adventurous and athletic and participate in cycling and hiking and cross fit. Ventana cares about its employees and offers a lot of benefits. Being owned by Roche, there are many opportunities for advancement or relocation, and even just movement within the Tucson location. There are quarterly staff meetings and other events which are catered. The campus is smoke-free! (although this doesn't stop many of the employees from smoking on the sidewalks) and Ventana's management does a lot to promote good health, being a company whose motto is to improve the lives of cancer patients everywhere.

Cons: -The mission of Roche in Tucson has unfortunately shifted from helping patients to generating increased profit and revenue. 
-Due to the senior leadership in Tucson taking short cuts in the past, the environment now is one of constantly reacting to problems which should have been solved years ago.  
-Some portions of senior leadership in Tucson are creating an environment of fear and finger pointing.  
-There is a drive by senior leadership in Tucson to outsource the instrument development and focus on Assay integration and Assay development only.
Advice: -Push back on the company directive of increasing profit and revenue to be passed to other divisions within Roche and invest in Tucson facility.  Focus the culture more on what made Ventana special, it's mission and people.  
-Listen up and take a hard look at some of the senior leadership within Tucson.  They are unfortunately creating a caustic environment which may take a while to repair.  
-Before it is too late, don't let your instrument development knowledge walk out the door.
Pros: The overall company compensation and benefits are great.  The employees are always willing to help each other.  The mission of helping those afflicted by cancer is a noble mission.

Cons: contributing to a team of collaboration with internal and external field.
Advice: TRAINING,  EXPAND ON WELL CARE
Pros: Accomplishments of being a contributor

Cons: Corporate, cookie cutter structure, slow advancement.
Advice: None
Pros: Quality of life is great. Working environment is excellent.

Cons: Closed up operations for good
Advice: None
Pros: Employees were treated fair and good

Cons: Since Roche purchased Genentech and all of Corporate has moved to South San Francisco, jobs are nonexistent.  a Business decision was made to cancel many research projects, some have been transferred to Europe, and now the impending shut down of the Nutley campus leaves most employees looking for employment elsewhere.This infamous research so hard to miss on Route 3 or landing from the North into Newark Airport is scheduled to be fully shut down by January 2014.
Advice: Continue to be compassionate and remember the human factor when you're sitting around the table making your strategic decisions about future directions, the employees loved our blessed Nutley site, and a way of life for us.
Pros: We had excellent benefits, great collaboration between functions, safe environment, great opportunities, fair performance reviews, excellent on-site personal services for employees, great on-site gym.  Severance packages excellent.  Proud to have had such a long-run with a Company who has produced so many life-saving and life-changing pharmaceuticals were discovered from Accutane to Interferon and from Vitamin C to Valium.

Cons: You can expect long hours with little reward for the extra effort in PD.  You might get a lot of additional responsibility but don't expect additional pay.  Management (Director and up) will know they have an issue driven by market conditions, but allow the sales force to be punished financially for the issue and also continue delivering the same criticism of performance, without taking any accountability for their own lack of action. Poor communication, poor operational execution by CPS, lack of leadership at the highest levels of the business unit, etc. People are not rewarded with promotions, in fact people leave and experience far better career growth.
Advice: Live your own cultural beliefs! At the very least give people a chance to be heard instead of listening to one person or side of an issue and making decisions. That is called "Build Trust" and "Transparency".  Be accountable for your own mistakes.
Pros: Medical Benefits are excellent and a great place to work if you want to have kids because you can get 6 months of leave.

Cons: I’ve been here nearly 18 years and it’s a revolving door with good people coming in and then leaving while bad people keep getting promoted and having their egos inflated.  Upper management is political, rude, not transparent, and total cronies.  You can’t trust anyone to not throw you under the bus.  And the company claims they are working on their ‘cultural beliefs’ But those are all just HR check the box activities that none of upper management loves up to.  I’m so sick of the antics, egos, and jockeying for positions.  They’ll tell you one thing in the interview and once you start you’ll be doing something else because of ‘resource constraints’ and ‘we’re doing more with less’ So you get sucked dry of all energy.  Don’t be fooled!
Advice: Listen to your assessment GEOS surveys and don’t mask the problems in HR initiative that look fancy but are not truly lived by.  Kill the politics and start recognizing those that get away with doing nothing because of relationships and those that have contributed loyally  for years.
Pros: The benefits (not including pay) is the only thing that keeps me here

Cons: Diabetes care management, from director and above do not have a clue about how to succeed in the industry.  Completely incompetent!  Run very much like a high school campus, if your are not one of the "cool kids" you are of no value to leadership.  Culturally ... they talk, but do not walk the talk.  The division is dead and most everyone of value has been severanced or left the organization.  MG was either not made aware of what he inherited, or is complacent and expected to oversee the demise of DC.
Advice: Sell for whatever you can get or withdraw and leave the market ... Roche Diabetes Care is an embracement in the industry.  Old technology with no apparent desire to become a leader again. This company has one foot in the grave.  It is unfair to allow the employees to linger in your incompetence and indifference.
Pros: Good Benefits, Salary was somewhat above average for industry.  A once proud and prosperous brand has been decimated by incompetent leadership

Cons: The Good Old Boys network rings true - not just with the men but with the 'home-grown' leaders.  So, in one area, it might pay for you to be a white man in order to get more money and/or promoted.  In another, if you are ‘in’ with another old timer (some of the VPs started out at the bottom level and progressed over the years), your ticket is golden.
Advice: Oh my, where to start:  I'll just say this:  It would help if the people that were promoted KNEW the basics of the job they are promoted to.  Too often the philosophy is:  They did an OK job here so if they are placed in a polar opposite environment, they will do an OK job there as well.  Wrong.  Oh and how about making certain they have some people skills?
Pros: You are paid a decent salary for the work you do - whether you are an hourly employee or salaried.

Cons: Work life balance can be a struggle at times.  The organization is very sales and marketing focused and can lose sight of other intangibles.  Lastly, some business units are struggling and may have a limited future within the Roche Diagnostics Corporation.  Makes sure to know which ones these are before applying for a position.
Advice: Continue make strives in making Roche the best place to work.  However do not lose site that being a great place to work is not just sales performance.
Pros: Making Roche the top employer in the state and in the country is a top priority of management.  Several changes have been made over the past 8yrs to accomplish this.  They have also firmly planted a 'stake in the ground' with the renovation of the entire campus.  The threat of leaving Indianapolis is virtually gone.  They also have a robust individual development plan for their employees.  Great benefits and pay as well.

Cons: As in any big company, governance is complex, and it takes long time to make decisions. But drug development is tough, expensive, and decisions must be very careful made. Work/life balance is great and culture is strong.
Advice: Communicate more often successes and failures. It feels like we only hear about good things, but you need to be more critical with your own work.  Overall, you are doing a fantastic job.
Pros: Roche is an awesome company to work for.  I have worked here, in the Nutley and New York sites, for 6 years (2012-present), and I have had a great experience so far. Roche went through a very hard reorganization process, when management closed Nutley, and yet their treatment of employees was appropriate. I stayed in the smaller site, changing jobs within departments. We perform great research, with fabulous resources, and fantastic team members. We interact with Diagnostics, Genentech, European sites and Chugai. It is a very rewarding experience and I recommend it to anybody. Kudos!

Cons: Poor culture.  Unrealistic goals.  Lack of transparency.  Poor strategic direction.  Senior leadership disconnected from reality.  Poor market access.  Lack of necessary tools to win.  Lack of vision towards the future.  Too many cooks in the kitchen.  Advancement opportunities are posted but are already flagged for someone who has the "connections" to those already in power.  Rewards are not based on results but rather on knowing the right people.
Advice: Take more time to really understand what your employees are going through in their markets.  Spend less time worrying about protecting your own jobs and more time valuing the people driving business at the lowest level. When people feel appreciated and valued, they perform even better.  Make changes from the top when strategies don't work out instead of shifting that blame to those at the lowest level.
Pros: Decent money.  Good Benefits.  Flexible Schedule.  Rewarding work.

Cons: Senior Leadership is based in Europe.  Org chart is messy and there are multiple lines of reporting.  Everyone has different priorities and in most cases they conflict with other's.  My experience is that they (Senior Leaders) do not like to admit that product development and manufacturing are of higher quality and more profitable coming out of the US businesses.  Jobs have been flowing back to Europe.
Advice: Be transparent, recognize that it's OK that you make mistakes and admit when you do!  Remember that you have thousands of employees who have attained various levels of advanced education and experience.  Remember where you were there once and don't think that becuase you've attained a higher level within the organization that you are omnipotent and can stand before the masses presenting strategies and visions that lack data to back it up.  You only erode the respect they bestowed upon you.
Pros: Medical and Pharma provide a realatively secure market.  Pay and Benny's are good!

Cons: Old boys network.  Job blocking to maintain key talent in roles as long as possible.  Limited opportunity for growth.  Sexism both implicit and overt.  Not enough women leaders and male leadership holding positions for far too long.
Advice: Take a serious look at culture of sexism and old boys network that rewards males with less skills and accomplishments over females due to favoritism.  Females must work twice as hard for half the credit.  Take a serious look at your value system and begin to walk the talk.  Ditch the archaic east coast 80s conservative corporate culture and step into the Twenteens!  Your business culture should mirror your sense of leading cutting edge in technology.  Spend more time in the left coast and evolve.
Pros: Cutting edge products, great people to work with.  Leadership encourage innovation.  Culture of accountability.

Cons: Leadership is just about trading offices / positions once a year.  Very cliquish … if you are not part of the core group, opportunities for promotion are limited.  People with 0 or extremely limited background or experience in an area are promoted to director level positions based on social interaction; particularly in DC unit.  DC directors and above are clueless or stale, and they are trickling their incompetence down to field management and sales staff.  Products are 2 to 3 years behind the industry with little prospect of catching up.

Cultural values are frequently spoken and seldom lived.
Advice: Clean out Indianapolis leadership and start again. 
 
Stop following the market; buy some advanced technology and actually get it to market in time, or sell off the AC line to someone that can leverage the heritage.
Pros: Great benefits and good pay.

Cons: Bone-headed management in Product Development with zero-tolerance for mistakes, making everyone fearful to make decisions.  This is touted as Accountability. 
In reality, they are stuck in analysis-paralysis and can't seem to figure out what to do. New products are held up because management has blamed engineering for poor decision-making and is looking to outsource design. In reality, decision-making is the  responsibility of management and out-sourcing the design can't fix poor decision-making.
Advice: Stop passing the buck.
Also, making mistakes is part of design, they just need to be caught before they leave the door.  Iteration is a necessary part of developing anything more complex than tennis shoes. Celebrate when you find mistakes, don't fire people over simple things.
Pros: Great benefits, nice location, interesting product.

Cons: Most of the management in the company is inconsistent (does not share same philosophy, is not streamlined), old fashioned, slow and inefficient processes, slow to make changes happen, and generational gap causes issues at times. Allowing employees to be independent and trusted is rare, work life balance suffers because of this.

Limited options/opportunities to advance
Advice: Trust your employees 
Have realistic expectations of employees 
Align on management styles/philosophy 
Listen to your employees 
Increase Flexibility
Pros: The company has a lot to offer, great benefits and makes you feel comfortable. Great experiences, and many great people to work with! The company does a lot of good in society and makes an impact. Overall, a great company, but depends on who you're managed by and what division you are a part of. A lot of new benefits being implemented, that are meaningful to health.

Cons: I found the culture here to be the most toxic of all companies in my career.  This organization is very political and clicky.  During my time here I have started to take anxiety and blood pressure medicine because of the continued pressure to perform along with constant criticism.  I would not recommend working at Roche to my worst enemy.
Advice: Figure out how to be much more supportive of your people and understand how oppressive random constant unfounded comments are to people.  The company could be a great one with great people but you have a lot of leaders who continually beat on the same people over and over again.  I am excited to be out and away from this environment.
Pros: Roche is a great company with awesome benefits.  They have terrific healthcare, great dental and eye care plus they really are setup well to take care of people.

Cons: You had better work anywhere they want to place you or face the possibility of losing your job.  This means, you relocate wherever they want you to relocate to or face the possibility of being terminated. The environment can be stressful as well and you may not be able to trust those around you or management. Management may turn the other way, even if there are other employees causing a toxic environment and mistreatment of some in plain site of everyone.
Advice: Stop being biased and allow certain individuals to be disrespected, bullied and mistreated by some and say nothing or do nothing.
Pros: The seem like an OK company to work for, but you have to be cautious of how you deal with co-workers.

Cons: The hours can be long and the year-end bonuses are not great. Also, some groups are politically charged leading to squabbles and power struggles. The yearly raises are generally equal to inflation and raises are not significantly higher, even when promoted to a new level. Researchers holding a Bachelor's will not be promoted as quickly as PhDs and are significantly less likely to be promoted to management positions.
Advice: More employees with a Bachelor's degree should be promoted to upper level positions - nearly all management opportunities are given to PhDs.
Pros: The paycheck starts out great and there is support from management to improve your technical abilities. I learned many new techniques and attended several seminars, conferences, and training workshops. There is ample money for lab equipment, travel compensation, and on-campus gatherings.

Cons: Has some long time employees that are in positions of power and not competent or innovative.  Basel in particular is a very non-productive, slow, and bureaucratic in their approaches.  Very poor mechanisms to deal with bad senior management.  Conflict is kept hidden and many back-room deals and negotiations.
Advice: Identify and distinguish between the most productive employees and dead weight.  Empower employees more and fund and reward more innovation.
Pros: Great network of scientists who in general are dedicated.  Diverse cultural background of employees and interests.  Great to be in the Bay Area close to many biotech and technology firms.  Many interesting scientific and clinical problems with fairly good resources to explore solutions.  Employees are generally happy and non-toxic and there is general cooperation.

Cons: My immediate manager wanted HR to be run like GE. GE had a policy of laying off 5% or perhaps it was 10% of its workforce every year. This created an extremely internal competitive culture that was dysfunctional and unproductive.
Advice: Now that Roche merged, I’m not sure of the culture. It is always a good idea to treat your employees well. The number one reason an employee leaves a company is due to their immediate manager. Incorporating a 360 review process for managers gives executives an idea of how employees are being treated.
Pros: At the time, it was still family owned. The family owned 51% of shares. They treated employees well. It was also a European company. Therefore, the culture was better than most large American public companies.

Cons: There are no major downsides, the biggest one being you need to be placed high enough in the hierarchy to receive bonus and stock options.
Advice: None
Pros: The company highly values and invests in Research and Development. Being the market leader in Tissue Diagnostics, this company can dictate the technology and new product pipeline in the industry. The salary is fair and Tucson is one of the best places to live in the country weather wise. The company has flourished under the Roche umbrella while keeping its own identity and that is what makes this company a great employer for anyone interested in Cancer Biology, Biochemistry and Biomedical Devices!

Cons: Poorly defined pathway from contract worker to regular employee status. Undefined of uncommunicative guidelines to achieve this goal.
Advice: The proverbial "stick" is firing, which is perfectly reasonable. The "carrot" for a contract worker is the possibility of joining full staff as a regular employee. However, the carrot is fuzzy, like embarking on a journey of unknown distance, duration, and difficulty. If quantitative performance benchmarks existed, the achievement of which would result in hiring, directed competition would be fostered which would increase profitability beyond the payroll liability  incurred. Set the bar as high as you want, and see who meets it; I dare you.
Pros: This is an effective team with a worthy mission. A culture of independence (rather than micro-management) is fostered. There are many company events of actual interest.

Cons: Corporate bureaucracy is a huge problem. It's like working for the federal government. Roche is so big and there are so many different division and acquisitions, communication is horrible and efficiency is effected. It can take days just to get a simple computer issue solved.
Advice: Lose the arrogance and become more adaptable. Bring the companies tech up to date.
Pros: The pay is good and the company is usually sound. There is opportunity for advancement and you  are clearly expected to gain experience and climb the corporate ladder. "Dead weight" seems to get cut when the inevitable lay-offs occur, which in my experience has been every 3 years or so. As big pharma companies go, Roche is ethical and patient safety is a big issue. 
Work life balance is also encouraged, but I find it ironic that when you drive by late at night or on a weekend, it's not management's Mercedes or BMW's in the parking lot, it's the rank and file.

Cons: No work-life family balance, they work you in to the ground as a result of poor product quality. Marketing is out of step with the industry and products suffer from significant development challenges where lack of planning and proper testing of equipment in the domestic US marketplace fail to reveal quality challenges. The company has a very well defined set of core values but unfortunately no one at high levels of management actually cares.
Advice: To retain and keep top talent and to be the place where people want to work - means a great deal to the people who have worked for Roche in the field and who have desperately tried to hold together a facade for our customers that makes us look like we practice what we preach. In reality as time goes on it is painfully apparent that the core values and desire to be "that place to work," are simply platitudes. Doing now what patients need next - actually has to happen to be true.
Pros: Great pay, good benefits. The field sales team are professionals and wonderful to work with - dedicated.

Cons: There are many talented managers at the company. However, promotions tend to be made based political connections with senior managers, resulting in some incompetents being promoted up to higher management positions.  Some at director level are down right stupid and have no idea of what they are doing.  Some backstabbing helps with promotions as well. The organization is definitely not a meritocracy, with the CEO as the best example.
Advice: Make promotions based on ability to manage projects and people, and not how they are perceived bye their bosses.
Pros: Many talented scientists and hard workers assembled into one organization.  Really nice to have.  Numerous opportunities to move to different groups to gain experience in molecular diagnostics.  Most projects are well funded.  If you are in the right group with a good manager morale is generally high.  Compensation and benefits very good.

Cons: - Too much unnecessary change being passed off as "Agile" leaves many feeling lost and tired
- Lack of clarity about how the mission translates into specific, actionable goals at the function, team and then individual employee levels
- Pay is well-below market in the most critical technical areas
- Cross-functional, matrix alignment hides performance issues and drains accountability from the business
- The culture sucks in our most innovative areas of the business
- TONS of work enters the funnel, but very little comes out the end, leaving one feeling exhausted and confused at times
Advice: Get back to the basics.  Stop trying to do so much and truly EXECUTE.  Simplify the organization structure and invest in developing and retaining your people.
Pros: - Good, smart people with the best of intentions
- Great company health benefits and 401(k) plan
- Fantastic mission that everyone truly supports and understands

Cons: Since GNE integration the management structure is not as secure as in previous years.  Not always willing to acknowledge star performers due to the budget.    Found merit reviews were always depressing and fell short of expectations since everyone is really thrown into one budget bag and it is then divided.
Advice: Dont' throw away the Baby with the bath water.  Need to think about the global company profile with other pharma and biotech companies since the Genentech integration.
Pros: Knowledge sharing between departments and collaboration with colleagues was always excellent.  Good communication between global teams using very modern technology.  Up to date tools and always process improvement on an ongoing basis.  Telecommuting was excellent, dependent on the department and the type of job you had it was possible to negotiate some work from home time.  Very accomodating with work-life balance.  Exceptional benefits,

Cons: Loss of a formerly great company culture; Limited opportunities for advancement; Closure of Nutley, NJ site resulting in loss of great people by the end of 2013; Loss of confidence in management.to stand behind their so-called "committments", which never materialise.
Advice: Please make firm decisions and stop being wishy-washy on life-changing issues that affect employees and their families. When entering new areas of research, give the areas a chance to produce results and flourish. Do not withdraw too soon from the investment made, without giving things a chance to gel, so that results have a chance to appear. Poor planning does not suit upper managment well. Be honest and  more straighforwardwith employees. Kindly note, dealing with employees is not a chess match.
Pros: Great people while they lasted in Nutley.  Good compensation.  Nice views of Manhattan from many of the buildings.

Cons: Upper management doesn't know what they're doing, how to hire managers, how to fire toxic employees, etc
Still no sales.
Below market wage.
A lot of below average, hard to work with employees.
Advice: As a pre-acquisition employee, I got to see a lot about how Genia's internals functioned.

I'd recommend prioritizing valuing your lower level employees.

Upper management needs to show what company values they believe in and lead by example. They tend to be way to focused on just "getting the job done" as an excuse to ignore systemic problems.
Pros: There are a bunch of awesome people to work with.
The project is super cool and involves multiple cutting edge technologies which is honestly pretty special.
Consistent high attendance happy hours.

Cons: I have no major complaints with working at Ventana. The compensation package is fair and the environment is great.
Advice: Keep up the open communication and transparency with all growth that is/will be happening in the coming years.
Pros: A strong culture of accountability and ownership exists at Ventana Medical Systems. Speaking up and making suggestions are encouraged and rewarded. With the recent acquisition by Roche there was some anxiousness about what the future would hold for us, but almost a year latter is seems apparent that Roche likes what we do and is taking a more hands off approach to our business. I have regular and frequent access to my manager and can express concerns or ask questions as they arise.

Combined with all this, the other people I work with enjoy being there too, so I look forward to going to work each day.

Cons: The fact that they completely bungled getting Mircera to market, and now Actemra is significantly delayed.  The entire biotech/pharma industry is in for a change with the new presidential administration and congress.  Much uncertainty around the impending Genentech acquisition.  Even though Roche is buying Genentech, it certainly feels like the new organization is going to be more like Genentech than Roche. (Wanting to preserve Genentech culture....moving commercial operations from NJ to Sout San Francisco).
Advice: It was Senior Management that should be held responsible for the mis-steps with Mircera and Actemra.  Take some accountability and candidly acknowledge that you missed the mark.
Pros: Long-term company strategy is on the mark towards personalized medicine.  The company has deep pockets.  The fact that the company is semi-privately held really allows Roche to focus on long-term results.  Roche is in this business for the long-haul, not to appease Wall Street analyst's quarterly expectations.

Cons: No concept of team locally, teams are spread out all over the world.  Many people work alone.
Functional managers are often in another country and really don't care about your career goals, you are just filling a headcount for them.
Training is a joke, once you are working no additional training is provided.  Goes back to the manager in a different country just needing to fill the headcount.
Advice: Local infrastructure employees need to be better connected and be part of the local team instead of being isolated. Need to develop employees better.  Too many people stay in the same jobs for years and are completely burned out and just waiting to retire.  They resent the new people coming into Roche and are resistant to any changes.
Pros: Benefits are similar to other companies
Competitive pay
Low expectations of employees, easy to succeed
Conveniently located off of I-69

Cons: No more homegrown talent.  Roche acquisition and poor leadership at the corporate level has created massive turnover.  Every single scientific fellow has departed.  This has stunted the innovation engine for years to come.  Lost the entrepenaurial spirit.
Advice: Hiring all senior management from outside the organization builds zero trust and dilutes the culture that made Ventana great.  Have faith in your people and challenge them with greater responsibility.  It builds extreme loyalty.
Pros: Outstanding commercial engine.  Extremely competent sales management. Culture of accountability.  This company began as a start up where every employee had a vested interest in its performance and its mission (positively effect the lives of all patients afflicted with cancer).  This culture created an apolitical organization that fostered teamwork and business success.  This culture is fading but still exists in the commercial group.

Cons: Not unlike any other big company, at Roche you can land the job of your dreams - either bliss or a nightmare.  One manager might be very open and honor the cultural beliefs another will micromanage you out of your sanity.  And no matter how much or what they espouse, office politics are present everywhere.  They are not immune whatsoever to the typical corporate culture in America.
Advice: Ensure your leadership teams align their theory in action with their theory in use.  We hear a lot of espousing of the right things but not matching up with the actions being taken.
Pros: The compensation and benefits outrank most other companies around by a long shot.  Despite constant reorgs and cuts, a lot of people have high tenures overall -- not uncommon to find employees with over 15 years of service.

Cons: Lots of complexity in all areas that goes well beyond that of a large corporation. Risk averse, yet there is constant pressure to innovate. The overly process-oriented environment stifles creativity, while the corporate culture rewards a select few that are chosen for fast-track promotions. Depending on the work area, the pressure in marketing to achieve goals while dealing with process run-arounds can make work-life balance a challenge.
Advice: If you truly want innovation, find ways to support a culture that is not so burdened with risk aversion and  values creativity, rather than cookie cutter solutions.
Pros: Very competitive benefits and nice perks. Most people are very nice. The Swiss values of the company are very ethical and environmentally focused. Most of the products help people, so it can be personally fulfilling to contribute to healthcare industry.

Cons: Although they claim to have calibration meetings during performance reviews to ensure everyone is treated equally when it comes to reviews and promotions the truth is that everyone is not always held to the same standards. At times, people could be getting promotions doing the bare minimum in some groups while others work hard only to be denied a promotion.
Advice: Treat everyone as equally as possible. I realize it may be difficult, but I think a slightly better job could be done.
Pros: I came to Roche shortly after graduating from college and I am very happy with my experience here. I have learned a great deal from my colleagues and have been fortunate to have a great manager and group. Our site is shutting down at the end if the summer so I will be looking for opportunities elsewhere but I would gladly work for Roche again.

Cons: Top management is Ok since the departure of one who is now a CEO at another place. However, not as great as the previous top management which had their eyes on the bottom line but also valued their employees. Current management does not value the employee as seen in more than 5000 employees loosing their jobs at a location they had for more than 100 years. Management would point to performance but needs to look at the performance based on the basket of products available to that location.
Advice: None
Pros: Excellent work processes, continuously reviewed and updated.Well maintained integrated systems, reviewed and updated periodically for robust performance and meaningful data. Fair work life balance and fair compensation. Sense of community in many if not all areas. I travelled extensively for this company (many countries) and have always found most employees to be quiet happy.

Cons: Hierarchial, autocratic management in some cases.  Old style command and control behavior which uses power to try to intimidate by keeping people in the dark and off base.  Bureaucratic and slow to move.  It can be very tedious and require a lot of patience to get anything accomplished.  Culturally the company can be very rigid.
Advice: Respect people and treat them as you would like to be treated.  Include people in decision making and be more transparent.  Exercise leadership by example rather than using your position to intimidate.  You will get a lot more out of people that way and the company will benefit.
Pros: Large company with a diversity of opportunities.  International exposure.  Nice coworkers who are, on the whole, capable and dedicated.

Cons: Diabetes Division is undergoing major reorganization. Medicare reimbursement for blood glucose test strips has been cut in half and this payer segment accounts for over half of the division's annual revenue stream. Employment outlook for glucose meter and insulin pump sales reps is not very good. HQ is most likely going to try and sell off this division in the near future, problem is that no one else wants it either.
Advice: Not a lot of out of the box thinking encouraged here. Upper management is perceived to be an exclusive club that looks out for itself first then looks to how they can improve the work environment for others.
Pros: I worked in the Diabetes Care Division. Roche has good products and provides solid training and support for their field sales people. Their Accu-Check brand is well known to diabetes educators, endocrinologists and pharmacists.

Cons: Work life balance may be a struggle at times when in a field based position only because of the nature of the work.  When you clock in clock out at an office somewhere its easier to leave everything behind as you walk out the door.
Advice: Keep up the excellent work.  Employees who feel valued will work that much harder.
Pros: Review pertains to Diagnostics division.
One of the first things I noticed as I began meeting more and more fellow Roche employees was how happy and committed to the company everyone was.  And now I know why.  Fantastic co-workers, great manager, senior leadership are inspiring and really interested in every employee and fostering a great work atmosphere.  Excellent benefits.  I really can't complain about anything at all.  I feel very taken care of and valued here.

Cons: - TERRIBLE management, especially in business leaders
- While there are smart people in the software org in Belmont, everywhere else has pretty terrible talent in terms of tech
- Terrible innovation, lots of no, everyone is afraid to change anything
- Outdated technology and systems
- Cheap with employees
- Not very smart people in business, which is why diagnostics is treated 2nd class to pharma
- Recruiting outside Belmont is awful
- SO much bureaucracy it's absolutely frustrating
- Tons of promotions, no development; they happily keep low performing employees
- If you disagree with the status quo you're outcasted, berated, told you aren't "One Roche" just because you have a different opinion
- Terrible, I mean terrible, culture
- HR is absolutely clueless in terms of people development, career growth... especially HR leadership
Advice: Get people who actually know what they're doing in SOFTWARE to be the higher ups! The market is going to eat you alive because you operate like it's 1980.
Pros: - Good work/life balance
- It's impossible to get fired if you're a full-time employee
- Great scientists

Cons: Field service for tissue diagnostics means heavy travel, high workload, do more with less=STRESS.  Your key people are getting "Burnt Out".
Advice: I know there's currently some great initiatives to drive positive change, but we need more headcount on FES and FAS sides in areas with larger geographic territories. Numbers will never tell the "true" story especially when they're gamed or don't show overnight travel stays. And not getting scalded for having an admin day when one does happen would be great. This isn't a normal 9-5 job, so managers should stop treating it like one. Let me take care of my own family and business without the 3rd degree. THIS is the main reason I will be looking for other work.
Pros: Excellent mission, great benefits, pay and culture.

Cons: Employment instability, out-dated technologies (intranet, employee portal, training portal), senior management makes odd decisions, product direction is confusion, lack of innovative products, tell you to innovate but innovative decisions are made by a small group of pals, stale culture, lack of decision making causes extra work and stagnates the development process, managers seem to be more focused on meeting their bonuses than the actual product that the customer receives
Advice: Listen to your workers, they have a vast amount of knowledge that is being overlooked.
Pros: Great benefits, fitness center, flexibility in job execution, great to work for a company that makes products that help people, very generous to charities, lots of opportunities to network and volunteer

Cons: Sometimes the better employee is not the one who gets the promotion. Different career paths are not clear to employees and a good employee can get stuck. Possible paths are left for the employee to figure out on there own. "Coaching" can become overly critical and drawn out.
Advice: Listen to employees and if company expects loyalty it must give it in return. There have been several positions eliminated and good people let go. During realignment try to find other positions within the company for affected employees instead of letting them go.
Pros: The benefits are very good. Most coworkers are very good to work with. Products are helping people which is very satisfying.

Cons: New building in Indy for RDC takes around twenty minutes to park and get set up in the new open area work station concept. All employees, mangers, directors, and vps all sit out on the floor now. Has the feel of working in a fishbowl constantly being monitored.  Parking garage is a decent distant from the buildings so will make for long hike during the winters and rainy days.  Also, hard to move around to new opportunities especially if you have been locked into one for a number of years.
Advice: If you trust your employees, treat them with the respect they deserve.
Pros: Challenging demanding work. Great benefits. Decent pay. A lot of knowledgeable, educated workers.

Cons: It's tough when you work for a company's largest market (US) and are still managed from afar. This frustration is compounded when strategies, tools, and programs are developed in the company's much smaller and different home market to apply everywhere. These "gifts" are given to the rest of the world with little leeway in their use. If changes are approved, the cost and time of retrofitting the "gift" falls on the receiving markets.
Although generally good, the prevailing culture, pace, and management style in the business areas vary widely. This is an issue when you move to another area, as you are encouraged to do, because you may go into an unexpectedly stressful environment. I once encouraged a friend to work at Roche. When they described the pressure, management style, and stressful atmosphere in their area I was shocked and embarrassed.
Advice: Avoid laying off seasoned employees for tenure, fiscal or re-organizing reasons. You are casting off a huge investment in their wisdom and experience. Instead, have that challengeing conversation to see if something could be arranged so that your investment isn't walking away to benefit the competition.
There are many ways to avoid meetings that still accomplish the goal of the meeting. Start implementing these alternatives and foster a "meet as a last resort" culture, which will increase productivity and reduce stress. If a meeting is unavoidable, give equal planning time to the  "how" of a meeting segment as well as to the "what", which  usually receives all the focus.
Pros: Most of the areas I worked in had a good culture and working environment. There were a few flighty ladder scramblers, but most of the people were solid hard-working folks who made working there a pleasure. The pay and benefits were very good, which I belatedly realized I'd taken for granted!
The products are high quality and provide many positive aspects, which employees can feel good about. For example, you might work with a product that helps diabetics better control their disease or an instrument used in labs seeking the cure for diabetes or devices that are fast and accurate, getting you health answers quickly.

Cons: I've worked at lots of companies and never seen one that has as many reorganizations. These reorgs seem mostly aimless, though Sr Mgt justifies them as adapting. Mostly Sr Mgt reorgs to justify their own position and embellish their own fiefdoms. There's always employee casualties as there's little effort paid to finding other spots within the company.
Advice: Constant [internal] change creates insecurity, hinders teamwork and wastes time and resources.  Spend less time telling employees they're valued, and more time developing a stable environment that permits employees to more effectively do their job(s).
Pros: Mostly fun work atmosphere. If you're female or a minority, you're golden. If you're an older white male, not so much.

Cons: Lower salary than my peers in other companies
Typical large company bureaucracy
Technologically they are behind other companies in support of employee productivity
Advice: Continue to push the performance management and show more courage to remove the barriers for people to perform their best.
Pros: Many interesting projects across all departments in Roche
Good job opportunities globally.  Very good expat opportunities for those who are interested.
Growing company with successful products both in Pharma and Diagnostics.
Global focus on many projects that makes them challenging and interesting at the same time.
Market leader in oncology drug development and sales.  Growing their franchise in RA.
Solid financial position relative to other pharmaceutical companies that should continue in the future.
Relatively good personal working environment at most sites

Cons: Layoffs have occurred due to the genetech take over
Morale is suffering
Colleagues at Genetech are very arrogant and filled with false self-importance
Little opportunities in Nutley due to site being downgraded from an HQ to an R&D backwater
Advice: Really need to keep Genentech under control and make them more accountable for their costs. You really need to build up the Nutley site and have more opportunities. The Genenetech take over was a really bad decision--paying top dollar during a recession for a company that is not very effective.
Pros: Easy commute to NYC via public transportation. 
Good benefits, many campus amaenities (ie, on-site doctors/nurses, cafeteria, friendly people, social activities/clubs sponsored by Roche).
Salary is good

Cons: If you are lucky enough to have a pension from this company you are a marked target.  They will find a way to get rid of you so they don't have to pay it. When you hear "it was a business decision" you'll know they just saved themselves some money at the expense of your years of loyalty and commitment.
Advice: There is a special place reserved for those of you doing the dirty work.  It is immoral and unethical and you have to look in the mirror every day.
Pros: Benefits are good but used to be better...job security used to be good but now is gone forever. You can be the hardest working employee and one day...it's taken from you for no reason at all. So be loyal to the highest bidder and change companies often.  Chase the dollar and new opportunities.

Cons: There is a lot of movement in management due to the multitude of career opportunities.  It is hard to work on your on career development when you don't have a manager to talk to regarding what you want to do and how to get there.
Advice: Work with your employees, ensure they know what options they have to advance their careers at Roche.  Engage in conversations in career development.
Pros: Roche is a family oriented company.  I have a work/life balance and my hours are flexible.  There are many career opportunities available for employees to move into to gain more knowledge and skills.

Cons: Management proclaims a certain culture, but they do to live it. Their internal survey ranked high because there are so many new employees who haven't learned what is really under the hood. Highly political and hierarchal. It would depend what area you work in and who you work for on how you will do. Go to Genentech which they own better environment and culture.
Advice: Not optimistic the management would really care as it shows in the environment. A lot of fluff, unless you are in upper management.
Pros: Great benefits and PTO.  The campus is nice and company has growth with acquisitions and within the industry.

Cons: Very slow and bureaucratic.  There is a good amount of politics, and people who move upward know how to play that game.  It's basically what you'd expect from working at a giant company.  Compensation is mediocre.  For a company this large, there is a surprising lack of process in certain areas.
Advice: Try to better streamline and define your processes.  Reward good work, not just people who look like they're doing good work.  Keep hiring good people.  

Things aren't bad enough to leave, but not good enough to be excited.
Pros: People are generally very smart and friendly, and open to share their thoughts.  I've called many other Roche sites worldwide, and people are always happy to collaborate and help however they can.

Cons: There are some in senior RA management positions who are out to further their  careers and do not put enough effort into mentoring and growing the team.  All time is spent managing up and not enough managing down.  This results in many talented people leaving the organization
Advice: Pay close attention to the morale of groups within the organization.  Sometimes the successes of a group happen in spite of the VP and not due to their efforts.  many people are self driven.
Pros: Very good benefits - great projects - growing business.  The company also has very smart people who are great to work with and all work towards the same goals.

Cons: Even tho I was terminated, I still don't really have anything negative to say about the company.  Some areas have the "mob mentality" so if you're the newest member and someone doesn't like you, it could be rough if leadership puts their trust in the wrong people.  Peer to peer feedback is encouraged and accepted, but unfortunately there are still people who prefer drama over professionalism.  Every company has a few cons, but at Roche the pros far out way the cons for anyone who can rise above the few bad apples, can accept as well as give constructive feedback , and that depict the Roche Cultural Beliefs in everything they do.
Advice: Stay true to your leadership training and the Roche Cultural Beliefs.  I believed in my leadership and trusted them to have my best interest heart.  I believed them when they told me "your performance and work ethic will take you far in your career here," "your dedication to the team, our customers, and stake holders is inspiring and present in everything you do," "you're a rockstar and can't wait to see all the great things you will accomplish." I was told there were members of my team that were threatened by me.  I asked how to approach that and was told I had nothing to worry about.  I asked because I wanted to be respectful and a positive addition to an established team, and as an admin my role was to support the team in anything they needed.  I was no threat because I was the only admin there wasn't any competition so to speak. I supported leadership that trusted my ability to get things done correctly the first time, and at times that put me in situations to where I was leading a task that would normally have been something the other members of the team would do prior to me joining the department.  Due to my experience in a different role within the organization it made perfect business sense for me to complete the task, and I even went as far as offering to work with the other members and advise them who to reach out to in order to avoid any delays so that they could easily lead the task and I could just be support if needed.  My leadership failed me by not following their training, the Roche Cultural Beliefs, and Roche policy regarding corrective action or disciplinary action.  Had they done so, I could've have proven with multiple emails and provided the names of the individuals who I worked with to complete 2 very specific tasks that I was rewarded with Applause points for stepping in and completing, yet were used as examples of "ineffective performance" and resulted in my termination.  It's unethical and morally wrong to terminate an employee for
"Ineffective performance" when there are disciplinary records and no documented counseling for performance concerns or anything for that matter,  less than 2 weeks after telling them they are meeting and exceeding expectations at their level and performing some duties at the next level. It's very apparent that I was targeted and failed a popularity contest with my peers; but if a peer is threatened by a peer and fails to give feedback because they are not professional and adult enough to do so and instead complains to leadership, it's leaderships responsibility to address the situation with both employees because you can't be held accountable for something you don't know about it.
Pros: Fantastic benefits, great opportunities for advancement, leadership truly encourages a healthy work-life balance, majority of employees are genuine and believe in the work they do. Hard work and innovation is rewarded.

Cons: The salaries paid by Roche appear to be lower than other comparable companies.  No stock options to offset the lower salaries.  Because it is a large company the work is compartmental and it can be difficult to get a clear picture of everything that has been done.  Tend to be a litle slow in embracing change and taking risk.
Advice: Keep the communications channel open.  Make sure employees feel all relevant information is being delivered in a timely manner.
Pros: Reasearch facilities are top-notch and it is not an issue to purchase new equipment or expensive reagents.  A majority of the research people are extremely qualified and great to work with.  Support publishing work and attending and presenting work at international conferences.

Cons: We work 12 hours shifts and every other weekend.  So the days get long and I don't like working on the weekends.  Alot of things are based on senority which I think is kind of out of date.
Advice: Don't be afraid of change.  Just because that is what Roche has always done doesn't mean that is how we have to do thinkgs all the time from here on out.
Pros: Management is working hard to get outside business so that we can be self sufficient.  With all that is going on in the world, I am not only thankful to have a job, but thankful to have health insurance and work for a company that is growing, not just surviving or on the downward slide.

Cons: - No room for advancement 
- Company is moving many jobs to its headquarters across the company
- Many people in positions they are not qualified for; got in before Roche took over and there were no degree requirement. This hinders people trying to advance their careers. 
- Most of the time there is already someone they have in mind before a job is posted
- Upper Management is not transparent at all, can not believe what you are told most of the time.
Advice: - Treat all employees with respect
- Help employees who are reaching out for assistance with career development - be mentors
Pros: - Great campus
- Perks such as having a cafe and nurse on site
- Health benefits are some of the best I have seen

Cons: Leadership is driving costs down over time which has several unpleasant outcomes -

* as jobs move to other countries, you have more early morning meetings with people in other time zones
* all the entry level jobs are gone
* if your job can be moved somewhere less expensive, it will eventually move

The leadership wants as few people in SSF as possible, and the remaining positions are high paying, but come with high expectations.

People used to always say "it's not Genentech anymore," but it's not the old Roche anymore either. The company has transformed into a very fine-tuned and financially driven machine. It's impressive, but I really miss Genentech.
Advice: None
Pros: Pay and benefits are really good
Bonuses
Supportive executive leadership
Great campus
Nice gym
Patient focus

Cons: Management can seem a bit standoffish at critical times. 
Politics is the word of the day at Roche.  If you're politically savvy, you'll go far there. Of course that could be the case with any company, but it plays out more openly at Roche, in my opinion.
Advice: Management could do more to support employee growth in current and prospective positions. I believe ambitious employees will be able to see greater upward mobility if management were to support professional development for a prospective role.
Pros: Great work environment for professional stimulation. Will raise your professional bar.
Products are well respected in the industry, both with customers and competitors.

Cons: Roche is a very conservative organization that is heavily regulated in the US and the rest of the world.  This limits product development cycles and overall project timelines and budgets.  Career growth can be limited and there does exist the possibility to be "pigeon-holed" into assignments for long periods of time.
Advice: Walk the talk with regards to creating a organization where the employees are empowered to make decisions to move efforts forward.  Find a way to stabilize the portfolio and make decisions accordingly.
Pros: Challenging projects
Very competent and diverse work force
Very good overall compensation
Company is well positioned in the current global environment
International opportunities exist for those who are interested

Cons: Currently not knowing when our jobs will be ending. Until the purchase of Genentech is complete it is hard to throw yourself in work 100%.  It has been a great run but we need to know when it is ending.
Advice: Communicate as much as possibel and be honest. The local management is very open and honest in all communications. That does make it easier to wait for the lay off.
Pros: The people.  I have found almost 100% of the people that I have contact with are great people. This includes those in other divisions and locations. The work enviornment is also easy to operate in. They try to boost morale as much as possible. They still offer a company pension,

Cons: Middle Management

Some of the directors and senior managers are not competent (many are though).  

The incompetent ones are the obvious elephants in the room, but upper management doesn't seem to reprimand appropriately, and prefers to sweep it under the rug with a guise of using the Culture of Accountability versus tackling the problem head on.  

The incompetent middle management personality types fall into two main categories: they are either never around, or they are micro-managers who don't know what they are talking about and mask their ignorance and incompetence by questioning and talking condescendingly to functional study team members.   

The micro-managers get so wrapped up in details of everything, but they're never around to know the details so they endlessly scrutinize all the work the study teams performs which inevitably stresses out the team members who deal with the details and study work on a daily basis. It would be one thing if they understood processes and had valid, constructive feedback and points to make, but they question and scrutinize for the sake of hiding their own lack of knowledge and to feed their superiority complexes at the end of the day so they can go home feeling accomplished for doing something other than complaining and pushing emails all day.

The micro-managers also have a double standard of what they require of functional study team staff compared to what they provide themselves. They require transparency but do not complete the flow by being transparent downward (even to their own staff); They harp other functional areas to complete dependencies sooner than expected to compensate for their own delays in timelines. 

This ultimately crushes morale and turns staff off from even wanting to interactive with these individuals.
Advice: - Scrap having middle management sign off on study documentation and leave this to the functional leads 

- Before they send out interrogating emails and belittle member in the occasional study team meetings they attend, have middle management train on processes and work instructions which they clearly don't understand due to just clicking a training button in the training system

- Above all, stop ignoring the issue as to why staff keeps leaving. Clearly there is a pattern.
Pros: Overall the company is on the better side of biotech and innovative when it comes to diagnostics.  Functional leads and support staff are great to work with, and the work is straight forward.

Cons: Toxic, highly politically charged environment, archaic HR.
Advice: Treat your employees as human beings first - that have a life outside of Roche. If an employee suddenly isn't performing as well as they were, it is most likely an issue in their home life. Rather than building a case to dismiss them and put them on a fake PIP for documentation - perhaps try to figure out a way to connect with them on a human level - and support them with personal life - to get the most out of them - and have them go above and beyond for you.
Pros: Good pay, benefits, and stability if you find the right team.

Cons: Senior management (NAOC) has very little idea of how to actually run a successful sales organization. They get bogged down in the task-oriented society where everyone at Nutley is busy CYA. I can't believe more heads didn't roll after the horrid way they handled Cera in the United States. Plan B? No, we don't need a Plan B. If Actemra hits a few snags (and why wouldn't it?) plan on Roche NA being significantly smaller in 2010 than it was in 2007.
Advice: Recycle & replace most members of the NAOC.
Pros: Large company with plenty of funds available for investment or acquisition. Drugs will receive national and international attention - even if that attention is primarily negative in recent years.

Cons: Management hierarchy based on politics on not on ability or merit.  Too many meetings and yet too many groups not coordinated in efforts.  The management does not match the talent of the people who work there.  Cutural divide between headquarters in Basel and other sites.
Advice: Reward talent and results and streamline divisions
Pros: Large company with lots of resources and interesting projects.  Multiple sites and multiple divisions with interesting people working on a variety of problems through discovery and development.  Generally good benefits, pension, and working atmosphere.  Ability to interact with colleagues in multiple countries and ability to potentially have multiple careers within one company.  Ability to attract and review vendors.

Cons: The Swiss like their money; you are only a number and when the bottom line numbers are not met, then you realize how "valuable" you are as an employee.  Hit and miss top level management.  The good realized that it was time to leave several years ago.  The bad found a way to stay.
Advice: Try to be human.  Numbers, profit, spreadsheets, are all a game.
Pros: Once you're in, there's a ton of areas to advance.  Pay is very good, benefits are excellent.  This is a solid company and the experience you gain speaks for itself when you decide or have to take work someplace else.

Cons: Frequent layoff cycles.  Upper management will swear, up and down, that a site will be kept open and then announce the site closure the next day.  Many people were moved from Palo Alto when that site was closed, and then the Nutley site was closed less than 2 years later.
Advice: Don't move people to a site you know is closing very soon.  Don't tell people you're keeping a site open, and then announce the closure a few months later.
Pros: Very professional.  Excellent career development opportunities.  Plenty of chances to learn new things as part of the job.

Cons: Poor work/life balance in the R&D organizations--Overtime is expected.
Not enough office space--many managers have to share offices
Travel is over-managed--Roche allows business class travel for international trips, but for some reason this unit of Roche will only allow coach for all employees under the level of Director.
Many senior level personnel have left the company due the restrictive nature of the Roche culture
Growth has slowed significantly with little opportunities for growth.
Manufacturing is a after thought.
Advice: Fix the life-balance issues
Improve the development process to focus on quality and less on schedule
Fix the travel policy
Pros: Excellent health and 401 benefits
Casual dress environment
Emphasis on promoting women--there a number in major roles
Emphasis on R&D--there are a high number of Ph.D level employees

Cons: The walk from the parking garage to the office could be a challenge in the winter or the rain, etc.  There is no parking right next to the buildings anymore, just a centralized garage.  If you are a pack rat or like things printed on paper or like to "own" your own space, this company may not be for you!
Advice: Add a coat/ boot room please!
Pros: The new buildings on the Roche campus are great.  Very progressive design and lots of opportunity to stay healthy.  Huge gym with great equipment, fitness classes, etc.  Cafeteria has lots of healthy choices and delicious food.  And free, fresh gourmet coffee!!

Cons: Unfair/unbalance workload (Depends on the group you are in). Do not have realistic timelines on projects.  People are expected to work overtime all the time.    At the same time, some other group has no timeline and layback.    People get penalized for working hard while some people are getting free rides all the time.
Advice: Please listen to your people and be fair.  Please work on morale.  People are restless and they are staying for the compensation only.   Performance review gets too complicated and calibration does not work well.
Pros: Compensation!  It is a big company and has name recognition.   Palo Alto has a really nice campus.

Cons: Sometimes upper management seems somewhat distant.  It is a global company and has that big corporate feel most times.  Due to the large size of Roche it lacks the energy one can get a smaller company or start-up.
Advice: Management needs to find a way to be more accessible to the employees.
Pros: The facilities are nice the building is green.  The commute is OK if you live in the East Bary and it is close to BART. The people are very nice and there are social activities for those interested.  Roche is a stable company that rarely seems to have layoffs and often is buying new companies.

Cons: Employees are treated like pawns with no regard to their careers. They are moved about and titles changed during reorganizations without consulting the employee. At one point a manager told me, "Careers are dead. There is no such thing as a career anymore." 
As stated in the Pros the larger companies ideals are sound but the implementation and accountability is lacking.
There is too much concentration power in management. There is top down planning with very little input from those doing the actual work which means long hours.
Advice: Pay attention to your employees career growth. Don't move them about like pawns. Be more forthcoming during reorganizations and allow employees to choose to leave before getting battered about. Do better by incorporating bottom up planning.
Pros: The larger companies ideals are sound.

Cons: Either you're a lifer or a temp or newly converted to permanent. Very slow pace if you want to move up in titles have to leave your department. Lifers (usually the ones in charge) are not really open to change and improvement to records. The culture values are great in theory but are not always followed in manufacturing.
Advice: Improve communication between and within departments.  Stop the its not my fault culture and figure out a better solution. Management can learn to foster better relationships with those under them.
Pros: Good benefits. Lots of recreation groups and a caf that serves decent food at low costs. Lots of opportunity for overtime. You go to work, do what you have to do and leave- no one watching and tracking your time.

Cons: Sometimes the people were overly nice and difficult to read.  Transparency with employees could have been better.  Managers need to be straight with employees.  I felt employees did not have a good, truthful understanding of why their careers may not have been progressing the way they wanted it to.  Too much "Group Think" often stifled innovation.
Advice: Clearer Career Paths and Competencies are a MUST for an organization this size.  Employees need better direction from management on career planning and what competencies they need to demonstrate to be considered for different roles, promotions or even a lateral move.
Pros: The organization paid well and the environment was very professional and collaborative.    The culture was good and programs were being implemented to further enhance the culture.

Cons: Mid Level Managers / Supervisors were not very knowledgeable about detailed aspects of the tests.  Many of the mid level supervisors were good at delegated assignments but did not input much of the technical knowledge.  A large percentage of supervisors are hired from outside companies and very rarely promoted from within Roche.

Roche employs a large percentage of contract workers.  Many hope to secure a permanent full time position but few do.
Advice: Upper management needs to assist mid level managers and supervisors in dealing with employees.  Supervisors must obtain greater knowledge about products (assays and instrumentation).
Pros: The bench work scientists are an educated and highly devoted group of individuals.  They are a team oriented group of workers.  

Benefits are good and Roche is a very stable company.

Cons: Micromanaged by middle management who, a lot of times, did not have a grasp of what was going on within the department.  Focused too much "focused feedback" which at times was very critical and not given in a motivating manner.  One of their core beliefs is "Speak Up" but speaking up could backfire and have a negative impact on your career.  Middle management pretty much wants you to agree with whatever they are saying.  Lost focus of the customer in the time I was there.  Very behind in technology.
Advice: Really look at your middle management...many have not a clue as to what is going on within their departments.
Pros: Decent salary; excellent benefits; enjoyed my co-workers; nice work/life balance

Cons: Very few cons specific to Roche Diabetes Care other than the entire industry is trying to redefine itself in light of increased overseas competition for dwindling healthcare dollars and reductions in reimbursement for prescription blood glucose meter test strips.
Advice: Endeavor to be able to adapt more quickly to marketplace changes and challenges.  Continue the remarkable tradition of superior product quality and community service in the area of Diabetes Care.
Pros: The Diabetes Care Division takes very seriously their product pipeline, production practices, and responsibility for producing quality goods.  Employees are well trained, actively promoted when possible, and generally treated with considerable respect even during times of company downsizing and redirection.

Cons: This company was the worst I've ever worked for in my 20 plus year career.  I've done work for most of the companies on the east coast and have never seen anything like this circus.  Directors and Managers that are totally incompetent and using their "power" to take advantage of their direct reports.  I've seen very many inappropriate relationships while at Roche. HR particularly in Branchburg has and will be hit with numerous lawsuits for wrongful termination as well as covering up and fabricating facts. Could be a great company, but never will be.
Advice: The Swiss need to clean house.  From the top down, this company needs an overhaul.
Pros: Reasonable Salary and benefits provided.

Cons: Until recently the positions were stable and changes resulted in reassignment of personnel rather than downsizing.  More recently company has taken downsizing as a standard practice which is more inline with other pharmaceutical companies.
Advice: The handling of the Roche Palo Alto site closure announcement a short time after a site meeting unrolling a new vision and more or less five year plan for the site left management with severely damaged credibility.  The loss of stability and long term personnel has/will rob Roch of it's historic uniqueness and depth of employee devotion it once had at cost which cannot be calculated.
Pros: A long history of a good work environment with good manager support and reasonable expectations and rewards.

Cons: Since Roche brought out Genentech, the environment has become less secure and friendly. The seat of power in the US is now at Genentech in San Francisco.
Advice: You are losing great talent and replacing it with younger people with dubious talent in Genentech. The merger with Genentech is ruining a once great company from within. Should reconsider the decision to shut down the Nutley, NJ site and build it up more as you have the space.
Pros: Good salary with benefits, nice campus that's not too big, and lots of amenities (Cafeteria, gym, social events, dinners to go). People are friendly and retires and ex-employess often come back to visit. Many people with 30+ yrs at company.

Cons: For part of my time with Roche, I worked virtually which id a difficlut way to work. This would be true anyway your home was your office, but I missed the contact both personally and professionally.
Advice: I had a fabulous boss who gave me leeway to accomplish my work with much freedom. I was always treated with respect and when something went wrong, as it will in any job, they handled it with professionalism, not recriminations.
Pros: A great place to work for people who are serious about the pharmaceutical industry. They treat employees with respect and job are clearly defined. It was one of the more well run pharma agencies I have worked foior

Cons: Very political, old boy network, morale is terrible and upper management breeds a work atmosphere of fear and intolerance.The company is outdated in its leadership style.  It's uninspiring, using old leadership and management techniques, probably due to the fact that Roche Global is a family owned company and runs alot like the catholic church: very hierarchical.  Consequently it all runs down hill: fear, intolerance, paternalistic, narrow minded towards ethnic and diverse peoples, and one gets prompted based not on skill sets and ability but rather who knows who.
Advice: Fire them all.  Start with new senior management then make sure they are thinking like modern thinkers with a forward type vision
Pros: Autonomy, Good Benefits, Decent Salary, Longevity of company, company car, well established in specific disease states (infectious diseases, HIV, oncology), a global company that has leverage in the world.

Cons: Upper managment in Basel is disconnected from the strategy in Palo Alto. Hence the site is getting the short end of the stick - as was evidend with the decision to close it and dispand two well established and qualified therapy areas.
Advice: Be more candid with your strategy communication: people will respect that a therapy area may have been exhausted for its commercial potential versus keeping up a  front, moving a fragment of the staff to a different location pretending to still be active in a given scientific area.
Pros: The scinece has high quality and standards.
Good benefit structure.
Good focus on overall corporate wellbeing, employee teambuilding etc.

Cons: The closure of the Nutley site in NJ will impact the local community immensely and provide competitors with many brilliant and competent scientists. Its a shame Roche did not make greater efforts to retain talent. It was one of the few remaining sites in NJ offering discovery and pre-clinical scientists employment.
Advice: Basel priorities seem more reactive than proactive.
Pros: Roche/Genentech (US) provides employees with excellent benefits and take a great interest in the well-being of their employees. There is a lot of great talent and the research performed is top-notch. The VP took great care of the group and They offer a decent layoff package in the event they close your site.

Cons: A LOT of people changes in 2021 which lead to a lot of underprepared transitions and overworked departments (although it’s clear these moves will be beneficial long term) it’s just stressful and messy right now, siloed departments and even regions of the country, highly regulated industry so sometimes change takes a really long time or process improvement is limited, sometimes because the company is so large it’s hard to keep up with company news or people changes in other departments you work with regularly, in the last few years a lot of tenured (30-50 years with Roche) senior management and executives have retired which leaves the typical hiccups that comes with leadership change and the ripple it has through the chain of leadership
Advice: Really make sure you are fully thinking through the impact of change and not only how it impacts the department changing, but other departments who would need time to prepare or put a plan in place (I’m talking to you Sales leader who dissolved PLS into CD). Ultimately, a lot of changes from 2021 makes sense and will long term be beneficial, but it’s really disappointing to see how it was communicated and executed this year. It feels like leadership could have done a lot better planning, and some teams are now dealing with the consequences and it’s hurting moral. I think training refreshers across the company (leadership* & employees) would be beneficial. Specifically on communicating change, change management and planning (through execution - thinking big picture not siloed), and I think our new hires in some of the more technical roles really need better support and proper time to train before going live in their roles.
Pros: Benefits are top tier, large company means so much opportunity and options for career path, you can learn something new almost every day, Roche really puts the customer first and always is trying to improve whether it’s internal processes, constantly developing new technology and testing, how they handled the pandemic (Working from home March 2020-current [August 2021]), open work stations not cubicles, campus buildings look brand new feels like you’re working in the future, such a flexible and understanding company who clearly cares for employees and shows it via the benefits and campus facilities (gym, cafe, wellness center, Starbucks, park, latte coffee makers everywhere), seen growth in culture over last few years - seen a lot of younger faces with fresh eyes and more people of all ages open to process improvement changes or system upgrades

Cons: Amenities for employees are embarrassingly spare and lack some basics. Middle management and facilities staff point their fingers at the company's "miserly" CFO. This absolutely contributes to the culture here where people are not proud of being employees or as excited about the business as they should be. Unlike many Bay Area tech companies, our employees do not feel like they're being "taken along for the ride."
Advice: On site food. More communication across groups about what people are working on.
Pros: Roche benefits good. The company is very focused and effectively accomplishes research and business goals. Generally relaxed atmosphere. Friendly colleagues. Disruptive, patient care-improving products.

Cons: Investing heavily in bringing very young millennials on while making significantly less investment in current employee career development opportunities. Strong investment in rotation programs for recent college grads while not investing in current employees. Several employee career development on campus events and high potential programs in Indy were canceled or had funding slashed in 2016 while new investments were made in bringing recent college grads on. Also, significantly less focus and resources are dedicated to providing tools to current employees to develop and advance.
Advice: Invest in your employees
Pros: Great benefits
New Indianapolis facilities
Focus on improving lives of patients
Cafeteria and other on campus amenities
Managers listen and care in many groups

Cons: Palo Alto site is closing.  Company is losing plenty of talent due to their Genentech offer.
Advice: It's a pity Roche is giving up the Palo Alto campus site to move to south san francisco.
Pros: Great campus to work at.  Gardens and trees are always maintained.  Good perks such as cafeteria and fitness classes available.   Collegues are friendly and willingly to help anyone when needed.  The company encourages learning by offering seminars and classes to all employees.  It's kind of a semi academic culture, where most everyone is well respected.  Definitely not a cut throat company.  Collegues will offer advice when needed.

Cons: Very fast paced and always more work to be done than can be done.  But never boring.  Not as flexible as a start up being part of a large international company.
Advice: None
Pros: Team environment.  Lots of opportunity for development.  I have been here a long time and seen a lot of change.  Opportunities come and go, but if you are flexible, there is usually something to consider.  Good work/life balance.  Exciting to be part of a growing business and new business unit.  We are the long-timers in Roche Sequencing.  So in many ways we are paving the way.

Cons: Some Management could stand to retrained. Favoritism is blatantly shown in certain departments, which makes it a hostile work environment.
Advice: Management need to be management and not buddy buddy's with their employees. Know how to decipher between supervisory and being a friend. Let your friends be employees and not assistant supervisors with out the pay. Last but not least, if something is told to you in confidence, do not discuss the confident information with your FRIENDS!!!!!
Pros: Company is a great place to work. The facility has a great environment. They also employ some skilled and knowledgeable analysts.

Cons: Way too much politics. Sometimes, they elevate the loud ones instead of the smart ones, like the one who was promoted to VP and overruled the expert with the argument "this is not a democracy". It was a good job and yet I'm glad I am now elsewhere.
Advice: Listen to the rest of us. There are plenty of good ideas being dismissed, which is very sad. You are missing out.
Pros: Salary and benefits were fantastic (e.g. a matching 401(k) AND and pension). I was a member of a great team, good colleagues and supervisor. The projects and products were great too. Lot of fun.

Cons: Lots of driving (10-15 hours average) and 3-4 nights a week in a hotel (Though this could also be a pro if you  love travel) 
Some labs can be dirty, crowded, cramped and can be difficult scheduling with customers if they want you at an odd time.
Advice: No complaints
Pros: In this position, you set your own schedule based on PMs, upgrades, and other tasks that are shared with Field Engineers.
Great benefits- Car, cell phone, computer, travel points, excellent and inexpensive health/dental and great 401k match
Great people to work with
Lots of tools, documents, training at your disposal to get the job done

Cons: Limited vision for future, especially engineering
Cultural beliefs come off as lip service or used to make a point
Management does not lead, and does not listen to tacticle feedback from employees
Imature product developement process
Limited growth potential
Advice: With over 1/2 of the engineering population leaving the company over the last 1.5 years, it would be apparent that something is not working. Launch delays and frustrated employees are a direct result of micro-management without the skills and knowledge to be able to execute a developement program. Most of those who have left were tired of being ignored and undervalued while watching schedules slip further and further to the right.
Pros: Strong cultural beliefs
Strong science community

Cons: Career advancement is limited. It is a highly hierarchical company and "who you know" often is more important than what your know. Upper management is a bit detached from working realities, and middle management stymies many opportunities for improvement.
Advice: Find ways to better tap the wealth of creativity and knowledgeat the lower levels of the organization. Understand that there is a lot of "smoke and screens" at the middle management level used to protect the status quo. Note also, being in an FDA-regulated environment does not necessitate the burdensome internal bureaucracy that Roche carries - find ways to cut red tape!
Pros: Industry leader on several fronts. Upper management trying to adopt continuous improvement. Very well-educated and professionally knowledgeable employees.

Cons: I worked for Roche for 14 years and other than the last 5-6 years it was a great company.  My advice is if  you are working for Roche in the IT area, you are at risk of yearly stress of losing your job due to restructuring and sending jobs around the company/world.  In the past 6 years, my job was impacted 4-5 times.   I had to either apply for a new job or take a package and leave.  All of these were due to OPEX realignment of personnel.  Senior management would move head count from one location to another without always understanding what they were doing.  The latest push in the US is to send IT to Genentech in CA, Madrid, Spain or back to Basel, Switzerland.  The Nutley location was closed down after 100 years of service and the US headquarters shifted to Genentech.    

The merger of Roche and Genentech has not been the smoothest.  Each company is still a separate entity and supported by different IT departments.  

Genentech has not experienced the headcount loss experience as of my last day.  They are in for a shock once it does.    You have to keep in mind that Roche is the typical Swiss based company, and Gene is the typical San Francisco company.  They are on completely opposite sides of the spectrum.    Roche is extremely process driven, cost conscious (with regards to IT) and doesn't like to deviate.  Gene is agile and flexible with the mentality of "get the work done as quick as possible."  They don't let cost act as barrier necessarily.  Gene is able to bypass process and make their internal customers happy with rapid turn around times.  This is the direction Roche is trying to go but with processes still in the picture.
Advice: Stop with the constant reorganizations.  Once we finally get everything working again, there is another change and efficiency is lost again.
Pros: Good benefits for all Roche employees.  
Highly competitive salaries with bonus and depending on your level, stock options.  
They do a great job of providing top notch healthcare, dental, 401k matching and so forth. 
They value personal time and all the managers I had were great to work for except one (he is no longer with the company).  
I would still be with the company if they didn't shut down the location I was at.  
Each time I was impacted by a restructured job,  I was able to get a 10% retention bonus for my stress (you would get it if you stayed to your end date as well).
Very good severance package when large groups are impacted.

Cons: Micro-Managed. Constant upper-level changes.  Poor communication between marketing, sales, and support with customers. Division changes every few years.  Slow growth potential and opportunities. Lay-offs.
Advice: Stop investing in "better customer interaction," and focus on communication between each group/division.  Take notice of aspirational employees and seek to assist them, in their growth.  Truly listen to your ground employees. Stop making changes for customer experience based on what you believe will benefit them. Talk with your front-line support teams who interact with customers daily and listen to their advice.
Pros: PTO,  Health benefits, 401k matching, decent salaries. I've also worked with some great managers and individuals here.

Cons: Global company takes forever to make a decision.  Layer upon layer or bureaucracy, red tape, and politics.  Too many slogans and cheer leading sessions and not enough of management taking action on employees' requests.
Advice: don't just pay lip service to caring for your employees.  Actually listen to them and you can find out that many have great ideas and are valuable beyond a warm body.
Pros: Global company with deep pockets and some very smart people in R&D.  Most people I worked with were pleasant and wanted to do the right thing.  Decent benefits.  Mostly a secure place.

Cons: Genentech views Roche diagnostics as nonrelevant. Roche diagnostics middle
Management is a joke and more focused on micromanagement, politics, and territorial bureaucracy. This company continues to promote toxic managers who roll over dedicated employees for the sake of ‘agile’ workflows. Most middle managers are all out for themselves and will backstab you any chance they get to make themselves look better and positioning themselves for any political maneuver.
Advice: Remove toxic leadership who have a record of complaints for employees.  Listen more to those on the front lines and don’t promote based on what gets done but on how they are doing their jobs.  Having extensive collateral damage should not be a sign of agility.   When employees complain or seek help - listen.  And help those move to other opportunities.
Pros: East Bay large pharma/diagnostics company affiliates with Genentech

Cons: Management needed to communicate more efficiently and it was very unfortunate that with the site closure, a lot of employees were dissatisfied with the communications regarding the events leading up to the closure.
Advice: The employees are basically the engine of the company. A little more consideration would have been much appreciated and would've made the transition so much easier.
Pros: Roche Palo Alto had such a beautiful campus. Most importantly, the company had intelligent, hard working, and pleasant employees which made it so easy to come to work everyday. Roche offers careers across the U.S. and around the world for people with passion who are looking for great satisfaction and great reward from their work.

Cons: Some projects with sound scientific and business basis killed by upper management personnel turnover.  Radical and too frequent shifts in research focus is wasteful of financial and human investment in projects.  Became difficult to obtain mature research goals.
Advice: Think long and hard before making radical changes.  Seeing hard won discoveries and results go into the vault prematurely is hard on staff morale and dedication.
Pros: Great work environment.  Projects are well supported and properly equipped.  Great colleagues to work with.  Pay is good and good work is often recognized.  Projects are well developed and interesting.  Mid management is good over all.

Cons: The flip side of being part of a huge organization is that disconnects do occur. There are times that global processes and policies are applied, even when they don't fit.
Advice: Keep doing what you are doing. It's a fantastic place to work, and much of that is the result of having a leadership team who truly cares about the people of the company
Pros: Highly engaged employees who are making a difference in the community and the world. Opportunities for leadership outside of your area, with a parent company that truly cares about their employees. The benefits of both a start-up and a large organization, with a phenomenal benefit package.

Cons: Dishonest, big on lip service, poor on follow through even if they expect it from the folks in the field, corporate greed, lots of posturing, typical Nazi stereotype...all at Roche
Advice: Grow some.  Integrity is sexy, concepts such as honor, character and ethics are sorely lacking at the top.  We did in the field as we saw above at the corporate office.
Pros: I worked my own hours, I produced as I saw fit, as long as I produced they left me alone.  all in all in was an ideal job for a top producer and someone as driven as me.  I couldn't have asked for a better career, until the industry went south.

Cons: U.S. Diagnostics is disconnected from customers, and often most expensive supplier.  who you know is far more important than what you can do!  If you are field-based, virtually zero chance of transition to corporate role unless you live in Indy area.  Touts creativity and contribution, but dominated by small-minded managers who think paying your dues involves sucking up shamelessly.  If you interview, prepare a brag book and a 30-60-90 plan, or stay home.
Advice: Hire & promote people who will move the company forward rather than protect the status quo.
Pros: excellent benefits, good products, generally nice people.  Well-respected and a number of leading, innovative products.

Cons: typical corporate red tape and they are VERY conservative and stuck in their ways.  There is little visibility to senior leaders.  I do not think I have seen a senior leader in person one time except for my division head and he is very rare to see
Advice: Come roam among your people (the analysts, line workers, etc.)
Pros: You are helping the end user live a better lift.  They have great benefits.  One of the few companies that have a pension plan.  Most of the people are nice.  I feel it is a changing organization right now, trying to become younger.

Cons: PhDs don't make always the best mangers.  Some Labs needed renovations.  Silo departments. From one department to another you are managed differently.  Taking over Genentech messed up a great legacy.  Worst was the big lie of making nutely a research center and then closing the site. Roche as a company lost a lot of my respect.
Advice: Take a course in human ethics
Pros: Great science and vision. Great balance of new talent and legacy folks.  You could learn as much as you wanted.  Benefits are top. Compensation great.   Worked with some great talent. Some of the management was ok. The true workers great people.

Cons: Hard to move up since you are supposedly in charge of your own career...until your area reorganizes and you get a new boss, and then the company tells you your new path. Hard to get into management unless you are technical, and technical people are not always great managers.
Advice: Stop "Peter Principling" and promote the right type of people to management roles. Train managers in how to manage and motivate.  Stop expecting people to manage their own careers if you're not going to let them.
Pros: Great benefits, good pay, founder is still involved and continues to inspire, new president is great addition.

Cons: Size and complexity can be challenging.  Individuals can be lost in the "crowd".  The messaging is right but implementation and outcomes are not always achievable.   Direction changes rapidly resulting in unfinished initiatives and frustration.  International perspectives along with regulatory and compliance differences can be seen as roadblocks to success.
Advice: Revisit the Roche culture.  Increase internal awareness of all Roche customer related initiatives across all divisions.   Improve horizontal and vertical internal communications among all divisions and employees.
Pros: Large international company offering diverse employment and growth opportunities.  Employee support and benefits are comprehensive and equally available for field and home campus employees.  Resources critical for employee success provided and supported.  Personal development encouraged.

Cons: Pay is less, does not get evaluated according to current market, even though they say so.
Advice: None
Pros: Flexibility and work-life balance. Good culture and teams and people are great to work with.

Cons: They're no longer converting contingent staff. The culture there is dissipating. No longer innovative. Products are subpar and being pushed into the market with low quality.  Company doesn't care about you and it shows. One word I would use to describe the company is 'uninspired.'
Advice: Take a management course training. Understand that people come first.
Pros: Work/life balance is good here. Lots of amazing scientists and engineers. It's a shame they're not being recognized for their exceptional work and potential. People are trickling out, as they should in an atmosphere that doesn't propel you in a positive direction.

Cons: Leadership doesn't seem to be engaged and is more concerned about protecting their friends, the their current positions.  The management seems to be unconcerned about the success of the Life Sciences group.
Advice: Life Science division leadership should be held to the same standards as leadership in Diagnostics division.  Because they are not, the sales staff is demoralized and most, if not all, are looking into alternative opportunities.  A common phase; "I'm looking to move to a position in Diagnostics".
Pros: Layoffs are frequent with the Life Science group, with 5 occurring in my 8 years at this company.  Layoffs mostly focus on those earning the most, at their given pay level, and not on quality of work.

Cons: Inflexible and old-fashioned HR and career development policies, processes, procedures. Relatively slow growth - limited upward career growth opportunities. Inconsistent hiring practices - quality of many mid- to high- level managers is far from norm in the area. Slow, risk averse, politically charged culture. Lack of domain knowledge expertise on many key levels.
Advice: Benchmark from the best companies in the area, including divisions / companies within the group. Take accountability - ownership of key projects, adjust incentives to match common practices in organizations attracting top talent
Pros: Relaxed atmosphere, easy commute, decent brand name. Consensus driven culture, ability to do lateral moves, grow within, stable organization and good upper management

Cons: politics between departments can sometimes hamper work. Bureaucracy is high and sometimes its tough to make long term employees to accept newer ways of doing things.
Advice: separate technical management and operational management.
Pros: exciting products, challenging project work. A company with a very good growth rate..looks promising for future career growth. Lot of products in pipeline ensuring job stability. company has been around for a long time so well set processes.teams are very competent.. senior management is very good at taking note of good work, encouraging fresh ideas. Overall a great work environment. benefits are very good especially for those with kids and families. Employee retention is high

Cons: Product development was much, much too slow especially for the research market which was initially targeted. This was due to inappropriate company processes rather than to any deficiency in the R&D capabilities, in my opinion, and it caused the company to get clobbered by the competition even though we were first on market with a NGS platform. BTW, Chris McLeod is no longer CEO; Thomas Shinecker has been CEO since late 2011 / early 2012.
Advice: I'm afraid it's too late for that, and it seems to be their call too...
Pros: Great people, compensation and benefits are excellent too. Technology is (was) cool and some applications remain competitive.

Cons: Roche failed to invest sufficiently or understand this fast growing market, so they failed to use the talent present to develop another technology to keep them in the game.  2014 they will turn off the lights and start over in SF.
Advice: Focus on taking market share in the US, where the money is, while leveraging European and Asian presence to increase sales.  Understand that the the next-gen sequencing industry is faster moving than any other technical industry.  3 years is a millennium, 5 years is an eon.
Pros: Great work environment, emphasis on good leadership, focus on developing staff, really smart people

Cons: Management is not honest, to the point where it isn't a personal critque but rather something that's just understood by the greater workforce.  Extraordinarly little diversity for a company in this sector, very unfortunate..
Advice: Listen to your employees, share information with people.  Workforce is tired of being managed by a person not on site, worrying about cuts they know are coming but aren't allowed to mention, etc.
Pros: Atmosphere and dedicated workforce are both big positives.  Having an aging workforce that cares greatly about the work being done highlights how important the work is, but also highlights how little management cares.

Cons: Roche sometimes make confusing decisions without explaining why they are to the employees. It is what happens in any large organization but can get frustrating at times.
Advice: None
Pros: Core to their belief is believing in patients. Each local site may have different cultures but they all work together to drive Roche's mission. Diagnostics and Pharma divisions are pretty different from one another. I specifically worked at Roche Molecular Solutions, which is made up of three different business units. Each business unit is unique in its own way, with its pros and cons, but it seems like management has a good vision on what they want to do with this

Cons: - TD have taken over Roche US. Leadership does not practice what they preach about being in position too long and needing to move on. NADEC is clueless and just "yes" people .
Advice: The One Roche approach is ruining what is left of a once great company.
Pros: - Once a premier Diagnostics Company. Not any longer with the infiltration of the new TD culture.

- One Roche is doing the direct opposite of what it was intended by killing the morale of the workforce and weakening customer loyalty.

- Heavy back door processes and procedures takes over one month to generate a pricing proposal

- Marketing only manages inventory. They do not monitor competition, nor communicate strategy. Allocations and quality issues across all franchises is making the company suffer. No one is addressing issues.

Cons: A promotion takes a long time and depends on being given highly visible projects in terms of scope (e.g., global) and funding (&gt;$1M).  Few people get the opportunity to deliver, thereby justifying a promotion.  The process of advancing drug candidates through the pipeline has not been transparent, although the name and number of candidates are published internally.
Advice: Empower the people with roles, responsibilities, and funding.
Pros: Hoffmann-La Roche is a company with good values.  They advocate "Do the Right Thing".  People are placed in positions where they can contribute and also advance in their career.  The information system portfolio process is transparent.

Cons: Roche/Genentech is a very large organization and that can be challenging for individuals.  There is the potential to have to work global hours with colleagues.  The market place is maturing with increasing competition and pressures.
Advice: Roche/Genentech can continue to follow the science and bring focus to patients.  Find opportunities to create innovative and creative environments with smaller collocated teams.
Pros: Roche/Genentech has a strong mission.  Employees have many global opportunities with lots of ways to develop and grow.  There is a good focus on people.  The pipeline of products is strong.  There is an environment of play hard and work hard.

Cons: Advancement impossible unless you’re  a pet, previous success gets you hired but then  doesn’t count, too focused on short-term financials, company built and operated around most expensive/longest sale-cycle product line and expects everyone else—who would be with the “right products” if they were any good—to prop it up, WAY too much shuffling of deck chairs because too many middle managers who don’t know what they’re doing
Advice: Stop promoting inexperienced suck-ups over people who actually know what they’re doing.  “Customer-focus” means focus-on-your-customer, not extract-every-penny-of-profit-from-them
Pros: Awesome benefits, good salary, very smart people

Cons: Difficult company to work for. Career advancement is very difficult to achieve. Business systems such as data, pricing and contracting are a mess with home grown solutions. Work processes are not efficient, lean or employee empowered. Management levels are professional meeting attenders and accomplish very little in terms of tangible results.
Advice: Work culture is a lot worse than many outside the company think with a lot of corporate red tape.  There is a “rising star” and “young professionals” group of employees that get exemptions made for many standards and policies others have to abide by.
Pros: Good health benefits and mission to help patient lives.

Cons: Being an American, it is always difficult working for a company that although it recognizes the US as the largest market for selling its products, does not respect our marketing or marketing research.  Working for this Swiss-German owned company, the US group is treated like a distributor, that because of our size they have to put up with.  When products are not designed to specifications as originally agreed upon, well the rest of the world doesn't need that feature, so why does the US?  If there is a product problem, it is always because the US customer did not use it correctly.  If a launch date is delayed by Germany, it is ok, but if US sales are below plan due to that product not being available, too bad!

As a product manager - middle manager, you had to make every effort to get along with your global counter parts, who at the middle level were decent folks, but had little leverage.  But they might be able to help with back orders or push for one specification over another.  There were a lot of politics and you had to be involved enough to know channels on both sides of the ocean.

Concerning the 300 R& D employees who lost their jobs because their jobs would be hired in Germany - Fishers, IN should raise the taxes that Roche pays locally.  Then Roche laid off 250 more people in 2008 from Indianapolis, many who had been with the company over 15 years.  Tillman made it clear in company townhall meetings that these layoffs were because the company needed more profit out the Indianapolis corporation.
Advice: For now, in the current market, you will keep employees out of fear.  if the plan for 2009 is not met, is it the end for you?  Based on the low market growth, few new products that Roche is offering in 2009, you are running on fear.   Does Roche care about customers or just making the 2009 sales plan?  What legacy are you leaving?  What reputation will customers remember?
Pros: The quality and integrity of the colleagues that you work with.  Many people have been with the company for a long time - look in the parking lot at all of the 25 year signs, this is a tribute to the loyalty to the company.  These people hold knowledge and experience that cannot be replaced with a few weeks of training.
Having the opportunity to work with new and innovative products, to be able to move to different divisions and learn new processes and businesses - was encouraged.  You are able to grow in your position by taking on new projects or moving on to other areas, such as moving between sales and marketing, from service to sales.  People who were achievers in one area were given an opportunity to move to other areas, such as moving from customer service management to technical service management.  The change and diversity of ideas seemed to add positive energy.

Cons: - Departments and teams seem to be restructured at least annually.  Upper management's continual shifts in focus and strategy are stressful for employees.
- Company says they value innovation, but in terms of business processes, management and many individual employees appear to have difficulty accepting new ideas or changes to existing processes.  There is a tangible fear of doing things differently, and it can take months or years to get a project completed.
- While company is beginning to take steps to promote employee career development, it is difficult to get a promotion in some departments.  Going above and beyond your job description, and doing outstanding work, aren't enough.  If you aren't perceived as management material and playing into the politics, it can be tough to move out of your current position.
- Company is making attempts to increase diversity at highest levels of leadership, but still has a long way to go.  Company's top executives are all middle-aged white men.  
- Managers and higher levels spend far too much time in meetings and seem disconnected from day-to-day business and their teams, as a result.
Advice: - Stop restructuring departments and teams so often.  Give things a chance to work before you start changing everything again.
- Recognize that not all employees have the traditional business 'get-ahead' temperament (and that includes many of your top individual contributors).  Provide career development, lateral role mobility and non-management promotion opportunities for these employees, too - not just those that will be moving up the ladder into management ranks.  Otherwise, you're going to lose them after they get frustrated and burned out.
Pros: - Excellent vacation, medical and retirement benefits, including domestic partner benefits
- Opportunity to work with highly intelligent colleagues who produce quality results
- Company makes genuine effort to be environmentally and socially responsible
- Company and their products are well-respected
- Opportunity for performance sharing bonuses (depending upon department and role)
- Company provides nice perks for employees at work-sponsored events and outings
- Business casual attire in many departments, with casual Fridays

Cons: Operations management has adopted a Dickensian attitude towards the workers and staff.  Not a very pleasant work environment, almost no chance for advancement or raises, no bonuses below scientist level but helltopay if the quota isn't met by department and if that means you'll pull long (uncompensated ) days to hit their bonus numbers... oh well.  Overall &gt;very unimpressive.
Starting the structural organizational dissassembly of the franchise that is pretty typical of big pharma.
Advice: None
Pros: Job with benefits in Tucson, nice overall facility, coworkers in departments outside of Operations (manufacturing) seem to be much happier and more or less content.

Cons: Poor mid to upper management (never get the feeling they are being up-front and honest, merely a speaker phone to their managers)
Inter-office politics are extremely bad
Poor structure of management (ie one person responsible for projects, but not a direct manager of the employees working on the project) leads to inefficient decision making and accountablility
Advice: None.  The site is being divested from the Roche network and will probably be restructured soon with another company or, however unlikely, shut down.
Pros: Great benefits
Great pay for the cost of living of the area
Good work/life balance (this is direct manager dependant, however)
Decent opportunity for career advancement

Cons: Expected to work long hours as a salaried employee without additional compensation. But, if you need time for personal matters you have to use vacation time. They treat you like you work on a production line. 

Managers disappear for days without informing their direct reports. Can't be found when needed.
Advice: No real advice since the Nutley facility is being closed down. Realize you have talented employees that want to do the best but mid-management gets in the way. They are afraid their direct reports might come up with something better than they can.
Pros: Flexible hours. But no trust in employees. If you try to work remotely they will not let you but your managers will do so as they please.

Cons: Competitive market means rapid, 4 year development cycles. QC, QA and Manufacturing are on the East coast and Research, Development, Marketing, Business Development, Regulatory and  the Administrative center are in Pleasanton which makes maintaining good communication important.
Advice: You will increase efficiency and have more product success if you listen to your lower staff's suggestions
Pros: Good work environment. Good product ideas. Staff work together to meet goals. Has large parent company, Roche, for support. Good benefits. Intelligent staff.

Cons: Pleasanton campus has a long way to go when it comes to innovation.  The culture is ultra conservative and archaic management styles.  They don't know how to move past their own egos for the success of the company.  The management needs to learn to be inclusive and respect all levels of employees.  They don't lead by example and HR is doing their best to make changes to the culture, however, they are very slow in doing so.
Advice: Really listen to your employees and support them and guide them where they need to be.  Be transparent about your initiatives and give valuable feedback with a goal to attain.
Pros: Benefits and helping patients achieve healthcare goals

Cons: The health benefits (for Adecco) are not what they could be, which had I known it before, I probably would have looked someplace else. The pay is reasonable, but healthcare benefits are lacking.
Advice: Make yourself more available to the "average" employee. Interactions with management are great and they facilitate an environment of growth, but upper management is rarely seen.
Pros: The workplace environment is one that benefits the employees. Every now and then, fun activites are planned to promote the employees well-being, such as fundraisers, pitch-ins and more. Overall, it is a great place to work.

Cons: There are a lot of "lifers" at Roche, people who have spent 20+ years with the organization - and it shows.  Fresh ideas and approaches are slow to take hold and management has very long memories, making overcoming mistakes that are bound to happen as your career progresses very difficult.   I've seen folks stalled even when they had strong advocates because of some impression that was made 7 or 8 years in the past.

Also, with the lifers, sometimes career advancement gets stiffled at a certain level.  I saw "manager ready" folks compete over and over against other lifers for single management positions, some taking 5+ years to get into a spot, even though they were quite talented.

Roche is a huge organization - with a lot of links to other US and Global organizations.  Reporting relationships and matrixing is on overload at times and who has the ability to make a decision can be very confusing.  The amount of people that have to "get aligned" to get something done is astonishing - which is why in virtually every area EXCEPT R&D, the company is way behind global competitors in process and technology (Finance, IT, HR, Customer Support, etc).  You will work hard - especially if you are salaried, as there is always more to do and arbitrary timelines to hit than there are resources to get it done.
Advice: Let go of the past and be willing to take more risks.  Don't be so afaid of failure that you don't even try - especially with people.  Growth and development is really cut short when good people are let go for risk taking or making mistakes that are non-critical to the business.  Recognize that most people are giving you everything they have - and when they hit a roadblock, try giving them something back in the way of compassion and grace - instead of showing them the door.  Stay engaged so irritants don't become problems, because when you do come down to earth and notice it - you feel your only options are drastic when earlier engagement could have prevented many problems.  Don't be afraid of authenticity when you see it.
Pros: Benefits and overall compensation are very competitive, especially at the manager level.  There are a lot of dedicated and talented people at Roche, many who are loyal, hard-working and will do whatever it takes to get the job done.

The investment in people is beginning in earnest in terms of their development, growth and getting to an authentic workplace where issues get vetted (but the lifers sometimes get in the way).

Cons: Lean manufacturing, diversity and inclusion gone awry. Traditional habit of hiring and promoting people based on how well they are liked instead of how well they perform.
Advice: Identify your five hardest working people and reward them for it with long term pay and benefits. Identify five people who no one would notice if they didn't show up for a week and allow them to pursue other interests.
Pros: Globally recognized name and status. Funding for huge projects, unlimited resources. Excellent pay and benefits. Willing to pay for out of area learning and travel.

Cons: Management is a joke! They have this brotherhood, and they play around with people. No career oriented, and going with the flow, they do what the director (in his/her little kingdom) thinks its right, and not what would be best for the company.
Advice: Careful.. When Basel finds out the mess you guys and HR are doing here, that wont be nice...
Pros: People are friendly, very professional, and the benefits are awesome!

Cons: While the pay and benefits are amazing, it appears that the growth trajectory at Roche can be limited. This is a beloved company and many people work there 10, 20, even 40 years. With people working there so long, it makes it very difficult to move up (based on my observations)
Advice: None
Pros: They make me feel wanted and welcomed at Roche. My coworkers treat me as a true colleague (even though I'm an intern) and are just as excited to learn from me as I am from them.

Cons: Location is in Branchburg, NJ so you need a car.  Train station is close by but too far to walk from.
Advice: Focus more on development of your employees and recognizing your employees.
Pros: So long as you do your work and participate in ways to make things better, you will feel very valued.  There are nice perks like free coffee all day and the ability to work flexible hours so long as they are discussed with your manager.  There is a genuine feeling of everyone working towards the goal of us having great products with great quality.

Cons: Tries to look like a fair and good company, but actions taken are usually for the business profits made by company, with less concern for employees. Politics and personal gains dictates most decisions at a manager - employee level, decreasing motivation from employee’s side.
Advice: Try to be in each employee’s shoes and help the bright and smart people to want to stay in this company.
Pros: Big company with good benefits, has good long term strategy. Ability to buy new companies that adds to scientific strategy.

Cons: Everything was very traditional, especially the cubical environment I worked in. It was very much a 'clock in, clock out' culture. The size of the company made it difficult to get things done without going up a fairly sizable chain of command.
Advice: Management should try to engage with employees a bit more. Those I worked with seemed overworked, so it was understandably tough for them to socialize much.
Pros: The pay was very competitive, the Indianapolis site has many nice facilities, and many employees had been working there for several years. There was a since of loyalty and security with the company.

Cons: Constant change over the 18 months
Lack of trust in the direction current senior leadership is taking the company
Very top-down driven culture with rules that are changing almost daily
Advice: Slow down a little -  you've got good people, but you are not "really" asking them for input.  Basic change management principles instruct a genuine feeling of ownership is necessary for true buy-in and lasting organizational change.
Pros: Products that help people's lives (you want your family, or family doctor, to use them)
Brand recognition (mostly from pharma and the retail glucose monitors)
Public company with the ability to make long-term investments (a rarity these days)

Cons: gRED has an air of superiority over pRED, and its no fun being on the pRED side.
Advice: pRED and gRED have very different cultures.  Cannot directly compare the two organizations or their productivity, without changing management styles.
Pros: Roche is a fantastic company to work for, but a lot depends on whether you are pRED or gRED.  As far as salary, benefits and treating employees with respect, it is a wonderful place. There are enough opportunities for everyone to do well, grow and be rewarded.

Cons: Patented products expired.  Susceptible to the competition of generic medications.
Advice: None
Pros: Proactive, Employee (called Associates) Oriented, Education, Professional Development and Training Opportunities, Pleasant working environment and camaraderie among staff at all levels, Participatory Management/Open door policy,  Sponsored free family oriented events for staff and family and on-site special events for staff.  Mission Focus and Quality Control.  Employee policy manual and HR Department available.  Dispensary, gym, walking route, parking within premises.  I got greatly exposed to Pharmaceutical/Manufacturing good practices, SOPs, FDA policies and Audits, etc.  One of my best working experiences.

Cons: Speaking of slow, everything moves slowly like how the grand canyon was made.  Parking is getting very challenging.  Benefits are worse than ever, co-pays are 10-20x than they use to be.  Even the talent during the spring concert this year was sub par.
Advice: It's ok for peers to help others.  You may let them take their blinders off.
Pros: Nice gym.   There are career opportunities available with great managers.  But you also need a good HR person.  Otherwise, it's like working with a dead white ancient pine tree.

Cons: Roche is very bureaucratic and slow moving company. The Swiss culture certainly is visible and most decsions are taken centrally after months of discussions. While top management is OK, the next level of management in the headquarter is of mixed competence. The recent Genentaech announcement is a downer.
Advice: Take a close look at the various levels of management in the organziation in the headquarter. There is a clear lack of inspirational abilities.
Pros: Roche is a very Successful company, compared to all the other pharma corporations out there in the world. the drug pipeline looks promising, espceially with all the Genentech stuff.

Cons: As a customer service associate, the job becomes very repetitive when you are on the phone for 8 hours straight.
Advice: I really do not have advice for management, as the only downside is the repetitive nature of the position.  This cannot be fixed, and the selection process must obtain people who are willing to work this type of position.
Pros: Management is very concerned with employee personal and career development.  They take time each month to discuss your career goals, and give you advice on how to reach them.  They also proactively make connections with people in those fields to try and give you exposure.

Cons: Advancement is based on a who you know basis.  Your hard work better be extra special if you want to get notice because if you do great work and "joe' does good work, "joe" will get the position cause he knows "BILL"
Advice: Upper Management is great!  These guys are always improving and making things happen with the company to encourage growth and employment.  Its the people who are in supervision positions with the egos.
Pros: Benefits are excellent.  I am sure they are one of the best in the company.  Lot of different opportunities available for growth

Cons: Very "clubby" upper management so playing politics necessary.  Lots of re-organization across many business areas very disruptive.  Pharma rules the roost as Dia is definitely the "little brother".
Advice: Practice what you preach with respect to all the Cultural Values.  Keep investing in tools and resources for employees.  Break down the wall between upper management and the rank and file.
Pros: HIgh quality products that work well.  Corporate Roche investing in the future.  PHC is key to overall company strategy and well positioned.  Leveraging Dxn and Rx for differentiation in lab market.  Roche provides employees with the resources needed to succeed.

Cons: Local management did not communicate well with their direct reports.  There also seemed to be a lack of respect for people (such as administrative assistants) who did support work.
Advice: Talk to the people who work for you.  They are on your side.   Treat the people who were in place before you started as well as your own hires.
Pros: great benefits, access  to experts in many fields, opportunity to work with people from around the world, commitment to doing things right and creating a world class product.  The CEO of Roche global is one of the most inspiring speakers/leaders whom I have ever met.

Cons: The culture is competitive, fear-driven, & cutthroat.  The Indy HQ is essentially just a sales office for the global product teams.  Glorified used car dealers.  The global teams hold most of the critical actions and decisions.
Advice: Beware the cult of personality and the agenda of the attention-seeking.  Listen to your customers.  Hold marketing accountable and set their bonus on the sales dollars/targets for the year.
Pros: Most things from a corporate standpoint are done 'by the book'.  Roche doesn't cut corners.  The structure of the organization is solid, and most of the Sr Leadership

Cons: Leadership at the VP level did not align with the people doing the work. They come up with ideas that just don't work in the real world. A lot of layers and red tape. Hard to get anything done without going up multiple layers. Lacks innovation. A lot of clicks and playing favorites. Also a lot of arguing between leaders and then putting their people in the middle of the situation- very uncomfortable.
Advice: Get down to the layer of the people doing the work and ask their opinions and then listen.
Pros: Awesome benefits. Great cause- you know why you get up every day. Passion

Cons: They keep the carrot and hit you over the head with the stick.  In 6 years with the company I saw lawsuit after lawsuit by employees and vendors.  Roche has the attitude that they're too big to lose a lawsuit, so they basically enter into contracts and, after getting what they want, they walk away from their end. 

Most co-workers complain that Management approaches them with promises of promotions if they add extra work and assignments.  After the Managers get what they want, there're no promotions.  

Another common practice is that you can't "resign."  Many, many ex-employees have found that they can't use Roche as a reference because, when you resign, HR puts "Terminated" on your record.   Roche is so paranoid of employees going to the competition or a vendor that they trash your record to keep you from finding another job.   This is begging for a class-action lawsuit.

Each month our department sent an e-mail with the names of employees no longer allowed on the premises and that security should be notified if they were seen.  Each month there were at least 3 new names.  It got to the point of absurdity.  Whether those employees were fired, or resigned and then labeled as having been fired is unclear.  But with what we knew of HR's practice of labeling all ex-employees as having been fired, it really crashed moral.
Advice: Well, you guys seem to have everything in the bag.  You're the problem for your employees and you don't care about them.
Pros: You meet a lot if good-natured people with positive attitudes, but only untill they realize that promised opportunities were just carrots on a stick to get something out of them.  In our division there were few people left with more than 8-10 years experience.  That seemed to be the point where employees gave up trying to work with management and left.  You could see people's demeaner and attitude change the longer the were with us.

Cons: bad cafe foods
tasks over-predefined and no more room to apply advanced programming skills
doing some silly programming jobs most of the time by just clicking the buttons with minimum debugging info
too many TC, especially early morning TC for employee in USA
some first-line managers are really bad at managing people, always discouraging or distracting their hardworking employee even when they got a task done with surprisingly good results. Maybe those managers are pessimistic and under pressure thus make the team as unhappy as her/him
Advice: When the first-line manager's boss is in Europe, it is very easy for the first-line manager to hide a lot of problems locally. Please connect with the employee directly.
Pros: Big name company in the pharma field
Lots of training chances and materials if you are willing to learn
nice office and location

Cons: Sr. Management is very sleazy and nonstop pathological lying is the culture.  They will push subpar/incomplete products out the door only to collect bonus $$ - then spend $$ millions having to redo or correct critical design errors ultimately taking years to correct.

Work/Life balance is nonexistent and travel requirements are significantly higher than competitive /peer companies.

Leadership style is "fear" based --  "Lie to customers or be fired" is the SOP


RMD should be considered an embarrassment to Roche Holdings in terms of integrity.
Advice: Stop the pathological lying
Stop pushing products out the door that will fail for the first 3 years or more until fixed or finished
Pros: This is specific to RMS - the Roche Pleasanton location.

None

Cons: Peoples lives were turned upside down when Genentech was purchased.  Everyone in Nutley was fired and campus closed.  The company that they bought got all the best jobs and high pay.  Didn't make sense to anyone.
Advice: Nothing to say.  It happens more and more in big pharma.  People just out for themselves. Loyalty and honor no longer exist. It's all about money.
Pros: Ability to gain diverse experience.  Pushed to learn and grow.  School was highly recommended for everyone and conveniently brought on campus.  Many clubs, activities, celebrations, fun for all.

Cons: The Nanopore project in Santa Clara is a highly toxic environment that has led to a lot of infighting and blaming of one another. You are punished if you do not accept the current dogma and any new scientific results that contradict will be repressed. There is no accountability of the projects leading to incentive for most employees to do above the bare minimum to keep their jobs.
Advice: None
Pros: Stable employer, good benefits, and decent COVID19 response

Cons: Unfair promotions (or luck there off), very low salary increase even to the best performers.  Poor dissemination of important information from the top down.  Very political in some departments.
Advice: Please share information -- you'll get more committed employees, who's decisions would be more educated.  Share knowledge across sites -- there is so much lost with Palo Alto closing.
Pros: Great benefits (maternity leave, vacation, retirement plan) package.  A good place to learn new skills, a lot of knowledge in R&D.  Beautiful campus.

Cons: Compensation package below the market average.
Life Science Division in state of flux for last 3-4 years.
Advice: Roche is a well-known and established organization in the healthcare sector. Diagnostics Division has seen great advancements in technology fueled by a number of acquisitions. Life Science Division is the smallest division yet the most volatile in regards to reorganizations.
Pros: Forbes Top 100 for Best Places to work in the USA. Overall, good senior leadership in ever-changing and challenging environment. Promote a positive organizational culture
and focus on the customer. Very positive experience when it comes to work life and family life. Solid Benefits package.

Cons: Although benefits & pay are great it does not make up for the poorly lacking leadership in this location.  There are many leaders who allow & ignore bad behaviors by their employees or who they themselves do not support a culture of teamwork and innovative thinking their employees so desperately crave.  They rely on out dated and unorganized processes.  They do not represent the culture of the many companies they acquire, although they will take the credit.
Advice: If you can’t change your leadership teams thinking to embrace innovative and a teamwork environment, please look for leaders who do embrace this culture and openness for teamwork.
Pros: Great benefits and pay.  New building in this location

Cons: Low efficiency, low accountability, low bars in competency and quality of work. Too many managers per one engineer.  Open floor work place is counterproductive for software engineering.
Advice: Bring compensation in line with Bay Area  best companies. Drastically reduce manager/engineer ratio. Get rid off open plan work paces in favor in offices for permanent staff and cubes for contractors
Pros: Work processes are well-organized. Premises are very clean. Facilities are nicely managed. Relaxed and friendly atmosphere.

Cons: As with most companies, the only way to advance in the research side of the company beyond your degree is to either step on a lot of toes or transfer to a non-research position (referred to as a lateral promotion).  The company will pay your tuition if you wish to get an advanced degree, but you have do it on your own time, and you must get a degree related to your current position (no getting an MBA for the scientists).

A method for saving money (which is industry-wide) is to outsource many of the jobs to contractors in order to avoid paying for benifits.  Roche is guilty of this and it makes those in facilities maintenence very bitter and hard to work with.
Advice: Roche needs to concentrate on the company that is has, and avoid purchasing other's intellectual property.  And the fear that the company's Chinese startups instills in it's US and European workers is real and should be noted, or Roche will become another victim of low morale in this age of outsourcing.
Pros: The Nutley, NJ site of Hoffmann-La Roche is one of the original US sites of the Basel-based pharmaceutical and it still maintains "Family-owned" roots (as compared to Roche sites that became part of the company when purchased or aquired).  Roche enjoys including its employees in the success of the company to the end that even non-managment employees are given a bonus based on not only their performance, but the company's as well.

Senior researchers (PhDs) and junior researchers (BS/MS) are very friendly with each other and often socialize together during breaks (which are almost mandatory) and lunch.  And the exchange of knowledge and assistance between all researchers regardless of level is free and friendly.

Roche's greatest feature is the low occurrence of layoffs.  They do happen, but not very often.  Roche is a stable place to work.

Cons: Very conservative culture that doesn't encourage risk-taking, don't think management overall has progressive flexible work-life policies, management seems out of touch with needs and desires of workforce, technology not cutting-edge.
Advice: Spend more time talking and listening to the rank and file (not in organized meeting settings), develop a decent budget along with time for training and development.
Pros: Sense of purpose in working for a company that develops medicines that help people, opportunities to develop different skills, good benefits, enjoy co-workers who for the most part are motivated and engaged in their jobs.

Cons: Management very secretive about promotions and changes in staffing
Little prospects for promotion
Benefits package is subpar. 80/20 payment, high out of cost expenses for expectant parents
Permananent employees grossly underpaid. Company also relies heavily on temps to cut costs.Temps take a long time to be hired as permanent
Advice: encourage development of employees through trainings 
inform employees of future goals and their role in the changes ahead
Pros: Wonderful friendships established. The people are what keep you motivated and make the day go by!
Job stability. No layoffs since hired.

Cons: The company is very process oriented. This is really a necessity for FDA regulated companies. 
Not a Startup Culture.
Advice: Keep up the good work.
Pros: Company's mission, improving diagnostic for cancer patients, really motivates you to work harder. The leadership team has continued with the founder's passion successfully.
Competetive Salary (Even in Silicon Valley). Excellent Benefits (401k and Medical Insurance). But if earning money is your only goal you would do better to look else where.
Challenging Work. Although this is Ventana Medical, This is really a division of Roche Diagnostics, which is a behemoth of a company.

Cons: If you do not do well with change this may not be the place to work. There are frequent reorgs, not to the point of disruption, but at least once a year.
Advice: Overall Ventana is a great place to work and develop one's career. Keep providing regular feedback to your direct reports and continue to allow creativity in the workplace.
Pros: Great working environment. Good people who enjoy what they do and work well together. Hard work and initiative is recognized by management.

Cons: Only applicable for the diagnostics side but the company is really slow when it comes to considering or adopting new technology. Most if not all diagnostic R&amp;D assays utilize PCR as the reporter which makes sense since it is Roche's bread and butter. I feel like this will only limit future growth in the future for the diagnostics division.
Advice: None
Pros: The people here are nice to work with and very supportive they feel like family. Managers work with their employees to achieve career progression. Overall the work is stimulating.

Cons: Those who have been at the company a long time are perhaps at a level of responsibility that is above their ability.
Advice: Making mature decisions in product development is the best way to protect future business growth. Downsizing product features to meet a deadline will make for unhappy customers and ultimately harm the brand.
Pros: The company is growing so rapidly that those who have ability are promoted and given responsibilities commensurate to their ability level.

Cons: Due to a series of setbacks and strategic misteps, Roche has recently terminated internal development of all next generation sequencing, and laid off 2/3 of R&D. Morale is very low. No compelling new direction has been presented to the people who remain in R&D.
Advice: Management needs to respond much, much faster or more effectively when 1) strategic business partners fail to deliver 2) when tedious Roche approval processes slow down development and the ability to get time sensitive contracts signed
Pros: The chance to work with very talented engineers and scientists in a variety of fields.

Cons: However management will focus on metrics to an extreme instead of if the job is getting done, relationships are being built, patients are being helped as well as the numbers.  When positions are eliminated attempt to offer employees other positions within the company
Advice: Offer loyal employees affected by realignment other opportunities within the company even if in a different business unit.
Pros: Very good benefits. Most of your co-workers are professional and good to work with. Indianapolis campus is a nice environment as well.

Cons: (1) Difficult to advance into a manager's position, (2) Some departments are gender bias that are managed by a female, (3) When applying for an internal promotion, you are interviewed by your peers and management decision is primarily based upon the peers comments/ratings of the applicant not the managers'
Advice: Only management should conduct the interviews when promoting an employee. After all it was management's "sole" decision to hire the applicant not the peers.
Pros: Company has "the best" benefits for their employees. The pay is excellent providing your title has, analyst, supervisor and or manager attached to.

Cons: Work environment is undergoing departmental changes right now: moving from cubicles to open-concert spaces, emphasizing working outside during the day rather than inside. If you're open-minded and willing to explore a little to find your best way to work, this makes working at Roche even better. But of that kind of thing makes you unsettled or uncomfortable, you may want to look elsewhere.
Advice: None
Pros: INCREDIBLY well-organized and well-run company; the emphasis on Focus Feedback makes for an environment with really great synergy, and gives every individual an opportunity to stand out in any position.

Cons: Nanopore sequencing project in Santa Clara is the most Machiavellian company culture I have ever come across in my career. People constantly bad-mouthing each other behind their backs. No teamwork or cooperation between groups because they are all too busy pointing fingers at each other to actually solve problems that plague the platform. Any new employees that attempt to break through this culture get punished and end up living out the five monkeys experiment.
Advice: I honestly don't know - burn it all down and start over?  Looks like they recently acquired Stratos Genomics - maybe this will work out better.
Pros: Roche keeps pumping money into the nanopore sequencer project.

Cons: Management is down right stupid.  Bad decisions.  They only want profit and don't care about building share.  Bonuses are share based.
Advice: Look at what the competition is doing!!!   TV advertisting is killing us.  Get in touch with what is happening in the market and see what the competition is doing.
Pros: Flexiblity in getting work done.  Good people to work with but senior management is not in touch with realtiy or the market.

Cons: Big corporate culture. Start-up flavor lost. Moves with the agility of the USS Arizona. Technology may be losing its market luster a bit. Work harder! Vacation time is a mega downer.
Advice: The Europe to America to Goodness-Only-Knows-Where-Else 18 month management merry-go-round is a little weird. Not BAD per se, just weird. Middle-management seems to lack vision or power (or both). Upper management seems to get it, though.
Pros: The people in general are great. The R&D pipeline is fun to be involved with. The benefits package is really good.

Cons: The site management was very awful, and kept employees in the dark about site issues and problems
It seems as though the lower level employees in the company are not taken care of as well as they should be
Advice: Get to know your employees (not just the ones with doctorates), keep them in the loop, ask for their ideas, and stop wasting money on frivolous things.
Pros: Beautiful site to work on
Large budgets to work with
The company remains on the leading edge of innovation in pharmaceuticals, with new machinery and methods.

Cons: Global organization many times does not focus on development to meet the needs of the US customer. Point of Care business unit has not developed a wide array of testing platforms thus has not gained market presence as other companies.
Advice: Focus more on the US customer needs and also do a better job of proactively developing or buying technology in the point of care segment to help grow diagnostics revenue in this expanding business category.
Pros: Very stable company with great history. Had a long rewarding career. Company is very innovative especially in molecular diagnostics.

Cons: Part of the finance team is getting relocated to Costa-Rica so opportunities in Indianapolis are not for the long run. A lot of people are contractors with no chance of getting the same benefits as regular employees. It can create a lot of resentment which is sad because the company does have good values.
Advice: Reward contractors for good work with a few paid vacation days. A little can go a long way.
Pros: Great culture and benefits; the company values diversity, work/life balance, and health/well-being.

Cons: Maybe true to all big companies, some times it involves several departments to address one issue that could be well addressed by a single department.  This makes you feel efficiency needs to be improved.
Advice: Needs more diversity in middle management - not just male female ratio.  A global company needs to put more people from different culture background in leadership position.
Pros: Work life balance, good resources and talented colleagues.  Trust between management and employees are good.  Very transparent in communicating changes and what's happening in the industry.

Cons: Big company feel means that it seems that the company does not care about it employees and only worried about the bottom line. Lowest compensation of all the top diagnostic companies
Advice: Get it together. Hire the right people, not because of degree qualifications on paper but because they can do the job. Having a PhD does not mean you know how to manage.
Pros: BIg company feel, lots of benefits, with lots of products in the pipeline and job security.

Cons: In the many years I worked at Roche I witnessed the culture change from a family atmosphere to a more in-personable and disingenuous atmosphere.
Advice: The success of every company depends on the success of the employee to implement the strategic plan.  Therefore, make a sincere effort to listen to the employee's challenges and try to work a compromise where both parties win.
Pros: The people affected by the realignment are forced to look elsewhere for employment and some have found greater opportunities!  So there is life after Roche!

Cons: Management not in tuned with workers and what is really going on in the company. They need to realize that their best resource in knowing what is going on is with the people who work for them.
Advice: Follow through on the cultural commitments. Provide your employees with opportunities to grow and develop even if that means they may move to another dep.  not just talking about it but actually doing it.
Pros: Good work life balance (one of the best in the companies that I have worked for)
Collaborative atmosphere. great benefits

Cons: A few very unkind, jealous and lazy people that need to be let go. I literally had a project sabotaged by one of them. It ruined the environment for me. Such a shame because it is an amazing company to work for.
Advice: Keep up the good work!
Pros: Great benefits, talented colleagues, motivating HR department, great management and execs and projects that you can feel proud about.

Cons: There's a lot of great people working here, so you have a lot of competition for jobs you want.  I don't think that's a con per say, but it is a challenge.
Advice: None
Pros: I am lucky enough to work with passionate, talented and fun people every day.  The work we do isn't always easy or stress-free by any means, but the people we work with, the meaningful work to be done and the way the company treats its' employees makes it worth it.

Cons: Senior leaders and department heads are selected based upon performance/technical skills as an individual contributor rather than people/leadership skills. Leads to poor people managers that drive out talented individual contributors with better technical skills who are treated poorly by their manager who still believe they know better or won’t truly delegate full authority to others.
Advice: Focus on building a project portfolio that is supply-driven by resources rather than demand-driven by multi-year forecasts.
Pros: Incredibly talented and passionate individual contributors.

Cons: Roche Carolina is in the very small town of Florence, SC.  You have to head out of town to find appropriate social atmosphere for younger generations.
Advice: There probably could be more structure for the coop program.  As always, the experience varied greatly by the direct manager under whom you worked.  My experience doesn't reflect that of some of my peers.
Pros: Very supportive of young engineers that want to learn all aspects of the business.  Provided a great co-op experience overall.

Cons: Very low earning compared to other device/capital companies, continuous changes to comp structure, leadership turnover, realignments of territories and also jobs happen yearly, dis-trust of leadership breeds very low morale among employees
Advice: get out into the filed and listen to the employees, their customers, etc. rather than hiring an outside company to reallign and resturcture. Leaders need to communicate more, establish trust, gather feedback on managers from subordinates
Pros: Best products compared to competition, patient focused, invests heavily in R&D to bring the absolute best products to market for the safest and best possible care in cancer

Cons: Roche integration has been tough and business goals implemented are almost unrealistic. This has led to retention issues within the company and a loss of a lot of great technical talent/expertise. Management needs to be more transparent.  Lack of communication between management and employees have resulted in many process issues.
Advice: Management needs to focus more on the growth of their employees. Do a better job at driving collaboration and communication to pursue a better cultural environment to work at.
Pros: Individual contributors or amazing to work alongside.  Everyone is extremely helpful if you're willing to collaborate.

Cons: Products would be better represented in the US with marketing materials specific to regions rather than a "one size fits all" global approach. Poor formulary coverage and slow to adapt to current health care reimbursement makes for customer facing financial challenges to remain brand loyal.
Advice: Re-orient senior management to current challenges that vary from region to region, and implement solutions that empower sales force to not only meet but exceed customer and corporate expectations.
Pros: Great benefits, customer focused selling is strongly encouraged and supported by management. High quality test strips with established reputation in the industry.

Cons: The leadership is excited about the idea of diversity but unable to embrace diverse perspectives, backgrounds and approaches.  It truly feels like you must fit in a box to be successful at Roche.
Advice: Please work to embrace diverse perspectives by listening to the feedback of employees and implementing a plan of action to make changes that accommodate employees feeling like they fit, are valued and are fairly compensated.
Pros: Large company, many opportunities, leadership is accessible and there can be longevity in roles at Roche.

Cons: - Arrogance at times within leadership is palpable
 - Inefficiencies in corporate governance and decision making
Advice: - Drug development is hard and risky enough as an industry.  Don't make it harder by creating organizational hurdles that limit opportunities.
Pros: - Incredible amenities including onsite (SSF) daycare, health care, gym facilities, cafeterias, unlimited coffee/espresso
 - Super smart employees
 - Focus on the patients is paramount, based on the science is fundamental, driven for the business is critical

Cons: Highly political environment where decisions are often top heavy generated. Directors/Sr Functional leaders often are just messengers and don't have much influential power. Not a very diverse company - US Employees have a disadvantage in getting  promoted.
Advice: Walk to the walk on being agile, and empower the line mgrs to make quick/fail fast decision.  Diversity &amp; Inclusion matters - and this starts with local US employees being promoted (i.e. stop just promoting the employees from Europe only to here).
Pros: Many smart people who will create technical solutions. Salary/compensation not highest, but also not much layoffs.

Cons: You felt like a pawn in a big chess game.
You could see decisions being made from very high up that made no financial / strategic sense at the local site.
No company stock purchase plan.
Advice: None
Pros: The Campus was fabulous.
Their were many resources available to get work / project  done with many areas of expertise.
Most folks were more than reasonable to work with.
Company seemed to attempt to focus on long term health of company.
Benefits were pretty good, though not as good as Syntex.

Cons: Lincoln makes their employees work hard for what you get.  The organization is a good ole boys club slow to change and far behind in terms of IT systems.  While the bonus is nice one needs to remember there are no sick or PTO time available during the year.  They feel this is part of the bonus compensation.  Also, your annual benefit deductions are taken off the top of your bonus.  Training is missing and office politics can be troublesome in some areas.  Very cut throat.
Advice: None
Pros: The annual bonus is nice.

Cons: Hard to maintain work life balance with innovative projects mainly due to more traditional IT governance and project scoping process as well as creation of milestone agreements across business units without the necessary contracts signed and in place prior to commencement. always playing catch up.
Advice: Allow at least 6 months for contracting process and plan this into realistic project plans or better yet revise the contracting processes.
Pros: Compensation & Benefits are good as well as very competitive. There are site differences that exist but these are based on local employment benchmarks.

Cons: Roche is a very large company, and it can take some time for this large ship to turn. For some roles, total compensation is below Market value while benefits are amongst the best in the industry.
Advice: Keep investing in your people and innovative healthcare solutions.
Pros: Roche attracts top talent and professionals passionate about Healthcare and doing now what patients need next. Work life balance, diversity and inclusion, and philanthropy are cornerstones of the company's culture and values. Roche offers fantastic benefits, and there are many opportunities to grow both professionally and personally.

Cons: 1. location (our office is in Pleasanton) 
2. not a lot of coffee/tea/soft drink options like most companies do and the cafeteria is pale in comparison with Genentech's (okay maybe I am asking too much ;-) )
Advice: I'd be awesome if we can have our working environment like Genentech's? (e.g., cafeteria, gym)
Pros: 1. amazing colleagues to work with
2. very rewarding projects to work on
3. team managers are very welling to listen to teams' suggestions/options and they show much appreciation to team members' work
4. great company benefits

Cons: No opportunities for advancement. No promotion track. Nothing to look forward to. Some people have worked the same jobs for 10 years. If you comment on this topic, you will be labeled as "not happy" and your managers will get notified. If you disagree with some managers because you see another way, your manager will harass you for more than a year on your performance reviews and will block you from moving up.
Advice: This management does not take advice well.
Pros: Good pay and excellent benefits

Cons: - Toxic work culture and management.  Employees are sometimes publicly berated in meetings.  Weekly meeting(s) are masqueraded as somewhere to share data and information across groups, but actually function as arenas where groups face off against each other vying for power and recognition.  Back-stabbing and back-biting of teams against each other is commonplace.  Fear, competition, and mistrust permeate the entire organization.
- Lack of concrete direction and strategy from executive and senior management leads to entire site scrambling for goals and direction every year.
- "Innovate Now" and "Speak Up" are two of the cultural beliefs, but almost no one is allowed to do anything innovative or out of the box.  Anything that bucks the status quo is immediately met with resistance.  "We already tried that and it didn't work", and then not having any data to back up claims seems to be the default response.  People catch on quickly, stop trying to contribute new ideas, turn on "coast mode", and become "yes" men or women.
- Salaries are consistently below what other companies Pharma, Biotech, or Technology companies in the Bay Area are offering even though HR claims they are performing salary comparisons.  People leaving for new opportunities regularly secure 30-40% compensation increases.  Stock options are only offered to a select group of software engineers, data scientists or directors and above, good luck everyone else!
- Contractors are treated like second-hand citizens, and I have seen many cut loose before their contracts are up.  I even witnessed one case where the contractor was given only 4 days of notice before being told they were being let go.
- Points above lead to a large number of disengaged workers that are trapped and looking for a way out.  I have observed employees actively job searching in the open office environment and even in the middle of meetings that they are supposed to be engaged in!
Advice: - Remove toxic management and employees - put them on the roof or give them severance and send them on their way.
- Increase pay and compensation to actually be competitive with other companies in the Bay Area to help retain talent.  I don't know where the HR are getting their numbers, but remuneration packages are not competitive.
Pros: -  The sequencing technology is interesting and has potential to move personalized medicine forward in the future.
-  Free snacks and breakfast fare.
-  Work/Life balance is pretty good.
-  Roche appears to be centralizing all of their South Bay and Peninsula M&amp;A targets at the Santa Clara site and turning it into an "Innovation Center".  Could be a good opportunity to be able to transfer across many teams.

Cons: I ended up in a bad team. I had wanted to connect with potential mentors. If you are a recent college graduate or below 25, the majority of employees are much older. It is difficult to speak to colleagues as everyone is in meetings and they like to speak more with their long term acquaintances than the newcomers.
Advice: None
Pros: Company has a very good reputation. A lot of hiring takes places between the pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies. If you end up in a good team you will have a positive experience.

Cons: Big company = very easy to get lost, LOTS of process; Workload is challenging to manage and full-time employees can easily work 50 hours a week; too much focus on shorter development cycles -- need to get back to focus on quality without penalizing teams monetarily for making (correct) decisions that impact timeline.
Advice: None
Pros: Opportunities for those who prove that they can do it to move around within or between business areas and divisions; Smart, passionate workforce; Solid business and good company outlook; Management continues to invest in R&D and innovation.

Cons: Lack of co-operation between groups, very noticeable politics,  micromanaging  from  senior level management, little to no promotions, poor leadership,  toxic competition between teams,
Advice: None
Pros: Some groups are really great, fun, co-operative,  and provide excellent opportunities to learn and develop  new skills. Great funding, nice lab spaces, good benefits.

Cons: Too conservative; not innovative enough. In sequencing division, organization does not have a sense of urgency, nor enough market knowledge to understand how to be competitive. Mgmt says that they empower decisions at the lowest level, but that's not the case.
Advice: Understand your market. Hire and promote more industry experts, don't just promote those who've been there ten years. Give 'agile' more than lip service.
Pros: An environment of mutual respect and open discussion. Good job security.

Cons: - Not progressive in moving employees up through the ranks.
- If you start on a lower level, it is hard to progress
Advice: It would be great if management worried more about developing employees and grooming them to move up the company ladder
Pros: - Roche treated their employees very well and had competitive pay and great benefits.
- Great vacation and holiday package
- The work/life balance was very good, management had a good understanding of the balance

Cons: Like all businesses, Roche Diagnostics is subject to economic and market fluctuations, so at times of stress reorganization and adjustment occur, and some are let go.  But, from what I hear, Roche Diagnostics offers reasonable severance packages.
Advice: None
Pros: Normally, work at Roche Diagnostics is stable, relatively secure.  The company performs well in a growing market, and management is attentive to creating a positive and productive work culture.  There is opportunity for long-term career development.

Cons: The down side to working for a pharmaceutical company is that one day the life changing drug is going to be off patent and then become a generic drug that not going to be as effective as the prescription drug.
Advice: I'm a team player and always going the extra mile for the success of the business.
Pros: A company that  thrives on the success of  their employees as well as making sure that we continue to manufacture quality product for our patients in a safe effective manner.

Cons: Constant pressure to put out more,...  Everything revolves around the punch in clock, have to be exactly clocked in when you start and exactly clocked out when your shift ends.
Advice: Make the company purpose the priority...
Pros: The pay, benefits, and the strong friendships. Training and coaching is of top quality.   Coworkers are great!! Yes your on the clock but still have a great time while your at it.

Cons: No 401(k) matching, stingy stock plan. Management asks or expects too much; overtime and/or extra shifts are assumed and extra work is given without consideration for work/life balance. Management is out of touch with front line employees.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work atmosphere. Encouraging environment, plenty of learning opportunities, participation in the process is encouraged. Medical / Dental / Vision plans are good.

Cons: Too many groups try to do the same thing without coordinating. This results in conflicting priorities and no good solutions.
Advice: They need to coordinate on strategic solutions. Put champions in place to coordinate the solutions that have backing and authority to bring all the attempts together so they at least work together instead of as separate islands that conflict.
Pros: Good Work Live balance. Immediate line management is responsive to concerns and easy to work with. They like to celebrate achievements.

Cons: The company went through some rough times laying people off so unfortunately I was not able to return for another internship.  Many people I met who worked there were laid off.
Advice: Promote from within and give more security to those who are working hard in the company.  Hire back interns who do a good job.
Pros: I worked here as an intern and they provided a very good learning experience with many opportunities to talk to leaders in the company.

Cons: A few of the employees who have been working there a long time are not very accepting of ideas proposed by people who have not been working there quite as long, which can slow down project progress.
Advice: None
Pros: There is a lot of communication between different teams in order to promote progress in projects. Most of the employees are very experienced because they have been working there for quite some time.

Cons: Sometimes a bit of micro management. Also marketing pieces needed to be redone more frequently. New buildings but several realignments (lay offs in Roche lingo).
Advice: Find other positions within the company in other areas rather than let people go from one position and then hire from the outside. Better a known, loyal team member than an unknown.
Pros: Great benefits and paid time off. Monday through Friday work week. Good training for both product line and sales presentations.

Cons: There is a line for promotions. It's rare to move ahead. Be ready to put your head down and keep moving. If you look up, you might get discouraged every time youre passed for a promotion.
Advice: "people stay when they are paid well, mentored, challenged, promoted, involved, appreciated, valued, on a mission, empowered, and trusted."
Pros: Great place to start and create a foundation of the systems engineering principles. Great culture, great people, friends are made easily.

Cons: C-level executives unable to focus on long term scientific commitments; continuous, ever increasing profit is more important.  Headquarters (Basel) will sell you out to achieve profit goal.
Advice: Selling out the Nutley facility and its personnel to placate Genentech was an affront to the dedication demonstrated by the Nutley personnel over the last decade.
Pros: When science and quality are not impeded by business processes, the daily work environment is challenging and exciting.  Operations in the US are transparent, not so in Basel.

Cons: Not many entry level opportunities available for promotion after the internship.  Most job applications require 3+ years of experience, which isn't feasible from an intern just graduating college.
Advice: Offer more entry level opportunities, especially for interns interested in staying full time who have demonstrated a strong knowledge of the field and great work ethic.
Pros: Great place to work - awesome benefits for an internship (401K, high pay). Upper leadership is highly accessible, so it's quite easy to meet leadership for mentorship opportunities

Cons: Don't hire many interns at the end of the internship. The few openings that they have normally go to people already within the company or others with prior work experience.
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible company. Honest and supportive culture. Stable industry— people will always be sick! As for the internship, you can cater it to what you're interested in and what you want to do/learn.

Cons: I get it that a company that has to deal with the government is going to be a little bit tight about new ideas, projects, and making sure they are in complete compliance. But contractors are discounted and not really involved in the discussion.
Advice: Embrace the idea that contractors have good ideas, too. In fact with their wealth of various experiences, they can probably show you quite a few new things.
Pros: Fairly mediocre, in my opinion.

Cons: Quality and Supply Issues Abound, Awesome CEO just left, Slow Moving Company, Conservatism &lt;&gt; Innovation
Advice: The #1 focus must continue to be quality.  Keep doing the right thing by your sales teams to compensate for this.  Roche is amazing and still relevant - keep innovating to keep Roche relevant.
Pros: Culture, Excellent Sales Leaders, Opportunities to Grow, Market Leader in many segments, Good Pay, Work  Life Balance

Cons: Company relied on past products and did not look to add products to the pipeline. Employee benefits reduced due to economy but still ahead of others in clubs and activites they offer and sponsor
Advice: Do not rest on your laurels; current products will run out of patent. Stay competitive with offerings and benefits of other companies.
Pros: Great benefits (health, dental, life), on site health care facility of licensed nurses and doctors, their own fire dept, great cafeterias, family time atmosphere

Cons: They didn't treat their temporary employees very well. The company they had working with temps didn't care about their employees.
Advice: Care more about all your workers including the folks that are temps because they help you daily reach your goals, they too should be rewarded like full time permanent employees
Pros: Great place to work. Bonuses were good, pto was expectional and the benefits were second to none. The pay was in line with industry standards depending on your level of experience

Cons: big, slow, and scared of change.  we are a culture of perception - no metrics or accountability.
Advice: first- continue to drive forward with current goals, I think they are right on.  but, cut the politics out of the talent cultivation process.  Hold people that fail accountable.  Measure performance, promotions should not be a popularity contest.  drop gmail.
Pros: Stable, secure, good bennies.  I think business has done very well under Jack and that we have solid leadership.

Cons: Same people will be considered for any advancement opportunities. Too much focus on Millennials while ignoring people with health experience. Too much focus on people raised and born in Indiana instead of being open to diversity.
Advice: Keep the politics aside and promote people based on their merits. Be more diverse and allow people from outside of Roche to join in order to bring fresh air to the team.
Pros: Great products, very good benefits, international networking

Cons: Management does seem out of touch at times however I've seem much worse at other companies, so really can't complain.
Advice: Strive to be a "Best place to work" to attract new scientists with innovative ideas.
Pros: Pleasant work environment.  Some perks like regular socials and variety of employee social events.

Cons: Due to lack of clear portfolio strategy, a lot of waste of resources and timeline during project cycles. Politics can really get in the way as well.
Advice: Work to understand the market better, and define a clear portfolio strategy that leverages resources in a more efficient manner.
Pros: Good people who really care about product quality and effectiveness.

Cons: - easy to get stuck in one position, puts you "in a box"
- very frequent management changes, busy to create new "strategies"
- European staff (Management) has sometimes difficulties to understand US market/regulations
Advice: Stronger focus on proper execution of strategies, rather than to create new ones.  Improve retention plans for employees.
Pros: + company is science driven
+ external, cooperative mindset
+ encourages cross-functional team work
+ decent decision making process
+ decent overall benefit package

Cons: poor management from top to mid-level. good-old boys club.  No open door policy  do not complain or you will become a target regardless of how well you do at your job. love to promote friends and family so no real management.
Advice: look at what people can do and stop just promoting your friends.  Recognize good employees especially one's that make you money and get you in places your company has failed to get in before.
Pros: great reputation in market and good products.  good benefits, ok salaries and good commissions.  fair training and good retention rate if you can stay under radar

Cons: Management not in tuned with workers and what is really going on in the company. They appear to be in their own little world and listen to each other. They need to realize that their best resource in knowing what is going on is with the people who work for them.
Advice: None
Pros: Great Benefits
Good Family and work life balance (one of the best in the companies that I have worked for)
Nice co-workers and just the people in general.

Cons: Managers at all levels act as elitists and are forthcoming about the many decisions made Without individual contributors’ input. Managers attend frequent offsite sessions. The long-standing Cultural Commitments that have served as a cornerstone are being calculatedly retired,
Advice: Leadership raises people at its best. But when not executed properly, the toll on families and psyches is profound.
Pros: Excellent medical benefits and 12% company match to 401k. Accrued vacation up to 200 hrs rolls to next year.

Cons: The headquarters in Basel were frustrating to work with. The North American headquarters in Nutley were frustrating to work with.
Advice: Palo Alto leadership was very good. The Advice to management at other sites would include better communication and more respect.
Pros: The campus was beautiful. Local Management was good. Training was encouraged. My department consisted of great co-workers who worked well in teams.

Cons: Difficult to advance along a technical career path.  Lack of vision by management.  Getting clobbered by competition.
Advice: Pick a viable path forward and stick to it.  Better planning for the periods immediately following restructuring would be VERY helpful
Pros: Good people. Collaboration within R&D is pretty good.  Technologies used are cool (but a few years out-of-date).  Pride in the applications our products enable for customers.  Flex working hours.

Cons: Products are delivered late to market, lacking essential Key features or capabilities. No internal accountability. Europe unresponsive the US market needs.
Advice: Focus on getting Europe to be answerable to the needs of the US Market. Institute penalties for missed target dates. Price to take over a market, not to be more expensive than the competition.
Pros: In-field personnel are among the brightest and enthusiastic in the industry

Cons: There are scheduling challenges when co-ordinating the San Francisco (3 hours west) and Basel (6 hours east) campuses

Pros: Friendly and welcoming culture.  Extensive investment in training of its employees.  Good processes in place to facilitate workflow.  Emphasis is on quality and not just speed.  Projects are appropriately resourced

Cons: Old Boys club.  Management needs better direction.  Plenty of low performers.
Advice: Recognize talent and realize that this location is not a big draw for scientists.  There is a trade off for this location in relation to a continuing career in science.
Pros: Location is close to the beach and there is a lot to do outdoors.  The work is interesting and satisfying.  The cost of living here is very low.

Cons: Micromanaging is rampant.   Company speaks to wanting to advance their employees but little is done to aid in that.
Advice: Invest in employees, if they have something they want to learn and do listed on their yearly performance plan then allow them to do so.  Stunting their growth will not make happy employees.
Pros: Benefits are great.  Compensation is above average for the area.  Ability to telecommute as needed for work life balance.

Cons: Mafia-styled management culture.  Even you do not know anything, as long as you board-lined belong to the gang, you are better off.   Too many "professional" managers, not hands-on,  do not know much about sequencing technology.  All they do is to fight turf all day long. Age, gender discrimination are wide-spread, and encouraged.
Advice: Shake up management team. Bring fresh blood, expert  in technology, not in politics.   Improve company culture to be more progressive.
Pros: good benefit.  Working for a good cause. Roche has some outstanding (old) products.

Cons: No strategy to the changes they are suggesting. Chaos everywhere. New restructures all over. Leadership seems to be shooting from the hip and trying to catch up but certainly not leading.

Pros: Work remotely. Lots of focus on culture.

Cons: They pay is low as compared to competition

Holidays are generous.
Opportunity to work on various projects.

Cons: 3 year cliff vestment for annual 401k lump sum. Low cap on max accrual for vacation.
Advice: Stop overloading the people. Too many analyzers for engineers to cover and too many different types to learn to become truly proficient.
Pros: Outstanding company benefits. 401k 50% up to 8% plus annual lump sum of 6% if you’re employed on December 31st.

Cons: No accountability in leaders ,  immature leadership, runs on entitlement , organizations keeps cleaning up it's own mess at business expense , no concept of customer service,  no business focus , cruise-control mode , no sense of urgency , does not have right people in the bus to take the organization to the next level of maturity
Advice: what's the use ?
Pros: Benefits  Flexibility, Global travel

Cons: - Seems that the only way to progress in the company is to jump teams. Its rare to see promotions for people who stay on the same team, only when they move to another team. 
- Pay is much less than similar positions in the area
- Disconnect between upper management and actual workers
Advice: None
Pros: - Things are pretty stable in the company (its not going anywhere)
- Benefits are expansive
- Good work/life balance

Cons: There are so many changes going on that are creating an uncertain environment at Palo Alto as well as Genetech.
Advice: Reduce the politics and focus on promoting excellence. It seems that the squeaky wheels are getting all the attention and the well oiled wheels are being sidelined.
Pros: Roche is relatively stable for the next few years (no major patent expiration looming), so there is some degree of job security.

Cons: Ivory Tower syndrome happens often where those in global corporate don't really understand what the business needs fully where business happens.  Too much bureaucracy to get good ideas off the ground and too many bad ideas being pushed down that don't make business sense to those impacted
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits.  Lots of products in the pipeline going through a lull now in the company but great future.

Cons: The Indianapolis site struggles with cultural values and is very passive aggressive.  You spend a lot of time wading through emotional decisions and emotional people. Sometimes the decisions are really off target and based upon personal perceptions.  A career can be stumped if someone doesn't like an interaction with you.
Advice: None
Pros: Fantastic company, benefits.  Global Roche is great to work with

Cons: Company/division not doing well, so its owners (Roche) may be shutting it down,
unless they find some new technology to inject.
Several rounds of layoffs, and perhaps not over yet.
New product development was abandoned,
perhaps understandably, things weren't working well.
Advice: Try harder to find places (i.e. in Roche) for people who you think did right by you, and try to do right by them, if everything gets shut down.
Pros: Good people, interesting work while it lasted.

Cons: Byzantine management structure and artificial barriers between groups preclude efficient decision making. Up to 25% lower pay for being in a division that uses acquired companies' pay structures.
Advice: Create timeline for leveling compensation or continue to hemorrhage talent.
Pros: Good coworkers and respectful managers. People are passionate and driven. The science is good and the products are good. Not high stress.

Cons: There are not many cons.  Just like any organization it can be difficult to move internally.  There is not always unity between global sites, but this is getting better.
Advice: Continue hiring strong talent and evolve the culture to a more conversational between manager and employee

Pros: Great environment, great people, good life-work balance

Cons: The company's management exhibits a distressing lack of concern for the well-being of its employees, particularly those of Indian origin. The appalling treatment meted out is indicative of a deeply troubling workplace culture.

Poland seems to top the charts as the most challenging country for fostering meaningful conversations. The overall lack of consideration and respect for people's opinions makes it a formidable contender in the race for the worst communication environment.

A disturbing trend of disregard for individuals is pervasive within the company. The absence of respect for employees not only tarnishes the workplace atmosphere but also undermines the fundamental principles of a healthy and productive work environment.

The recent focus on cost-cutting initiatives within the company has had severe consequences for its workforce. Stripping employees of their perks and slashing appraisal amounts not only jeopardizes their morale but raises questions about the company's commitment to fostering a supportive and rewarding professional journey.

The company's approach to cost-cutting reveals a concerning shift in priorities. Prioritizing infrastructure over employee well-being suggests a misplaced focus that may have long-term implications on the company's overall success and reputation.

The prevalence of broken promises within the company is disheartening. The practice of enticing new employees with false assurances rather than nurturing and promoting internal talent creates an environment of mistrust and undermines the potential for organic growth within the organization.
Advice: Promote a culture of inclusivity and respect by valuing individuals from diverse backgrounds. Encourage open communication and ensure fair treatment for all employees, fostering a positive and inclusive work environment.
Pros: A competitive salary and streamlined top management, specifically those positioned above the chapter lead.

Cons: Job stability

Pros: Work life balance was good

Cons: Long hours, management issues, environment
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits salary pay environment

Cons: So I worked in the new Services and Solutions Division. Even though promoting itself as new - it works on very outdated principles. Old fashioned, corporate legacy, too many project managers, too many unskilled people, unnecessary hierarchy, higher ups have no idea what they are doing. Innovation is not really a thing, even though that is one of the Roche main taglines. No push for the newest and latest tools. Long hours. Slow, ineffective, unnecessary solutions. Building ultra expensive offices just for the ''clout'', even though no one is gonna be there. At the same time - not providing equipment, like powerful laptops/workstations for effective work to do animation and video editing. Using G-drive - to save all of the work - like really? Overall - just slow on making any change.
Advice: You will figure it out eventually, but years will pass.
Pros: Nice people, some sort of a security, pay is ok, health insurance is good

Advice: None
Pros: Good work-life balance is a great advantage.

Advice: None
Pros: Roche is a great company to work for, it rewards it employees through so many benefits and it gives the opportunity for people to develop.

Cons: And the con is, that they will help you change of department, if you are someone expendable. If you become a key member of the team, they won't let you change departments easily, or even be promoted. Unless you mantain the same tasks as in your previous role.
Advice: To pay attention to this con that I've just written. I know many talented and dedicated people that left the company due to this, while other fellow colleagues were promoted because they were killing the SLA's of the team. 
Pros: Good salary, compared to most of the IT companies in the city.
The IT support provided is to the company itself.
Nice benefits.
Possible international relocation.
Possibility of changing department. Although it comes with a con.

Cons: Very frequently reorg and cut people
Advice: None
Pros: Good branding in healthcare industry

Cons: Senior Leadership: Like all big companies, upper management is very corporate. A lot of changes that seemingly make no sense besides boosting the stock price (and consequently, their pay checks)
- Time: it's big, there's a lot of hand-offs that happen, and things just move slowly. It took 4 times as long to get access to certain data than we expected because of all of the people/organizations that needed to be involved
Career Growth: Roche had a lot of reorgs and it's not mainly flat, so it's hard to progress in your role.
Advice: None
Pros: People/Culture: I've worked on a few different teams and I've had overwhelming positive experiences
Benefits: Decent health and dental, and I like the extra they give to put into a health/personal spending account
Compensation: It's average to above average. Nothing too crazy, but it's often above industry average.

Advice: None
Pros: - Work-life balance
- Great benefits
- Inclusive culture
- Growing business model

Cons: Sometimes it can be hard to navigate all the different areas within the company.
Advice: None
Pros: There is a lot of autonomy in picking projects and the company is super conducive to networking

Cons: 1. Leadership diversity - Obvious and known to the Informatics KL community is that there is imbalanced in the ratio of Informatics "leaders" in KL. Most of the leadership members were from the same org (before transformation). This brings about question by many people is that why is this happening? Clearly there is favoritisms. Selections were bias and will still be unless something is done to fix it. In addition, most of the "leaders" selected to be the "core" team came from the same old org. 

2. Leadership authenticity - While there are some authentic KL Informatics leaders who has gone through the transformation storm, they remain authentic and with humility. However majority are not authentic, they rather play the "politically correct" game than to be true and authentic. I think this is due to the nature of how this KL site is being groomed and driven. Now it has become a norm. Psychological safety though is being promoted in the global level, is not practice and cultivated over here.

3. Leadership inclusivity: You will see some team members are being informed for some important matters but some were deliberately left out. This could be due to point number 1 above. When there is no diversity, inclusivity gets diluted. Most recent example that the Informatics KL community clearly observed and one that is also chronic for the past 1 year, is the different ways of working between the business domain and foundational domain. While the representative for business domain product manager informed, involves everyone and promote inclusivity, the foundational domain product manager only informs and involves those in her small circle or do it by herself. It is obvious this is done to fish for credit for ownself or just afraid of others getting the credit. This reflects very bad as a whole.

4. Bureaucracy and complicated process: For some tasks and project deliveries it take ages. Sometimes you can't make decision because you need to wait for someone. And because of this the business look elsewhere and even look for other IT teams within RSS (outside Informatics) for products and services.
Advice: Relook into Informatics KL site leadership team diversity and inclusion.  I don't think the KL site leaders will be able to change this themselves, this require a full People &amp; Culture (P&amp;C) review.  Perhaps also engaged an external consultant or a Global P&amp;C.
Pros: 1. Office: Office environment is conducive, nothing to shout about as there are better ones out there.

2. Squad assignments: Ample work as the company is huge. Project delivery work is interesting as you get to deal with many areas of the organization and learn more about the business (but with caveats, see under Cons). You get to run your scrums, checkpoints and manage expectations. Once you finish your assignment you can join another squad. It also boils down if you have good people leader.

Cons: mgmt decisions often do not consider people's actual assignments which cause blocking major project deliverables
Advice: None
Pros: good org culture, diverse teams, good benefits

Cons: It is not easy to recognize
Advice: None
Pros: There is a chance to develop within a company

Cons: As someone who is customer facing and in a sales role, lack of training when first stepping in to the company is concerning and unusual in this line of work and industry. If you dont know well your own product how do you expect yourself to convince others or (customers!) to buy your product/idea?
Advice: None
Pros: An established company with established quality of solutions &amp; products that basically sells itself, buying you enough time to retain/gain customers trust especially as a newbie with lack of training wtsoever. Building good rapport and taking care of the business operations of customers would at least buy you enough time to succeed in the beginning

Cons: office is crowded when everyone is in there
Advice: None

Not much excitement at work

Pros: very decent salary compared to others in Canada
work life balance

Cons: some of the management seem uninspiring, sometimes lacking structured approach as well

Advice: None
Pros: Flexibility for working remote in another countries

Cons: None so far. All is good
Advice: None
Pros: Very approachable people 
Interesting and challenging work

Cons: Do not join Informatics. Work environment is getting toxic after the Informatics transformation in the end of 2022, and throughout 2023. You see groups of "camps" with own cronies, and then within the camps there will be sub group of cronies. Backstabbing and bad mouth is rampant behind the scene especially by this small crony, you come across some narcistic ppl who will go all extend to badmouth own team member and others so as to gain "power" and popularity. Knowing Tamil will be an advantage as you will be able to understand the bad things and lies that are been said.
Hiring and firing is based on favouritism. Most of the so-called KL leaders are fake and bias, only a few, like 4-5 out of the 20 plus are considered genuine and humble leaders.
Advice: Especially to the Informatics KL leaders, pls look into this.  You have ppl who are so-called a leader but bad mouthing others via Gchat, and during meal.
Pros: Nice facility.  Great work by the site.

Flat structure

Cons: I wish there was a proper organization structure where chapters and domain would work hand in hand!
Advice: None
Pros: Company culture is really good.. one of the best I have worked in! 
Company policies are made for employees betterment

Cons: Roche has been undergoing endless, exhausting transitions with no retention strategy. In my department, management has been ignoring the clear signs that top talent is unhappy and halfway out the door. Colleagues discuss their job hunts in the office. Workload is out of control with no new headcount in sight. Personal development and side projects have been on halt for a year while we work out our "temporary" resource issues. The only way to grow is to leave.
Advice: 
Pros: *Pays ok for Canada but everyone knows their teammates in Basel and SSF are getting paid more which is a little demoralizing. 

*Nice office but forcing employees back in by tracking them is just a bad look.

Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, decent pay, excellent benefits.

Cons: Favourism, Higher management, Hybrid model
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance
Good culture

Cons: Leadership was incompetent, with many smokers, who with their smoker fan-group made gossips about the non-smokers, who worked while the fan-group had their smoking breaks - in addition to their normal breaks, coffee breaks, wellbeing breaks etc. Some TLs ran relationships with members from their teams, allowing them whatever these wanted, i.e. daily lateness, extra days off. Then somehow only these fan-group members (usually HR and QA colleagues) were promoted, and presented as top-performers, who even in their rare and short work intervals between the breaks and their constant meetings, with usually close-to-zero technical/IT skills were still allegedly the top-performers. Meanwhile the ones beyond the fan-group (usually the ones with high-level IT/language skills) had no development opportunities, and once having realized it, one after another left the company. Hopefully things have changed in the meantime.
Advice: Hire a new HR team, so you do not let diversity prevail over competency.  Hire non-smokers for new positions, give non-smokers extra days off to compensate smoking breaks. Have less meetings - instead work. Acknowledge the silent performers. Instead of bothering and time-consuming useless psychology trainings focus on technical ones, IT, accounting, language. So then instead of being taught how to say nicely that you cannot solve the issue, you are actually taught how to solve the issue.

Cons: It become less competitive regarding salaries in the last years. In addition there is a clear strategy to move positions outside Switzerland. That’s a risk you may take into account. The continuous reorganizations in the last years has been purging the management and selecting a certain management stile profiles more focus on politics and networking that real knowledgeable people. I guess this kind of people are the ones that better survive big company transformations

Cons: On a global level, RDC have completely lost their way. Slow to market with new products, complacent about whether customers will use them. 
UK culture - has turned into a "boys club" with one team dictating direction and everyone else's views and experience discounted. Lost a lot of good, long serving people recently. I feel sorry for the good ones who are left. Customers are bewildered as to what's happened to the company and why great products have been withdrawn.
Is now so small, career opportunities are severely limited - and unless you're in the little clique, forget it.
Advice: Globally - for goodness sake launch something and make it universally compatible. Stop being so complacent. Sort mySugr out, they are draining funds and integrate them properly.
UK - Talk to the right people re NICE guidelines - stop wasting money talking to people with no influence. Listen to your staff.
Pros: Nice office, great staff restaurant and gym. Pays well, hybrid working and great benefits.

Cons: Company doesnt seem to have a clear strategy of where it is going, a lot more top down management, less empowerment, senior management seem uncertain and panicky
Advice: None
Pros: Great colleagues and generally good opportunities to develop oneself

Cons: - Not much promotion expectations if you don't speak Swiss German or have a Swiss degree. - You might find some disrespectful colleagues if you didn't study in Switzerland or you're not understanding Swiss German. Not the most though. That's not Roche exclusive. - Many repeated software tools, apps and procedures that could be unified. Some of these are obsolete. - Project managers only give priorities but rarely due dates. Afterwards they come up with urgencies, specially when they gave you 3 or 4 tasks with high priority. - Project managers don't communicate clear requirements for the tasks. Be sure you deliver a very good solution because they don't appreciate iterations and shall quickly escalate to the team manager behind your back. - Almost nobody makes minutes of meeting. Be sure you make them in order to defend yourself in front of the project manager, your team manager and his manager afterwards. Thankfully, the team manager shall most probably defend you.
Advice: SMART objectives would be a good beginning. Please make minutes of meeting. And face the problems with the colleagues directly, not their manager!!
Pros: - Workers rights and work-life balance are important in Roche. - Once you're in, they try to keep you. If your project expires, they try to relocate you somewhere else. - Very flexible with home office and working hours. I can be working at home and, when needed, drive to the site and do whatever I need to do. - They provide all the tools needed for the best work conditions. - There's a control meeting with your team manager each week. He shall help you in anything you might need.

Cons: work life balance, and workload.
Advice: None
Pros: great team and culture, industry leading practices

Cons: Compensation package is shrinking, bonus calculation is not based on your performance and company performance. The CEO changed the game by eliminating the success and contributions of all of us devoted during the COVID period.
Advice: People who have contributed during the COVID should be well-recognized as previously. Sales are those who help to find businesses for the company and group functions help maintaining the businesses. Why group functions can be rewarded more than people who risk their lives to look for opportunities during the COVID period?
Pros: Comprehensive coverage including physiological, psychological and sociological needs

Cons: Roche is very Internally focused.

Pros: Quality of the research projects

Cons: The chief accountant team is relatively new to the shared services. The workload doubled within span of last 2 year. More stuffs are being pushed to the accountants place without bothering on work life balance. Some cluster lead accountants are not even qualified accountants and the global head doesn't even bother about the work life balance/welfare of the team. more favoritism in the team, which makes the talented ones leaving and those who bravely voices out gets kicked out from the company. only puppets/followers are remaining in the team. the affiliates/local country finance tend to bully and blame the accountants, by pushing matters/task through backdoor without proper communication and approval.
Advice: while shared services wants to take over more services from local team, it doesnt mean that all the rubbish is dunoed to chief accountants. When there's issue with employee, it should be adequately discussed, else it becomes constructive dismissal. Should involve middle/independent party, else HR team tends to favor the team head and employee gets penalized. Affiliates aren't right all the time.
Pros: 1. great culture. 2. subsidised professional fees. 3. free breakfast/lunch 4. need to go office only once a week. 5. no fixed working hours 6. yoga room &amp; pool tables 7. coffee machine 8. free trainings via linkedin 9. subsidised professional training fees 10. google style office - hotdesking, collaboration area etc 11. well equipped with IT gadgets and software 12. has inhouse stage for small events 13. great healthcare/insurance package for employee and family 14. lots of employee related activities

Cons: - large, slow moving organisation
- drug development seems to be left with poor quality leadership as many good people have left a while ago.
Advice: Get rid of the non productive staff and start again in late phase drug development. It cannot be about all talk and no action. Result delivery has to be your priority.

Cons: Roche Diagnostics: Some of the managers they hire are bad people leaders and completely oblivious to the unrealistic expectations they put on their direct reports. Never been so closed to burnout in my life. Fear of speaking up led to resignations.
Advice: Roche Diagnostics: Don't promote the hardest most dedicated worker ito become head of commercial operations if the person lacks people leadership skills and basic empathy and understanding that each individual is unique and should be valued even if they are different from the manager.
Pros: Roche Diagnostics: Good values at the core, patient focused and some people leaders were great!

Cons: -N/A in my opinion, not meaning that there are no challenges to handle and accommodate to, but it's all about adapting to changes, having an open mindset, and being able to raise a hand when something is wrong, I feel that management is always willing to hear, adjust, help, inform.
Advice: None
Pros: -Work environment/culture is amazing (you get to work with a lot of teams all around the globe, and you can see that there is a homogeneous mix of ethnicities, cultures, etc)

- Excellent benefits

Cons: Limited possibilities to switch role / job if you are working in clinical trials dept.
Advice: None
Pros: One of the best pharma companies

Cons: - The company mandates 2 days on average in the office. Effectively a burden for anyone who does not live in the Hertfordshire area or Northwest London. 

- The company uses badge swipe data to measure how often a person has been in the office. If this is below average, then disciplinary action may follow. This feels outdated and creates a culture lacking trust, and an uninclusive environment. 

- There's zero allowance to work from abroad. This is unfortunate if you are not from the UK and have family and relatives abroad.

- Permanent work from home is not an option unless in extreme circumstances.

- The overall 25 days of annual leave is a statutory minimum and other companies I have been working for had usually higher amounts. This is especially low considering how inflexible is the remote working policy.

- The HR or People and Culture are nonexistent on the site and barely visible. They do not gather employee feedback and do not work efficiently to update policies in time. 

- The upper management and head of the site are detached from the real work the employees are doing and do not trust that they can perform effectively even outside the office.

- The company and head of site rely on blanket policies (e.g. 2-day mandate, etc.) instead of trusting line managers to find effective solutions with employees that fit the business needs and align with company values. 

- The career progression seems slower than in other industries and somewhat difficult to predict.
Advice: Trust your employees that they wish to do the best work possible and stop exercising control over people. 

Stop comparing pre- and post-COVID data and start thinking about how a modern organisation operates. Plenty of workplaces operate effectively without resorting to uninclusive policies such as mandated days and tracking of employees based on badge swipes.

Invite employees to provide feedback and work efficiently with the feedback to improve the culture and trust at the company.
Pros: + The work itself is interesting, there's a variety of projects with meaningful impact. There are also many opportunities and options to move within the company.

+ The gig-based system allows people to try new things across Roche and supports people who don't hesitate to join a new role.

+ The colleagues are amazing and the offices are pleasant with an onsite gym and canteen. 

+ There are also a lot of employee-organised clubs and activities if you have time for them. 

+ The company is transitioning towards more modern ways of working with data.

+ Teams operate in agile methodology which particularly in data science works well.

+ Various open-source, cross-industry collaborations have meaningful impact.

+ The sick leave policy is flexible, as well as the policy to occasionally change working patterns or hours.

Cons: Too many project what the operative level can't handle.
Advice: Recruit more people on the financial area
Pros: Compensation is quite good comparing some other SSC.

Cons: Leads / Managers tech stack is old school
While working on latest tech stack, sometimes it is difficult to convey the exact technical hurdles due to such limitations of leads.
But, they still do consider.

Fewer people than needed (could be project specific)

Promotions are hard to come. Increments are low once joined.

Increments and bonus are based on company and product performance.
Advice: Could be more engaging on how to carve out a career path for individuals. What are the steps people need to take to grow in Roche.

Also, if there are good yearly increments, I can say most of people will not even look outside for jobs.

Apart from this, you guys are doing a great job!

Keep it up!!
Pros: Good work life balance
Good pay
Good facilities

Cons: Slow pace so may take time to get things going
Advice: None
Pros: Extremely friendly environment where everyone aims to help you grow

Cons: Environement is toxic, there is a lot of nepotisim going on, there is a division between people who came without connection and with connection (they are treated differently by managers too), speakup culture is a lie (you should never speak up, if you do not have a connection, because you will be viewed as trouble-maker), investigations are formal and aimed at making you look like an idiot. Middle managers just want to cover everything up to keep their positions. There is a sense of fear that senior managers will find out. Everyone just wants to keep their positions even if hurts the company.
Advice: Be more involved and don't blindly trust middle managers. The company punishes people who are passionate about their job, who have integrity and courage to speak up.
Pros: Salary, fully paid sick leave, number of vacation days

Cons: They pay much less, then other companies in the for same positions.
Advice: None
Pros: 5/4 home office is available
Predictable, when you need to make overtime and they always communicate about it transparent and in time.

Cons: Middle management quality is deteriorating rapidly as the focus is shifting on cost cutting. Little interest in internal career development, don't expect a promotion unless you are ready to leave and apply elsewhere. Recognition is pretty shallow.
Advice: Too many incompetent people have been left after rounds of layoffs aiming at cutting costs. Almost no manager is assuming responsibility for actually taking decisions
Pros: Great company to work for, decent salary and working conditions. Facilities are top notch and the working type is relatively flexible with Hybrid and work from home.

Cons: The company went through a big transformation in the past years and people are still a bit confused with their new roles.
As any “old school” company, there are many employees that have been there for &gt;15years and it can be hard to navigate as a newbie, because internal knowledge is more valuable than external (in the company’s mindset).
Advice: Need to improve diversity - lack of minorities in senior leadership roles.
Pros: Entrepreneurial mindset: you own your time and execute your job the way you prefer to. 
Good work life balance.

Cons: Constant process transfers and tool/platform changes. Platforms are not operating well and not supported well technically. Projects are led by unexperienced/low skilled PMs. Job scope and volume is highly different in the AP teams for the same salary. Lots of new tasks and reorganizations are happening without any compenzation. Most of the people are tired and fed up with the never stopping changes and extra tasks.

There is no real career advancement salary increase is low when you change jobs.
Advice: Define clear scope and adjust salary to it. Let people rest and work as normal not in constant project mode. Hire PMs thar are able to take responsibility and lead a project through.

Advice: Reduce your thick senior management layers and empower the front end workforce, focus on retraining on new technologies or business opportunities. Build a company that leads the world again.
Pros: As long as you are in this company, you learn a lot and get many opportunities to explore and experience different fields in healthcare.

Cons: overall it was a good experience

Cons: location and lack of career progression
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits and team dynamics

Cons: Don’t value much the experience and is difficult to grow
Advice: None
Pros: Great opportunity to learn and develop new skills

Cons: Roche has been a very successful company for many years, reaping the benefits of a strong Swiss work ethic. However, this constant success has led to a low sense of business acumen throughout the organization and a very powerful HR (P&amp;C) department. Combined with a desire to follow every new trend from San Francisco and chase high ESG ratings, this has unfortunately led to an environment that is heavily influenced by woke and gender ideology. Performance, impact, and accountability are no longer values that are being recognized.
Advice: Recognize and promote Performance/Business impact and be more pragmatic in regards of purely social political agenda. C-suite appears disconnected from the business and do appear arrogant in how they address concerns from employees
Pros: Campus infrastructure and canteens are great. Basic Benefits (saleries, bonus etc.) are decent

Cons: Office in PJ hence commuting is a challenge. As MNC, meeting sometimes outside of office hour.
Advice: None
Pros: 1) Flexible working hour.
2) Only need to be at the office once a week.
3) Can apply to remote working if you need to go out of town.
4) Free breakfast or lunch which can order through 3rd party app.
5) Working style following international standard (MNC)

Cons: in constant reorganisation, no time to work in between. Fear culture. Speak up culture has become a joke. Poor senior management.
Advice: Marketing is important at all level in a company but when 95% is just marketing and 5% real work, you wonder how the company can make money. No surprise: real transformational work takes time and no one is given 2 years to take such risk between 2 reorganisations. My advice: reorganisations should happen only 5-6 years. Hire managers based on concrete proven delivery experiences not on how well they sell themselves. 
Pros: big companies perks and advantages

Cons: It’s a very big organisation…. And transforming always (at times to the detriment of productivity), global teams split across a 9 hr time difference makes collaboration challenging and slow at times
Advice: None
Pros: Meaningful work at an innovative company, great colleagues and culture, decent career progression and good benefits (mat leave, compassionate leave)

Cons: No flexibility. They claim job sharing, time working flexibility but it’s not the reality. The hiring manager is the one that decide and in pRED there is not such a possibility
Advice: Give what you promote!
Pros: Very cool and futuristic buildings

Cons: One of the IT areas have continuous re-organizations since years. I like the company, but they do not give us a rest just to peacefully could focus on our work and our work/life balance. The management with these changes - reducing headcount and costs - giving us the stress factor. And we also can not travel anymore freely on business/workshops to meet our Colleagues face to face. Earlier there were more career opportunities, I also do not see such strategical or motivating positions anymore. They keep the salaries on much lower market level than few years ago.

Great team &amp; environment to work

Cons: Woke / ESG-hooked, so performance, experience and education aren't primary promotion criteria anymore. Recent (pandemic) restructurings into "teal"-like organisation (chapters, networks, squad) is a catastrophe: almost zero career progression opportunity combined with a zero accountability culture (self-organised teams, you know, so Chapter Leads not tied into the success of their "members") // Basel fading in relevance relative to US and this is reflected in leadership appointments and work culture.
Advice: Stop the woke stuff (if you can re: ESG requirements) Reverse the "Teal" nonsense it isn't working and hasn't ever worked Fire senior/executive leadership en masse (accountability for teal and chaotic re-re-restructurings) Make the use of plain English a point of business

Cons: Slow, disorganised, some dead-end work
Advice: Business partnering is not new. Clearer accountability. More efficient processes
Pros: Fascinating company, European travel, interesting work and a positive message to promote

Cons: The backfilling of people is really slow, and this combined with the high inflation in the country equals us working more for less. On the long term this might motivate people to leave and the current status could become more unbalanced. There are a lot of unnecessary information going around the company- there should be some measures taken to prevent information overload for all the employees. When human beings are translated to numbers, every single aspect of our work should be taken into consideration. Or just don’t try to interpret people into units. This cannot be done anyway as everybody works in a different pace and the management will never truly know the actual efforth until they have tried to do the job (long term). There is no opportunity to go up the ladder nor to step up to higher positions thanks to the ‘innovative’ organization strategy. People are stuck in the same position.
Advice: More appreciation with mentioning the EXACT achievements. By saying ‘thank you for your work’ would not motivate anyone and makes the impression of not paying attention to the incredible amount of work put into different projects or just simple routine work everyday. Actual inflation following raise would be great. Or some kind of ad-hoc compensation to raise up the morale a bit (and keep people). Not enough trainings/ learning opportunities are provided or they are not organized/ advertised well that could be used at possible future positions or other workplaces. There should be more available positions in the same areas. The grading system should be revisited as the descrptions belonging to the grades do not cover what people are actually doing. It should be great if there would be a consultation involving all the departments ( each employee!) what is not apt and how should it be amended. I have to mention the Workday platform: it is horrible and should be changed as soon as possible.
Pros: Flexible home office-office time, very good office, good equipment, IT guys are very able and helpful, great team and generaly good choice in management.

Advice: Management may consider diversifying growth opportunities for employees, especially those in support roles. Explore ways to expand their responsibilities or offer career development programs that align with their interests and skills
Pros: A strong culture of open communication and transparency is actively encouraged. Employees are given the freedom to leverage their talents and skills without unnecessary micromanagement. The renumeration is also great.

Cons: Long work hours, some employees are doing all the heavy lifting while others coast. Some senior management have so many direct reports they are unable to really have a grasp on what their employees do/don't do. Workloads are more often than not, uneven. More reorganizations than I have ever seen in any other organization, many times very senior or tenured employees let go.
Advice: Connect with your direct reports frequently to ensure they are able to manage workloads and reassess when not.
Pros: An amazing employer overall everything from from compensation to the beautiful Mississauga office is designed with employees in mind. Lots of job opportunities and especially if you're willing to move internationally. I can see why some employees spend a majority of their careers with the organization.

Cons: Transformation fatigue, more difficult to for talent to keep developing, some poor leadership from managers (not the CEOx)
Advice: Avoid having the flavor-of-the-month type of managers with a hierarchical attitude. Results and outcomes are a must, precise. However, some managers believe their deep, detailed review and obsession with asking for more is effective. We are losing what made Roche great a decade ago and are not taking care of great people anymore with limited development opportunities.

Cons: Slow growth, lot of micro management, less recognition for the work
Advice: None
Pros: Work culture is very goos

Cons: Our ambitions are really high. Accordingly, Roche expects a lot from its employees and managers. In addition to the provision of services, the Roche culture also attaches great importance to the mindset and how we treat each other. This at any time and in any situation also during transformation.
Advice: Global approaches are very helpful in many aspects, but not always the best solution! Sometimes local processes and/or regulations would support patient needs even better. Our efficiency in working together would be greatly improved by a standardized nominclature of the organizational architecture in our network. Please clarify this.
Pros: Roche has a strong pharma AND diagnostics division. This combination enables us to optimally support the challenges related to health. Roche is broadly positioned, invests heavily in R&amp;D - also for niche products and has a convincing portfolio in the pipeline. It makes me really proud to be able to make my contribution to "Doing now what patients need next" in this company! Roche attaches great importance to attractive working conditions and jobs.

Advice: None
Pros: Benefits, Comp, Location, Office, Salary

Cons: Processes galore, usual big company challenges
Advice: None
Pros: Excellent people, opportunities for growth and career

Cons: People and culture practices are disorganized and behind times. While D&amp;I are huge topics and publically supported and endorsed through talks, HR practices and benefits do not fully align. Maternity and healthcare benefits for a company that seeks to drive healthcare transformation and betterment are worse than companies that don’t even have a mission in healthcare. Global senior leadership in the sales and marketing (commercial) organisation is messy, poor, and honestly severely lacking. Lots of talk, meetings and design sprints but no real action on their side to implement change. Colleagues and peers carry the weight of the work and receive only verbal support than mean very little in practice.
Advice: Completely restructure and reorganise the global senior leaders in the commercial organisation Overhaul Hr benefit practices, we can’t afford to provide median or average benefits for our employees health, when our mission is to elevate the healthcare across the world. Practice what you preach And do more to support D&amp;I goals through policies and HR practices. Events and talks are great but it needs to permeate the entire system.
Pros: In general, loads of wonderful colleagues who care for patients Peers walk the talk and finely believe in the mission Purpose-filled work

Cons: Base pay is lower than it should be The communication in-house is terrible No visible action is taken when there is a problem The pipeline from intern to employee needs improvement Management lacks motivation, experience, understanding
Advice: It's worth considering that when multiple team members leave within a short period of time, it may not be solely due to the individuals themselves. It could be worth taking a closer look at the team's management and identifying any issues that may be causing employee dissatisfaction.
Pros: Home-office is great Work-life balance is nice The benefits are not that bad Colleagues are supportive and friendly

Cons: you cannot work from abroad and if you change position you salary increase is minimum

Cons: Structure change. Follow global structure.
Advice: None
Pros: Career growth
Flexible
Good benefit and perks

Cons: Technical teams are under the leadership of non-technical managers. If you possess strong technical skills, you might find frustration in dealing with managers proposing strange and baseless ideas. Despite the company's global presence, the teams remain isolated and resistant to embracing diversity. The majority of projects are outsourced to external firms. Given that it's a pharmaceutical company rather than an IT one, exercise caution before proceeding unless there are no other alternatives.
Advice: Revamp the outdated IT leadership. They seem disconnected from the value they bring to the company and often generate unnecessary requirements to impress upper management. Prioritize projects that contribute to the company's revenue generation.
Pros: Fair pay scale Training budget

Cons: Very stressful work, high level
Advice: None
Pros: Very great place to work

Pros: Good work environment, nice and intelligent colleagues to work with, opportunities to work in other countries, truly global environment, good work-life balance

Cons: Workload, limited flexibility and career progression.
Advice: Improve the salary structure and perks.
Pros: Great culture, people and environment.

Cons: Despite how it may seem outside, there has been too many transformation within. This affects morale in general. As for the particular team I was in, most colleagues are truly godsend but the management of the team is weird - don't be fooled by the flashy job description, you will end up doing 10 different roles in one. Everyone is expected to "volunteer" and take on unrealistic workload. Lots of peer pressure to conform and go with the Roche way. Expect long hours if you join this team. Expect to be like instant coffee, 3 in 1 role. It has been a disheartening journey that didn't get better. Forget about career progression. It is so called "flat hierarchy" and you'll be in the same role for decades. A quick research of the team and you will notice the attrition isn't great - for all the reasons above,
Advice: None

Cons: Workload/work life balance. career prospects
Advice: None
Pros: Salary, rewarding work environment. Great international support system

Cons: The company went through an HR transformation in 2021 which resulted in having a really small local HR team and an SSC in Budapest. Even more than a year after the transformation, there is no clarity regarding what tasks belong to whom and the lower you are in the hierarchy the more tasks you will get from your local colleagues in higher positions and there is no option to say no. My manager was in Budapest while I was working in Woerden. My manager and my Budapest teammates had no clear idea about my tasks and had a terrible relationship with the local team. I belonged to both teams and when I was with the Dutch, I heard complaints about Hungarians all the time which was verging on racial discrimination. The team located in Budapest holds grudges about the Dutch team which results in a toxic environment in which the person in the role of People Support Specialist is in-between. The lack of knowledge and understanding of Dutch labour law and Dutch language in the Shared Service Center results in lots of mistakes when it comes to the work of those supporting the Netherlands remotely.

Cons: Risk adverse Can be difficult to navigate when new. Complex informal and sometimes political networks which take time to understand Due to size and complexity, can be slow to act. Internal stakeholder management can be frustrating Still struggling to give early in career talent a stronger voice. Experience is often over valued more than potential Pays at the midpoint but it's pharma so that is still a great salary
Advice: Strive for more simplicity. Pay more attention to the voice of early in career talent to understand what future employees are looking for
Pros: Large healthy organisation which has a great internal job market with global opportunities Respectful culture, working on and improving diversity &amp; inclusion Interesting colleagues from all over the globe Highly networked and evolving towards a more agile way of working Passionate about patients Head Office in Basel is great for work life balance because of the size of the city Pharma with a purpose

Advice: None
Pros: Innovative and engaging culture in Roche

Cons: too hierarchical
intern salary too low
Advice: None
Pros: good employee benefits and team environment

Cons: Mountain loads of red tapes and layers and layers of internal processes and ad hoc tasks from customers that take most of our time from ACTUALLY learning product knowledge and doing ACTUAL sales. Benefits could be better as an MNC. And from a sales point of view incentive structure is so underwhelming for a MNC. And no claims for toll &amp; parking when going out on field when that is the industry standard comparing with other pharma/ med device MNCs. They claimed to have it covered in our monthly allowance (which is also lower than industry standard) - claims for toll &amp; parking should be a given, given how we HAVE to travel to do our job &amp; get sales
Advice: Cutting off benefits slowly is discouraging and incentive structure should be improved to match industry standards so as to keep talent at the company.
Pros: No micromanagement and flexible working culture as long as work is done. Good and collaborative working culture. From a newbie like mine’s POV everyone is helpful and willing to land a helping hand

Benefits: Roche typically offers competitive compensation packages and benefits, including healthcare and retirement plans.

Cons: Healthcare industry work can be more stressful than other industries
Advice: None
Pros: Brilliant place to work, the Burgess Hill office has a great group of people

Cons: Management changes too often and with them, drug development focus
Advice: To listen more careful to the teams that provide feedback for management decisions. To have a long term vision and build on what has been done, avoid 100% changes with every new middle upper management change

Cons: - Constantly restructuring, confusing for employees to fully comprehend. - Information all over the place, unstructured. - Many acronyms to familiarize. - Common practice to be multitasking / handling multiple projects across multiple timezones at any given time.
Advice: - Implement better structure and find better ways to make it easier for everyone to find information in a more consolidated manner. - Lots of opportunity for cost optimization. Many duplicated efforts and unjustified expenditure. - Really exemplify and embrace 'One Roche' across the organization. There are still segregation between Dia / Pharma / RSS mentality evident among employees: in terms of budget allocation, benefits, exposure and equal credit.

Pros: Great environment and good working culture

Cons: - there is a new operating model, which has many benefits, but unfortunately also has a few cons, primarily that there is more work for the same amount of people and that the change has inspired some experienced employees to leave. - despite the flexible working, there is a mandate for how often you are in the office, which many people do not want and is affecting retention. - change happens, but is slow
Advice: - focus on the welfare elements of the staff
Pros: - flexible working, do not have to be onsite all days - good facilities on site - expected benefits package, some good ones like dental and loss of income due to illness protection, opportunity to buy non voting shares - a more accepting culture of diversity than I have experienced elsewhere - large, relatively diverse pipeline

Cons: Limited career advancement, the rest are acceptable
Advice: None

Cons: Significant investment in R&amp;D that is not paying off and cuts are happening to other parts of the org to make up for it
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, good leadership, strong benefits, nice campuses

Cons: some areas are severely under-resourced. It can be hard to get support sometimes as a lot of functions are outsourced and not local anymore.
Advice: Actively participate in the development and implementation of continuous improvement initiatives. provide guidance and advisory to first level support teams.
Pros: Roche 's company culture is characterized by open-mindedness, motivation and trust.

Cons: No plan. No structure. No concept of getting anything done at maximum levels of wastes. A culture and management that prevent tough conversations, with middle management filtering anything that is not praise. Everybody being "nice" is part of the problem. This is known on CXO level and can be seen in public analyst reviews and market capitalization. Yet, what is done about it is too little and too amateurish on all levels of the enterprise. "Transformations" that don't lead anywhere as they mostly focus on reshuffling hierarchies to reduce headcount, while conceptually little is achieved to change what is done and how. The lack of quality data paired with maximum complacency, never looking outside how good looks like, makes everything opinion-based and consequently political theater. A false narrative of being a learning organization means that nobody in the higher ranks takes accountability, as everything is part of organizational learning. However, this is done on the back of thousands of employees, creating change fatigue that drive good people out of the company. Therefore, success is entirely based on leadership's opinion about an individual or group, never based on tangible impact. This leads among others to an incredible amount of PowerPoints that look beautiful, praising false successes, while there is little to nothing under the surface. Since nobody knows who does what and how to work together, the amount of meetings and workshops without agenda, concept, meaningful outputs is impressive. Advancing in the company means playing the theater for enough to get promoted based on tenure. This can be seen by looking at the trajectory of employees on LinkedIn.
Advice: Take a hard look at your enterprise strategy and the people that are tasked to execute it. Out with the old, in with the new. Start measuring, implement Lean and quality control beyond the amazing products that the company offers. Act with speed and accountanilty, nobody is waiting in 2023 for Roche to figure out how to be an efficient and effective company.
Pros: Minimum controls on what the employee does, where he works, what he achieves. Ability to apply for any project anywhere in the company. Everybody is extremely nice on interpersonal levels.

Cons: Transformation &amp; Lean organization (job can be obsolete faster) Most jobs are specialists; you don't get to learn as wide range (it can limit your own career growth if you don't do anything about it) Sometimes you do not know where to get resources / help / information to do your work

Cons: I'm enjoying everything here, no cons
Advice: None
Pros: It's a pleasure to work here

Cons: - You won't get the pace of a start up. - Several too-ambitious R&amp;D projects fail, which leaves especially engineers gutted. - The Rotkreuz location is a long commute from any major city. - Frequent re-organizations carry inefficiencies and attrition. Those occur every couple of years on a smaller or larger scale. - High mobility does not necessarily imply fast career progression. Progression highly depends on current situation and luck. Also, women have a faster track, making some opportunities harder for men.
Advice: None
Pros: Best company I ever worked for. - Strong culture of empowerment. - Extremely high average quality of people: constructive, competent, ambitious. - Ambitious projects that push teams out of their comfort zones. - Quality is appreciated; if you try to propose an improvement in quality or efficiency, it's screened objectively, as opposed to most companies affected by change-resistance. - Treats people well.

Cons: It's a Hungarian company under Swiss label. It's not multinational environment so don't come if you're used to diversity. Manager's aren't willing to change anything and all managers are Hungarian. Old employees are always handled as old good friends so it's difficult for new joiners.

Pros: There are no pros at all.

Cons: Constant reorganizations make it hard for employees to really settle in ways of working.
Advice: None
Pros: Work-life balance, good benefits, nice atmosphere

Cons: With high turn over, resignations and the 10 year continuous global restructuring, you should think twice before joining this company. 
Roche is largely and disproportionately driven by sales, rather than patient outcomes, with marketing department considering all other functions as a support to increase sales but not as strategic partners. 
All this contribute to a bad culture environment and lack of innovation which became obvious during COVID pandemic.
Even during these challenging times, Roche did not offer real support or working flexibility to employees (they may tell you they do but check the details). 
With many people leaving and constant leadership changes they increased pressure and workload on the one staying. 
They may feel they’ve checked the box for diversity with recent LGBT and disability networks but again it’s more for advertising purposes than real inclusion. 
There is no diversity in way of thinking, you won’t feel safe to speak up unless you agree with the majority. 
Finally, HR are known to trick candidats with fake benefits and verbal promesses.
Advice: None
Pros: Learnings and promotions but for very few people
Probably many opened positions given the high turn over and number of resignations
They can offer very good wages but then you will have to sign a confidential agreement as they want to be known as not paying so well and keep most people as low as they can.

Cons: -Roche is not challenging themselves in terms of innovation. I have heard times again people thinking that there is no other company better, but that is simply not the case. Coming from a different environment, I can say for a fact that some other companies could teach Roche a thing or two if they were humbler. The start up day was also an excellent example of Roche being extremely arrogant and patronizing towards people who could have taught them. 
Innovation teams are very senior and poorly diverse and you can feel it in the quality of proposals. Attitude towards risk taking is very adverse.
- The commitment to Diversity and Inclusion in general in Europe is not sufficient, I have been in situations in which team leads had some very racist and sexists attitudes and comments towards women and people of color. I found that HR and leadership did respond to these comments but very slowly and the atmosphere festered for a long while making it painful for others. The diversity on the board and other major leadership teams is also appalling. 
- The management of the pandemic was poor and management refused to acknowledge it. In public office hours people were told again and again to get on with it and that it was going to get better. Sometimes it's better to recognize that you simply do not know what will happen instead of pretending that you can predict the future of a worldwide pandemic.
Advice: Open yourselves to advice from people who want to make the company better. Don't be defensive about what you do not yet do well. It won't help, and it just drives people away who could otherwise have help. If you take a serious commitment towards D&amp;I and especially LGBTQ+ equality make sure that this is felt in the whole company and not just  in specific pockets of the company. Give people time and money for the work they do on these topics instead of asking them to volunteer.
Pros: The company has been there forever, and it is very stable.
They are very committed towards sustainability, and they walk the talk.

Cons: Compensation is a bit lower than market

Advice: Spending all the time and effort to transform and be more agile means nothing if your managers don't lead the way. Everyday I turn on my PC and the Roche wallpaper says "be a better version of ourselves" or "be customer centric". What happened to the pillars? Where's the spare parts to fix broken machines.
What about staff? No parts is one thing, but no engineers to fix instruments is another.

Roche Diagnostics Australia should be better than this.
Pros: The prestige of working for Roche in Australia.

Cons: I didn't find any issues
Advice: None
Pros: Great company culture and opportunity

Cons: Hiding behind a process slows down things very much. The agile way of working, while good in some parts of the company, is either not widely adopted or is understood and "practiced" in a very different way than originally designed.
The organization culture deteriorated as well after the HR transformed itself towards "ticket-based" ways of working, resulting in focusing neither on People nor Culture development.
Advice: Retention and new ways of attracting talents should be the top priority right now. It seems, though, by the long transformation the IT is under, Roche may start "bleeding people" soon, especially the offered compensation is more and more disconnected from the market

Cons: I always loved working for Roche, recently there is lots of restructuring ongoing which for me does not always makes sense, you can tell that Roche ties to save money wherever they can.

Advice: Only advice to management is to train the leadership team to stop being biased.
Pros: Compensation is good. Company has great vision

Cons: Heavy workload, but still manageable. The company has been transitioning to Agile ways of working so me, being a newbie, has a steep learning curve to overcome. They fully expect you to be self-sustaining and self-managed, and it can be difficult without proper guidance especially in the beginning.
Advice: None
Pros: location-agnostic roles - check! You can go as far as you can with Roche, as they expect you to be the visionary and architect of your career development.

You work in different roles at the same time but you only receive one salary
In my case, I had a boss who was bullying, disrespectful and did not put the responsibility on the fair people, but on the most overloaded because they were the most efficient.
Many people believe that because they are older they have a higher priority than others and do not respect the company's project prioritization processes.
There are very problematic people who are promoted to boss and are forgiven for their faults (workplace harassment, lack of respect)

Good year bonus

Pros: Really great Place to Work

Cons: The company has always been far too internally focused.  It is a deep seated element of the Roche culture that has not been effectively countered and so now it is just being ignored, and consequences are coming to the surface.  Long term internal focus is costly in the long term.   

The company has changed over recent years as margins have dwindled and the diagnostics branch prepares to greet commoditisation of its once dominant product offering. 
Experience as a quality is stepping aside for generic thinking and business-by-textbook. 
The Dx branch did not take enough of advantage of its leading position while its competitors suffered major setbacks.
Now the competition has caught up, it is becoming difficult to differentiate, meaning an increasing reliance on customer loyalty, which benefits from long term relationships with trusted company specialists, whose experience is now undervalued.  Available resources are reallocated to patch ailing hardware that should have been obsolesced many years ago.  

Take your experience somewhere where they know it is valuable and and never let them tell you that you can't do what you believe.

senior management
Flexible working

Cons: The pros depend on who you work for. There are many people at Roche in the UK that are deadwood, sitting in senior positions without adding anything to the business. If you work for one of these people then you are generally fine if you can create benefit to them (ie make them look good; allow them to take all the glory) up to a point. However, if you have ambition and want to progress you will find there is little opportunity because of this deadwood. Even if you excel you will rarely find an opportunity because people like to keep you below your capabilities (this has a corresponding effect on pay, whereby Roche is in the bottom quartile of salaries). This has lead to a culture of bullying in the UK, literally dozens and dozens of people have been forced out as they are cheaper to get out the door then the 'lifers' that are bullying. The problem tends to be made worse by a HR department that panda's to the people creating the problem, because they lack the skills and experience to do otherwise.
Advice: Shake the tree. The potential is there for Roche UK to be one of the best parts of the company, but the bullying and problems caused by the minority of senior management has allowed a great number of talented individuals to leave. You are a small cog in the global wheel, so be careful.

Advice: None
Pros: Working at Roche Basel makes me feel valued and appreciated. The company treats its employees with respect, and offers great benefits.

Cons: If you want to stay in Brazil, and are not willing to work abroad, you may not achieve a General Management or Finance Manager position, which are traditionally more intended for expatriate managers or Brazilians who have worked abroad and/or have established good connections to headquarters. But that is true for many other multinational companies as well. 

There have been several major changes in management, organization and even culture in the last years, which would leave every company in a state of transition and anxiety about what comes next. 

The company gives interesting challenges to talented employees but often with little formal classroom training. Be prepared to be thrown into cold water and learn to swim for yourself.
Advice: 
Pros: Roche is a company that is really willing to invest in people who are willing to make an international career. Fact is that in order to make a major career at Roche, you should be prepared to work abroad for several years. 

Roche Diagnostics Brasil Ltda in Brasil is a separate legal entity from Roche Pharma Brasil, with its own management, IT systems and company policies. As it is much smaller in size to its Pharma sister, yet has a similar management overhead, there are probably better career opportunities here. 

The company has a relatively young management team and has again and is not afraid to promote young people if they deliver results and are politically astute.

Career

Cons: People spend a lot of time talking in circles in meetings, get to the end, panic and try to fit in 1 hour of "meaningful" discussion and assigning actions into 5 minutes, and repeat every fortnight. Nobody actually does anything but are always busy! 

Productivity is much lower than it should be; very little self-motivation and use of initiative (gets overlooked by managers who are concerned with their own career progression more than anything else).

The only pharma I know without a guaranteed flexible working policy. You're expected to be in the office in this dull town unless you have a specific reason agreed with your line manager beforehand - no working from home.

Lots of bureaucracy hindering change and complex processes required to navigate simple tasks but that is the same in every large company.

Very little opportunity for progression; excellent opportunities for personal development but it will mean nothing unless you are one of the chosen few (largely under-qualified folk who "look" the part). 

You will be constantly overlooked if you want to move up within the company.
My advice is to get the Roche name on your CV and leave for greener pastures.
Advice: Practice what you preach when pledging diverse backgrounds and expertise for roles. You don't always have to look outside.
Get rid of the people who aren't contributing any value. You know who they are and you let them get away with it.

Pros: Very well organised company to work for.

Cons: too many changes, less fixed job titles
Advice: None
Pros: career development, less fixed job titles

Cons: The recent transformation has brought a lot of hot air - big words, like agility, you make the difference, empowerment, etc are used completely out of balance. This is the biggest shame - now I see top paid leaders on stage that dont share any vision but mention that teams need to come up with vision and strategy etc .... so, why do we need them ? exactly, to produce a lot of smoke and big words....honestly, I dont know which box I ticked wrong in the yearly engagement survey (GEOS) that has made this rapid turn around. Yes, Roche used to have many processes, it was burocratic, etc but now I find it even worse.
In terms of career - if you dont come from US / genentech, hardly any chance to grasp a senior role in GPS in the future - there is a strong network that is fostered!
Advice: Please, take a detailed look at the operational level, and replace some senior functions immediately to manage a healthy turn around. And dont let your vision be blurred by diplomatic communication "This is the best place  to be ... I am so proud...etc" - why dont you do a quick ad hoc GEOS or similar survey ? Maybe I am wrong - but what I hear around the corridors I did not hear few years back
Pros: Great pipeline, great people and talents. Used to like the culture a lot. Strong commitment in changing patients disease journey, outcomes, quality of life

Cons: Support functions can be slow and bureaucratic at times

Advice: None
Pros: People-centric organization
Family values
Focused on bringing value to patients

Cons: - The decentralized decision making also birthed a plethora of systems that do not connect to each other, causing many process inefficiencies, confusion and complexity. It also slows down implementation of company-wide initiatives as it requires all or many stakeholders to agree and accept it first. I guess there are pros and cons to centralize vs decentralized anyway, so I can live with that.
- Regional or country leadership positions require international experience due to the global-connectivity of the company. Therefore, people with mobility restrictions are stagnated.
Advice: None
Pros: - The company truly walks the talk in all decision-making to put patients first ALWAYS, it is NOT just some PR stunt. We feel truly connected to that noble purpose, and it trickles down to our daily work as well. It really helps us refocus on patients to get us through even mundane or bad days. With the strong emphasis on patients, it almost feels like I am working for a social enterprise.
- The company is also very kind, compassionate, people-oriented and caring. That care is especially apparent during this Covid-19 pandemic. Simply unparalleled care and concern, that I feel so touched.
- Decision making is decentralized, hence there is a lot empowerment and room for small countries or small teams to innovate their own ideas in their own territories.
- It is also a truly global company without borders where anyone anywhere can participate and contribute to any project regardless of location.

Cons: work stress and less recognition
Advice: None

Cons: - Some of the coding technologies are old
Advice: None
Pros: - High Quality Development
- Good expectations with the Ramp Up
- Perfect treatment

Cons: Barely anybody speaks English. Most of the employees, including payroll, do not speak English, even though I was told otherwise on the job interview, to the point where I was told multiple times to 'ask a colleague to translate' some official communication. Lots of career development is based on who was your university colleague or who your partner is.  Management lies, often publicly pretends they didn't hear about an issue while in reality it was raised with them a couple of weeks previously. They behave patronisingly, lie about the salaries (which are very poor comparing to other corporations in the city). Staff changes all the time and is not respected. I spent min. 10h at the office every day - out of which 9h was regular, as it included an obligatory 1h break. Horrible life-work balance.
Advice: Stop treating people like children and servants. Start caring for them and treating them like employees of Roche instead of making them feel like they're worth nothing.
Pros: Good benefits for Hungarian reality. Most of the TLs are horrible with people - just a few of them are good enough to list them in the 'pros' section, however they are pushed down by the higher management. Maybe the experience is different if you're a native Hungarian speaker.

Advice: None
Pros: wonderful company to work for

Cons: - Tasks can be a bit dull at times
Advice: None
Pros: - Amazing colleagues
- High salary
- Flexible working

Cons: It's impossible to do anything fast!  If you want to implement something you have to jump through a lot of hoops to get it done.  This is especially the case with IT....the documentation in IT is a killer and when you're not an IT person it can be very frustrating.
Advice: I think in order for our organisation to be more agile we need to take a leaner approach to projects and the documentation required in order to ensure a speedy implementation.  The other thing I would say is that Roche spends a lot of money each year on contractors.  These contractors have been with Roche for a long time and I think it would be more economical for the company and a much better experience for those employees if they were made permanent.
Pros: I work within a great team and i am fortunate to have a very supportive Manager who encourages me, pushes me outside my comfort level and who wants to develop me and see me succeed.  I have been fortunate that in over 10 years with the company I have always had great managers and for that reason I have developed into various roles in my time here (in various countries).  I love my job and love the people I work with.

Cons: Everybody is stretched too thin.
Advice: None
Pros: The brand name does most of the heavy lifting in sales

Cons: Salary is a little lower than for similar sized pharma companies and WGC is an expensive town with not much to do in/nearby unless you want to go in London which is not what I want to do if I just fancy a quick drink after work with my colleagues. 

In terms of work, it's hard to find information sometimes as it is almost hoarded in teams. If you ask for the info you'll get it but it's hard to know what's available as it's not readily shared when it should be.  Information and updates sometimes take a while to filter down through management and occasionally it feels a little a little disjointed.
Advice: None
Pros: I love working here! I genuinely believe in the company tagline "Doing now what patients need next" and feel that most of the workforce also believe in this and feel that they are contributing to helping patients (regardless of job role). The benefit package is pretty generous although the wages are a little low compare to similar sized pharma companies. There are flexible work hours and the ability to work from home several days a week if you like. The work life balance is good and the people I work with are really knowledgeable  and approachable.

Cons: Hard to innovate or push for new ideas
Advice: None

Cons: must work hard but that's a given
Advice: None
Pros: Great salaries, good spirit and culture, putting patients first

Cons: However, after reaching some mid-management level, there is a clear gender disparity
Advice: None
Pros: Roche is a people-oriented company who invests in development

Cons: - Too much ongoing transformation and changes
Advice: None
Pros: - Good culture
- Great benefits

Cons: over worked and not paid enough for fuel
Advice: None
Pros: good pay rate and nice community

Cons: - is currently in a Transformation process towards agility but especially senior management mindset has not shifted (pseudo empowerment that leads to a situation where nobody knows who makes decisions) 
- Global HQ has a strong culture with strong talent while Roche Germany (Grenzach) is more an old school command &amp; control culture
- While diversity is high on the agenda (which is good), it seems to be solely focused on gender rather than different cultural backrounds (e.g. Emerging markets) and very much shaped around a single minded US/Genentech culture that does not feel very diverse
Advice: - Either delegate or have clear governance &amp; decision making. Some governance has been take out to drive decision making but the old command &amp; control mindset has maintained. That creates a dysfunctional organisation that does not allow people to drive decision making and move things forward
- Take diversity serious and go beyond focusing it on gender only. The typical Senior Management backround is US/Genentech (hardly anyone from Emerging Markets and other industries) and that does not create truly diverse thinking
Pros: - Good compensation
- Strong culture with a good balance between performance and people focus
- Strong talent 
- Strong pipeline

Cons: Slow process, boring consensus culture
Advice: Wake up
Pros: High salary and good conditions

Cons: Diabetes care is a disaster zone at present, wholesale redundancies (50+ out of 140 staff) jobs awarded without due process to whomevers face fits, very poor staff moral due to uncertanty of role and financial situation, appaling behaviour by  some senior management who are  rude, conceited and incapable of perfoming role, ( or just unable to perform their role). senior management who boast about their salaries and the value of their expense account whilst people are being made redundant. very slow to market, new services and offerings 2-3 years late, massive market errosion,  not a place to work at present, steer clear as you wont/cant make a difference
Advice: weed out the senior mangement who are conceited, arrogant and incapable. ensure that global products are fit for purpose and ready for the uk market, not 2 years late. products are no longer market leading, just also rans in a crowded market place which offer neither value nor technical advancement
Pros: excellent supportive staff, nice offices, resonable pay and benefits,

Cons: I think all of us facing issues or difficulties regardless of our workplace, the situation is never ideal. Still I think I get all the support I need to solve these things.
Advice: None
Pros: I think Roche Budapest is a special place: 
I have never experienced this kind of people focus before, I always feel treated really well, during my more than 4 years here. I always feel safe and in this current pandemic situation it is proved even more.
The mindset and the behavior of my Colleagues is extraordinary: the kindness, empathy and openness with they turn to others is really inspiring. 
This is something we implement into our everyday as people leaders too.
My own development has been supported from the very first moment, beside the continuous discussions with my line manager, the soft and hardskill trainings provided by the company, I had the chance to join of several projects and initiatives, both within RSS and global ones. As a Team leader, I also strive to create opportunities for my team members to reach the best version of theirselves.
I am really proud to be part of this company and to be able to contribute to Roche's success.

Cons: Croniism: employees either do what they're told or lose their jobs if they're ever considered "challenging" management competency/decision making.  There is systematic witholding critical information for scientist to do research (insecurity from the top down).  There is systematic covering up of mistakes from the bottom up, especially lower lever managements (dishonesty).  There is absolutely no respect and no support for the foot soldier employees, thus talents are wasted.  Meanwhile there are so many lazy employees taking advantage of the cronies in the incompetence management and just benefit in the "Roche welfare" system (one director to another: you hire my wife, I hire your wife).
Advice: It is too late for Roche.  Even if they disguise themselves as Genentech.  All employees at Roche, current or past, knows exactly what it is and who they are and they all deserve to go down with the company, does not matter whether they contribute to the demise or they were not allowed to contribute to the company anyhow.  Genentech will eventually have to adapt to the Roche system.  Then the collapse will be complete.
Pros: HLR has the infra-structure to do good research and innovating product development.  There is resources available to do good science.  There is access to advanced scientific knowledge to do good basic and applied research.

Cons: Bad leadership, toxic place and depends on like and dislike
Advice: None
Pros: Good overall salaries and benefits

Cons: - Because of the regulatory and quality standards and processes that need to be followed, it often feels like things take much longer to develop, improve/innovate, and approve
- Process-driven; still feels like the company is not too tech-savvy, apart from maybe a few divisions in the US
- Hierarchical; obviously this depends on your area of work/team but generally a lot of more senior employees have been around for 20-30 years and are not keen to change how things are done
Advice: None
Pros: - The culture at work is fantastic compared to any other company I've worked for; teams are generally very collaborative and international teamwork is encouraged 
- The company encourages international and secondment experiences and makes it quite easy for people to move around different offices in the world and/or teams - even across Pharma and Diagnostics
- If you have a scientific background, you can find your niche and an area that you're truly passionate about and use your expertise in a real-life way
- The brand is very well respected and recognised
- The quality standards are extremely high

Cons: The hours required are huge, almost everyone in my team works most weekends and evenings in order to complete their workload, and this is what is expected by senior management of their employees. 
The focus is not on patients as the company would like people to believe, the primary focus is making as big a profit as possible, and decisions which may help patients are not made if their is no money to be made from them.
Locally, the company is under resourced, despite winning a large amount of new business 
The salary is considerably less than what I would be on now, if I had remained working in laboratories in the public sector.
Advice: Hire more staff locally.
Pay staff in accordance with what they would get if they were in the public sector.
Have a true focus of patients and healthcare, even it means not making money from the odd contract.
Pros: The work is varied and very interesting.
The people in the company are very friendly and easy to get on with.
The majority of the team are excellent at what they do and committed to doing their best to help their customers.

Cons: Basic work etiquette is not taught, some bad apples bring bad attitude to work. Middle managers are useless and invent their own jobs. Do not contribute to revenue generating activities. Management receives no professional training and thus has no clue about priorities, conflict resolution techniques or even basic staff resourcing. The ineptitude of management affects projects and instead of learning from their mistakes they entrench and barricade themselves inside their own ignorance. Pay is lower than industry average in CH. Partner companies like Hays are simply robbing Roche employees to the tune of 40% of their salaries and Roche is fine with that. Instead of compensating properly people who create Roche products company prefers to reward useless middle men for doing payroll paperwork. Hays is probably owned by someone related to the board member.
Advice: Let go of people who do not contribute directly to Roche revenues. If you cannot explain what you are doing at Roche , you don't belong at Roche. Stop destroying shareholder value with 100s of  do-nothing office drones.
Pros: Open collaborative culture, friendly and inclusive staff with a few bad apples.

Cons: The best opportunities are not in the UK and therefore I cannot apply again as I am now in The North of the U.K.
Advice: I managed a global IT portfolio from Basel. Saw my line manager twice per month. I did this role autonomously and was in contact with other portfolio manahera throughout the globe evening calls etc. 
I had to return to UK and after getting some great results Inhonearly don't see why I could not continue to do this role remotely? All to do with Visas and insurances apparently?  There are many roles I feel Incould manage remotely for Roche and would love to work for them again but cannot relocate due to family reasons now.
Pros: Global opportunities to work with and learn from really intelligent people. Training and advancing your career were a priority to Roche, you mattered.
I was Educated in multi cultural working, Travelled the world and was given opportunities to work with many high level colleagues who all took time to mentor me.
Work life balance was always promoted.
Fantastic organisation, good salaries and bonuses and pension scheme was amazing .

Cons: The learning and development where I was based is dismal. From day one there was no training and basically it was you are on your own you work it out. Being told by your manager that you have had many sick days this year with only having 3 days off got me gob smacked especially when you do out of work hours and don't get paid any extra nor time in lieu. That was the final straw the sick days comment.  Expected to be a graphic designer all though this was never in your job description, you ask for training in design packages but no that would cost money so you have no choice but to go home and you tube tutorials and they expect you to be an expert! Design packages aren't like learning a program like ms word there are alit of elements you need to learn.No career advancement opportunities being there for 9 years. I am so glad to have handed in my resignation and see the back of that place. I had one year before I hit my 10 years long service but for the sake of my sanity it wasn't worth sticking it out!
Advice: Listen to the little people
Pros: People, parking, free bananas, that's it!

Cons: Nothing that really stands out. Everyone generally thinks processses imposed are overkill, but I got numb to this after a while and am just zen now whenever I'm faced with process slowness to deal with. On occasions though it does mean I kill a potentially good idea to the business (not present it) because the hoops to jump through just put me off and I'm usually at full capacity or more usually. Noke of these are real problems to me, but they are to a business.
Advice: Restructure all departments a bit more often please, keeps the business more agile, gets rid of deadwood etc. Find the people hiding in the system - they can be loud or quiet personalities, you just cant tell who is not pulling their weight and who is abusing the trust employees are empowered with. I hope you can distinguish between those who talk the talk and those who can actually walk the walk.
Pros: Good, yet cheap food in cantine. Stimulating work although I think the life cycle of a role im in feels pretty short. I feel unstretched now.

Cons: - Decisions are mainly taken in Europe and USA and took some time to be applied in all affiliates, in a very competitive market, this can be a bad thing
- Lots of top-down decisions without empowering some job level that can help to improve processes
Advice: Innovation is in the DNA of the company, but many current processes need to be innovated as well. To do this, a culture of innovation needs to be applied in our areas of the company, not only in the research centers. Without being innovative, and take a look in all process and areas, as a consequence this will not allow to promote and launch new innovation to the market in a very near future, taking into account that our competitors are not the one we used to know, but new ones that we don't even know, maybe they don't exist yet, but for sure, they will take advantage of exponential technologies
Pros: - Great environment to work
- Lots of opportunities to work around the globe
- Heavy globalization culture that allows you to improve communication and language skills

Cons: It's a huge global organisation so some of the internal processes are clunky. A recent internal interview process has taken more than 3 months. Decision making in general is slow and opaque.
Advice: There's a layer or two of management just below the top where many pay lip service to some of the values. 360 performance reviews don't work so well in a culture where there is a high value on being nice and polite and managers who focus on managing up tend to thrive at the expense of those who do a god job in leading their teams.
Pros: Great people with a sense of purpose. I've worked here for more than 20 years in different functions and countries and never once been asked to do something I thought was wrong or unfair. Ownership structure gives senior management freedom to focus on a longer strategic horizon so the direction does not change as abruptly each quarter as I've experienced and still see in other companies.

Cons: It´s officially a Swiss company but it´s actually run out of California. It´s hard to get promoted beyond Director unless you base yourself there or are happy to spend 12 weeks a year on a plan to San Francisco.
It´s also a terribly opaque organisation, which makes it difficult to know where you are in your career or plot a way upward. 
This is going to get worse with the pursuit of agile ideology that is being sold like a pox vaccine to large enterprises by management consultants and leads to organizational restructurings according to agile principles and use of agile newspeak in work areas for which agile isn´t designed (and harmful, i.e. everything outside software management).
Advice: Stop it with the social engineering attempts and woke ideologies. Keep that junk in California.  Most employees (at least outside California) come to work to earn a living, not be lectured on ethics or showered with Ersatz-religious platitudes that entitle "crybullying" and search for offense to be taken to further personal agendas.
Pros: The only option in Basel

Cons: Time spent on organizational politics far exceeds that of getting the job done. Pharma and diagnostics completely independent divisions. Scientific and financial background with a very conservative marketing culture. Freedom to experiment but no desire to change, largely fueled by portfolio success. Mix of traditionally decentralized organization and recentralization of a number of function, creating some confusion, compounded by a clash of culture with Genentech's.
Advice: Do not think innovation is limited to scientific research, do not be content to address tomorrow's marketing challenges with yesterday's proven techniques. The slash and burn approach resulting from new senior management team and Genentech acquisition is letting go of a lot of knowledge and experience which is fast becoming counter-productive.
Pros: It is quite easy to go over organizational boundaries and hierarchical lines, as well as taking initiatives beyond one's formal job description. New CEO very charismatic, but his inspiring, it would be great if this new style could trickle down through the company.

Cons: The company views promotions as a privilege vs.  paying employees for the greater responsibility & more work that will be performed.   The company cannot survive without their Specialists (product-specific experts) to help the Account Executives accomplish their jobs, as selling, contracting, negotiations, etc. are very complicated.  And yet, Specialists make nominally more than Account Executives, even though they work harder & have much more responsibility.  No wonder they have a hard time keeping Specialists & filling the vacant Specialist positions.
Advice: Adjust the compensation structure to accurately reflect the responsibility of the employee.  Also, quit thinking like a startup company, when in reality you dominate the market.  Mara Aspinall was definitely the right choice to lead the organization, as she is shaking up the "good 'ol boy" network, but she still has some work to do to.
Pros: You will learn a great deal about capital medical sales.  The company is in a transition as it becomes more integrated into the Roche culture.

Cons: Lots of great line managers (esp first time line managers). But be VERY wary of middle management. Too many have their own agenda, are out for themselves, give only lip service to company values etc. Will not back you up; in fact, would not hesitate to throw you under the bus if it helps advance their career. Senior management either doesn't know or doesn't care about the middle management problems
Says it has a speak up culture but the reality is a long way from the ideal
Matrix organization = office politics galore
HR is not on your side
Many depts seem to be reorging with possible loss of positions
Advice: Fix the middle management problem!
Pros: Meaningful work: people really are committed to improving the lives of patients with serious health problems -- that's a huge plus
Strong science and research focus
Strong commitment to sustainability
Good salaries and benefits
Global opportunities and many opportunities for short-term assignments in other locations/departments (with manager approval)

Cons: Social Management committees explicitly and vehemently excluded LGBT elements even as simple as rainbow flags from the corporate sponsored Diversity Day (a day which in all corporations is designed to recognize and celebrate all minorities).
While Insulting LGBT personnel is considered rude as a rule, mockery of heterosexual personnel as being gay is acceptable, vocal, and not uncommon, even in the presence of LGBT personnel. 
It is not uncommon for personnel to express personal disgust at the idea of homosexuality & transgendered individuals are mocked in a manner utterly devoid of sympathy or compassion.
Advice: Please educate the Mississauga culture to live in time with the greater Roche culture. As it stands, wfh is my strategy to dealing with these problems.
Pros: The office space is generous. Telepresence technology is top of the line. There is plenty of room for growth and an esprit in the company which promises growth.

Cons: to many changes
normally weak middle management
Advice: None
Pros: Good people working
Good challenges 
Different possibilities

Cons: Career opportunities, office based preference
Advice: None
Pros: Patient focused, great culture, innovation

Cons: - low budget salary
- ancient technologies
Advice: None
Pros: - great culture
- kindness
- employee centered benefits

Cons: Some organizations need really care about company values,
Advice: None
Pros: Work balance, Career opportunities, Learning paths

Cons: I don't find the culture to be particular high performing. In many cases I find many employees who have been in the company for long periods and seem to survive without having the necessary skills or willingness to acknowledge change is needed in the company and within themselves. Also there seems to be too many people in some functions, many of whom resist change to justify their existence. Also I find the salaries to not be terrible competitive. Also, as a multinational HQ, I would expect more prominence of English, however, there is still a german first culture for many communications, signage, and forms, this detracts international assignments. 

The largest con I see is the highly decentralized structure, while some people think this is good, so far I have seen no real benefit particularly in support functions. The inefficiency and duplication, particularly in things like real estate management, finance is astounding.
Advice: Question what really needs to be decentralized, vs. what should be managed as a group. Start with real estate and facility management.
Pros: Pleasant, mostly friendly work environment. Most of my colleagues are friendly and want to do what is best. Workspace is generally nice and high quality. Budget for travel and training seems to be available if a business case is made.

Cons: Particularly in the global functions, the work-life balance is bad since the integration with Genentech as we now have many evening TCs, which means that weekday evenings are usually spent on the phone talking to people in San Francisco.  Whilst I like my colleagues in San Francisco, I would rather spend the evenings with my family....
Career opportunities for Europeans, in my area, are non-existent.
Advice: Scrap personal bonuses.  The amount of management time & destructive internal competition that they cause are just not worth it.  I have seen weeks wasted making up statistics to justify individual's bonuses and projects kept going long after they should have been killed, because they are in people's targets.
Although we are still have family ownership of the company, we have recruited many managers recently from the outside, that still have short-term based thinking, this is eroding the more visionary aspects of the Roche culture & replacing it with much "busy work".
Pros: The salaries & benefits are good. Office accommodation is generally good and the tools that we have to do our work well. Espoused corporate values are good.

Cons: Unfortunately right now there are more cons than pros at this company. However, I outline the top 3 cons below-

1. Poor senior management - they give direct reports no visibility into short term or long terms objectives and there are no employee insights incorporated into plans. Its basically here is the plan, just implement and do not ask any questions.  

2. Culture of fear leads employees to not  speak up. Those who do get a 'mark against them'. 

3. Constant change and poor communication has resulted in employees feeling paralyzed and unable to perform their roles.
Advice: * You hire knowledgeable and innovative people. Listen to them and engage them with the company direction. 
* Focus on senior management actually 'talking the talk'. Roche Global has great programs/culture for employees, but in practice this is not being followed. 
* Listen to the employees on the ground. You have truly amazing people who work for you.
* While flexibility and change are good in the pharmaceutical industry, employees need to see a plan and understand why flexing is needed and what they are being asked to do. Without this, it looks like an inability to devise strategy and implement.
Pros: * Colleagues (below senior management) are supportive and caring
* Excellent pipeline and drug development

Cons: Unfortunately within Roche Diagnostics Australia there is a now culture of bullying and some would say this is from the top down. Certain individuals at lower management are repeat offenders especially in NSW.  HR and middle management just brush it under the carpet rather than root out the problem leading to a view by many that this is endemic.
Advice: The last GEOs reflects many colleagues feelings, there has been a decline over the last few years.  Someone from Basel or Singapore should come down and start asking questions and not to be taken in with the excuses and coverups.
Pros: Interesting and rewarding work, Roche is actually a good company to work for worldwide as the rewards and benefits are fantastic. I been working at Roche over 15 years and although sometimes face the usual issues and internal processes most of the staff are professional and great to work with.  Fantastic new office in North Ryde right beside the train station so now very easy to get to,  undercover parking if you choose to take car to work.

Cons: Commercial head is biserk and biased with no knowledge on sales and marketing. 
Management is biased and immature set of people who has no knowledge on business
Advice: None
Pros: Research products in oncology. Excellent product pipeline

Cons: The Shared Service Center is still very young - only 3 years old - so the process are still yet to improve, and this is what we are working on altogether. "Rome wasn't built in a day." :)  It also then makes us an agile company! :)
Advice: Keep the good work and to many more years at Roche !
Pros: Waking up everyday knowing that I am eventually saving lives of others, or making it easiest to live, is a blessing. 
My colleagues and managers are hard working , experienced, benevolent and very smart. They help me grow and improve. They also are very understanding and flexible. The most important is to reach our goals. The Team Building activities are legendary. I simply feel part of the Roche family! 
The future of Roche GIS KL and the Shared Service Center is extremely promising. 
The premises are very beautiful, healthy breakfast and unlimited fruits &amp; coffee/tea/chocolate everyday, plenty of other activities thanks to the Dream Team!  A lots of efforts are made to take care of us and I feel very lucky and grateful about it.

Cons: Far too encumbered by self-induced delays and hindrances. Too much excuse-making of the FDA inhibiting advancement, when the main causes are internal. Very political culture - it's often who you know. The pro's of freedom to do your job is countered by having many 'fiefdoms' where local 'tyrants' rule by holding a critical position.
Advice: You have done a good job in providing the vision and organizational structure needed to advance.  There are some areas, esp. in R&D, that have been allowed to build mini empires, to the detriment of company performance and cohesion. The R&D management staff has not been changed at all in the past five years, though everything around them has changed - does that make sense? Beware of those just saying what you want to hear!
Pros: Benefits package is one of the best I've experienced. Freedom to do your job, Fair amount of freedom to do the job (though, see caveat below).Spread out campus allows you to get up and stretch when needed.

Cons: - Highly hierarchical and bureaucratic at times - which creates a very political environment. 
- No work-life balance. Leaders do not care enough about employee well--being. 
- Leaders don't always walk the talk - i think mainly because they don't know how as opposed to being hypocritical
- Bonus system could be better. Performance Management & Compensation system not conducive to innovation or getting the best out of employees - Too short term driven and individual vs. team driven.
Advice: Be honest and transparent. Stop packaging the truth - just speak it. 
Build up leadership skills focusing on interpersonal skills such as conflict management, communication skills, empathy and listening skills. 
Take risks on your employees! and have the courage to let those go who underperform!
Pros: - Good compensation in general
- Generally friendly work environment. 
- Majority leadership is genuine and means to do well. Just don't always know how... 
- Multinaltional, international company with great career prospects
- Majority of people I work with are great.

Cons: In my 10 years plus I have seen reorganizations to cut peoples jobs, no empathy for any worker and  if you are over 50 your are out, "Business decision". Nobody retires in the company and few make it to over 50 ... Roche has good value like VW, but they bury them at their convenience. Your ideas are welcomed but keep them to yourself. Only upper management has ideas.
Advice: Roche now has the management philosophy second-rate people hire third-rate people. Upper managers clone themselves when hiring, so everybody is aligned. This also goes for Rank-and-file employees.  If you stick out you will get hit first. Roche's  Philosophy on a global scale.
Pros: In the first year you are there is excellent you are given time to adapt. Very competitive on your salary normal 10% to 20% lower then the market. They (top management) say if you have the desire to help people take the cut. Although it isn't a charity as the profits show. Development is left to you and if your department has budget to develop you but most likely there is no budget .. we are told to say.

Cons: Recently willing to let a lot of experience and talent walk out of the door, in one several restructures in the past few years. In many cases, it seemed those who didn't shout the loudest and self-promote well enough lost out. 

Transformation has in some areas created a leadership vacuum, and 'bold' decisions have sometimes bordered on 'reckless'. In the short-term this could mean some turbulence.

Chances to progress are limited unless you want to 'go global'
Advice: Live the values you preach. Give meaningful feedback. Understand what you are transforming. Embrace accountability. Be prepared to lead by example and make transformation much more than just the latest buzz-word. Do not keep asking for the same old things we are being told to leave behind.
Pros: Some really good people, and some really good things about the culture. Trying to transform and become a modern 'teal' company.

Theoretically, everyone is empowered to 'lead from every seat'

Cons: Mediocrity accepted
Focus on just trying hard as opposed to delivering results
Conservative values
Lack of courage and creativity.  Market follower, not leaders
Good ole boy network (white males) rules
Poor career management support and succession management, even for those considered "high potential"
Americans are not given career opportunities.  Must be from Germany or Germanic country (Switzerland, Austria, etc.)
Advice: Finally, Roche is getting more focused on the needs of US market.  Time will tell to see if it is a passing fad or just trend du jour.  Need to appreciate and welcome outside ideas and embrace innovation.  Treat people as valuable assets that are full of potential to contribute and have real responsibility.  Implement true career management and succession management so high potential talent knows what roles they can prepare themselves for and aspire to.
Pros: Good benefits
Indy is a good place with lots to do and affordable cost of living
No patent expirations that lead to significant revenue loss (unlike pharma companies)
Friendly people

Cons: Career planning is up to how well you are at managing yourself in a decentralised matrix organisation. Can be a great opportunity, but don't wait for someone to offer you something just because you've been around for some time. Implementation is bottom-up, allowing a lot of room for new ideas, but making strategic decision-making long and cumbersome.
Advice: Should be more visible in the organisation. Roche is very decentralised, which is good. But low visibility can look like lack of strategy.
Pros: Smart and collaborative colleagues across different functions, pretty much everyone I've met wants to do "the right thing", when it comes to serving patients, good work-life balance and fair compensation. The company is very international, but still has a bit of a "family feel" to it. Managers are actually concerned with respecting people's time off. The company has a great legacy and remains at the forefront of medical research, great basic commitment to innovation and people.

Cons: Culture- the company have recognised this is an issue and have a strategic focus to help people flourish. 

Processes are not consistent, especially around recruitment and promotions. Salaries and mid points are not openly discussed, awards for reward schemes eg Roche one club , Long term incentives etc are not transparent.

 Functional experts and people managers seem to be less rewarded  than those that lead high visible projects.

There is definitely an underlying issue with  culture that is hard to pinpoint but can be destructive to confidence. 

Those that do well generally need to be  globally mobile which means the UK affiliate has many over qualified talented people that are not utilised to their full potential.
Advice: The only real way to change the culture is to change the leadership team completely
Pros: Brilliant pipeline with over 10 launches in last few years and several more planned. 
Amazing investment in R&D
Fabulous facilities in the UK
Professional atmosphere
Supports well being
Clear company vision around patients

Cons: The lower posts in the company are constantly kept in the dark and expected to just do as they are told to. The company ALWAYS comes first, the benefits are seeked to be the lowest possible, both in terms of saving on later tax paying, and the local payments avg. taken into consideration.

When it comes to SOPs, everything is defined by them, but the leadership doesn't seem in a must position to follow them as the lower levels in the hieararchy are. In smaller countries, the career opportunities are really a fairytale and only the quietest employes are kept on board.
Advice: Start trying to keep prospective and visionary oriented employees on all levels, and do it promptly. That's the only thing that can save you from biosimilars.
Pros: Cutting edge products, a great place to start your career in and understand the whole process of innovating the pharma bussiness market nowadays. Office culture is outstanding.

Cons: Total lack of objective evaluation. Never explained to employees why some things are happening. A colleague with extremely low performance, who was 50% of the time absent in two years, got promoted and nobody ever understood why. Salaries are totally not performance based. One must just fool them at the interview and will enjoy a higher salary for ever without doing anything. Tarif scheme is totally communistic and performance-killing. Germans are always promoted much easier no matter their performance. Management is extremely poor. Motivation is killed. You are just a headcount number. Complaining pays off to make you shut up. Mannheim location is UGLY.
Advice: Get fired!
Pros: Secure environment, almost impossible to get fired, relatively good salary. Training opportunities at the beginning. Mobile phone for free (it's not a pro, but could not think of anything else to fill in the 20 words).

Cons: Senior leaders are nearly invisible across the organization, very little transparency and lots of lip service to things like culture, diversity and leadership commitments without action or accountability. Often significant, unnecessary inflection points and wild swings of direction on teams as leaders come and go. HR is only there to support you until there is an issue and then they will always support the +1's and toss you aside.
Advice: Take a hard look at people, practices and GEOS results, the environment globally is not getting better with the same issues persisting year after year. Get rid of those leaders that are so insecure they feel threatened by their colleagues or direct reports.
Pros: Individual teams are often great made up of highly engaged colleagues that work hard and support each other to succeed. Benefits are better than the industry average and keep improving each year. Bonus payouts have been well above industry averages for several years.

Cons: POLITICS! 
Leaders feel so entitled! They abuse their power and authority. If they dont like you even if you are a perfomer, they will replace you. They will hire employees they know from their previous companies or from their organizations. The HR &amp; management tolerate such. You cant even feel the presence of HR in the organization! No genuine concern to employees. They dont really care. Leaders (dia) do not really walk the talk. They often violate policies and guidelines.
Advice: Develop internal talents who has heart for the company &amp; for the patients!
Pros: Good company in general (values, mission, vision), good benefits, free lunch, try to promote work-life balance (all depends on the boss)

Cons: 100% corporate world
mid management living in a bubble
A lot of experiences people are leaving the company - it is a pity that there is not idea how to grow them inside the company - the idea is more to make them leave
a lot depends on the manager - there are procedures but the manager may try to tell you that your case is special and does not apply,
Unsupportive HR dept 
Politics at all levels 
Work life balance sucks when you work with people across 9 hour time zone difference (both ways)
pay lower than the average on the market
Advice: Make sure you take accountability seriously and not only on slides
Pros: Great work atmosphere,
working with great and skilled people,
some new technologies, 
good benefits (medical, sport clubs and retirement plan)

Cons: While the organization benefits from a highly educated workforce, internal local politics rule way too often. Local politics can help to a certain extent, but in some cases this is taken to extreme and moreover it happens in the detriment of the organization. Personal interests overrule the well-being of the organization. Some projects are given to people on the basis of personal relationships. Sometimes it feels middle management is playing a human size game of chess.
Advice: None
Pros: This organization is meant to survive and thrive the Industry 4.0. The values it stands for can definitely speak to the new generation of professionals entering workplace. Multi-site, multi- generational, multi-cultural, real efforts to maintain and boost gender diversity, etc.
Networking place a crucial role in how career development happens, which can easily have a downside.

Cons: Its sad to see such great Company have weak and extremely bad management.  Weak HR and despite all could be avenue for staff to voice up does not work. Global just simply leave it to region to resolve. Region will just cover up. Staff who are make redundant realised after departure  most of job junction got passed around the office. When current staff protest the job scope was considered for outsourcing. Its seems no evaluation was done and its not due to losses. Some staff gets away with rude behaviours and creates very toxic environment.
Advice: Global to note and understand if staff highlight issues - do your own investigation. If its left to Region, alot of issues may be glossed over.
Read the reviews not only from me but others on promotion etc. How staff felt promotion is not based on hard work but how it benefits certain people.
Pros: Good medical benefits and  good branding

Cons: The outcome of your employment is only based on the team/department you join. There are extreme political games within the company. Even they happen mostly on higher level, your job can be easily affected by this (e.g.HR as a support function is involved very much). If you join a stable team, have a good manager, you are lucky and can even plan a great career. Of course you need to be well-connected as well, but that goes for all multinational companies. Self-branding is a must to succeed.
Advice: Avoid Involving non managers into politics. If they are affected, you should at least protect them.
Pros: Stable company, average salary, great opportunities to continue career abroad.

Cons: - Bureaucracy, has a lot of unnecessary procedures and red tapes.
- Inexperienced local senior management in handling IT projects(commit on projects with unreasonable timeline, ridiculosly low budget, and expect to build castle in the air).
- Talented peoples are leaving really fast.
- Local senior management has no respect for lower ranked staffs and contractors.
- Dictatorship style by local senior management. Staffs that challenge their decision were told to leave.
- Blames are pushed from everwhere and nothing gets solved. In the end all goes to lower ranked internal staffs and contractors.
Advice: Get rid of the bad leaders if you are really serious about expansion.
Pros: - Great office facilities, free breakfast.
- Talented and experienced coworkers.
- Challenging projects, great learning opportunities.
- Get to learn and observe the art of how the local managements push away responsibilities and still telling everyone they did a great job.

Cons: The culture of the company is archaic and horrible. Management is far from good and decisions and promotions are based highly on politics instead of actual prowess. Shutting up and not trying to change the status quo is encouraged, trying to do something new is punished. There's a high level of useless people that work less than typical government clerks but with high salary, exploiting the flexibility and benefits of the company to ridiculous levels. What could be a great place to work turns into a boredom and psychological pressure nightmare thanks to the people ruling this place
Advice: None
Pros: Facilities are great, they provide everything you need. Flexible schedule and paid extra hours. Extra benefits apart from normal salary offer a good package overall.

Cons: 1. Do not respect diversity
2.silo thinking
3. Everyone thinks they are an expert in everything!
4. Not entreupanarial
5. Behaviours and culture are just words- you dont see them in practice 
6. Zero integrity-,will leave you out to hang
Advice: Stop living in your own world and look at reality.....will quickly become as hated as the banks if you dont take a closer look in the mirror at your behaviuors. Stop judging people on a single meeting, give an opportunity for them to prove
Pros: 1. Growing organisation
2. Good for CV
3. Great product portfolio

Cons: - Promotions are not always happening based on actual skills and performance
- As a result, working with some of the managers is challenging
- Big corporation, meaning: has the advantages of it but also cons - procedures, processes, roles that could be cut with Occam's Razor, so be prepared for a lot of people approving/planning/executing everything - especially since it's in a highly regulated industry
Advice: Make sure you always are promoting the people that indeed are the best ones for the job.
Pros: - Products, doing something that helps society
- Good comp (though what you negotiate at the beginning will have a big impact but that's true for most companies)
- Possibilities to learn and grow, also to go abroad
- Mature organization 
-  Genentech

Cons: no so much flexibility in the job.  i didn't care for the workspace either, too cramped and a bit run down and in need of a new coat of paint
Advice: managers who engage their subordinates are worth their weight in gold.  perhaps you realized this when you promoted her and we got someone else who had a somewhat different take on life.
Pros: good leadership makes all the difference.  despite the size of our group we had a manager who would take the time to talk to each member at least once a week to try and get an opinion from everyone who was involved in the work.  Gave everyone a feeling they were part ofthe team

Cons: The company does not know who it's good people are
Gets quite nasty when senior women hit the glass ceiling
Very long hours - hard to combine work and life
When they want to get rid of people they apply pressure to take a short term contract, then end it with no termination benefits after careers of 20+ years
Advice: Look back and really try to understand who did the heavy lifting to make a project a success against all the odds, then find out where they are now. They will not still be at Roche, particularly if they are a senior, older female.
Pros: Learning opportunities
Inspirational projects
Brilliant colleagues
Great pay

Cons: - extremely political.
- people focuses on networking to survive more than gaining content as this is more important to stay when reorganizing or changes are happening
- all ideas and strategies are built by external consulting firms (BCG, Deloitte or Mckinsey) so it's more important to be able to have better comm skill (presentation) than being smart.
- quietly hard working people don't get successful at Roche. Go do coffee and attend networking events. that's the way to keep your job at Roche.
Advice: None
Pros: - company provides great support for learning, development and other benefits
- good support during reorganization or you are redundant
- great source of information

Cons: One can also end up in a very old-fashioned team, with micro-managers and non-motivated co-workers who would not leave, nor change because of a semi-public servant attitude.
Advice: Consolidate the Diagnostics business by making more brave decisions and taking long-term business risks to strenghen the pipeline. In the Pharma side, clarify the agnosticity of our PHC strategy. Make stronger and faster moves to overcome the competitors: avoid all-comers startegies, leverage the diagnostics expertise to grant unlock faster market penetration. Embed digital solutions and value-based models.
Pros: Attracts tremendous talent. Very innovative, collaborative, creative, enthousiatic teams, if you have the chance to be in one of them.
Opportunities for career growth in the midst of the transformation and restructuring.

Cons: The salary is not that great  and the current general manager does not put value in the contribution of senior employees. The atmosphere now is that anything new is great.
Advice: Upper management should know not only the market but their employees as well. They should show at least trust in their employees and not be so suspicious on everything. The people in Roche are very dedicated and management must learn how to utilise this.
Pros: The people are very professional and very helpful. The feeling of belonging to a good team is very evident and people are disciplined and dedicated and always willing to extend a helping hand

Cons: Nobody is taking responsibility of their actions. Managers behave like a puppets - their doing what they told to do, no reasonable thinking.
There is no promotion program - once you hired you will stuck in same positions for years.
Advice: Go home :) There is no innovation and no progress cause of you. Every manager I met Europe, USA, Canada - everyone is afraid to make any decision and to take responsibility.
Pros: Nice environment and nice people, very good training package and high level equipment. A lot of traveling and people to meet as this is globally focused company.
Very good company for the begginers,  young people who starts their carrier.

Cons: The job postings for dual students are relatively scarce and unappealing. As far as Grenzach-Wyhlen is concerned, the positions available are almost exclusively assistants. No possibility to go into sales unless you have 3-5 years of experience. Very-trainee oriented (candidates with PhDs)
Advice: Lowering the requirements for sales, as other pharmaceutical companies are doing so as well. Also, do not shift focus entirely towards trainees but concentrate on retaining dual students.
Pros: Continuous exposure to various departments, deeply integrated in the organization. Possibility of placements abroad. Very competitive salary compared to peers, performance and commute bonuses. Participation in a junior company with responsibility to manage an annual budget of 150k

Cons: The only thing I would mention here is that some of the decisions tend to be slow (although this is my first SSC, so don't really have a base for comparison in the industry)
Advice: None
Pros: The culture in our team is welcoming and nurturing. The open-door is not just a policy but practice. Everybody is approachable and helpful. 

You are given the chance to take part in many projects outside of your daily duties, this helps you network, grow and learn. This is actually encouraged but not forced.

Many soft-skills training and function related advancement as well on the needs-basis.  

The work time is very flexible with generous home office options for everyone.

Cons: Each manager I had at Roche was a good individual contributor, often a leader among peers, but a terrible at managing people. Roche has a tendency to promote people who deliver results and view management as a way to give a career path for top performers, instead of carefully considering management roles for people who have skills for the role. This is likely common in most industries, but I found middle managers at Roche to be obsessed with their own personal career ambitions as opposed to being considerate of those of their team. Some were boldly two-faced, showing their best side to their peers and superiors and worst to the team below, and often the only forum to account for this is the 2-year GEOS survey. But often middle managers fire employees to game their own management ranking, which has the added effect of ensuring subordination of those who remain on the team. That said Roche is extremely progressive in their HR policies, I would not be surprised to see them calibrate this over time, and Roche also offers phenomenal leadership development programs and continuing education to help build soft skills. The problem is the self-centered middle managers who are only thinking about their next career step, and a lack of opportunities for candid manager feedback outside of GEOS. Pay is also considerably lower than the market rate in the industry, but career opportunities and benefits are top-notch.
Advice: Consider end-of-year reviews where teams evaluate their manager as well. What I found is that managers are gaming the 2-year GEOS survey where they weed out the ones who are likely to give them low marks and justify it by any means possible, then fake like they care about the team in the lead-up to the survey. Instituting an annual 360 check of the manager, or even biannual, could force those self-centered managers to focus on team needs more consistently.
Pros: Great senior leadership, fantastic colleagues &amp; peers, excellent patient-focused mission, outstanding reputation in the field. Working at Roche will open a lot of doors beyond given the brand and threshold required to gain employment. Everyone in Dia wants to work at Roche, so when jobs become available you're competing against the best of the best.

Cons: - Employer brand is not strong enough for now, many people have  not heard of Roche.
Advice: Thank you for all the opportunities!
Pros: - Good culture, people are generally very friendly &amp; sincere. Employees greet one another all times, regardless of position. 
- Well-being of employees are highly prioritized. Healthy breakfast,  milk and fruits provided EVERYDAY. Plenty of engagement activities every week, at times too much. These activities do bring people closer together tho. 
- Management practices an open culture, employees are encouraged to speak up.
- As a SSC, I must say its' benefits are pretty attractive and competitive. 
- Great purpose: Doing what patients need next. 
- Overall, no regrets and happy to be part of this company.

Cons: Not enough support provided,  often left to do the work of two people and them get blame if work isn't up to standard, get told this work needs to be done by tomorrow,  stay late at office to complete and then told they dont want you working late.
Advice: Have a consistent message. Realise where you are stretched too thin and don't blame the employee for not getting the work done of two people. It's your responsibility to provide support.
Pros: Great pipeline,  stable future, good growth and development opportunities. Good training programme. Well established within industry,  great salary and benefits package.

Cons: Realising business strategy is extremely difficult because of culture and poor leadership. Painfully slow. Wants to be agile but protects its hierarchy. Promotes a "speak up" culture in a superficial way only. Lacks transparency in its performance management process, with advancement generally on basis of managing the "right" relationships rather than acting in the best interests of the business and producing results. Pays lip service to diversity - no real commitment in a substantial way and constantly missing real opportunities to reflect its markets. Talented people often leave or are pushed out. Poor leadership behaviour seems to be rewarded.
Advice: Start listening. Practice what you preach. Hold yourself and others accountable.
Pros: Inspiring mission and solid long-term business strategy. Interesting, challenging work - lots of change. Some wonderful, very talented colleagues - particularly in R&amp;D and product development.

Cons: 1. The company has a history of under-performance - its performance is significantly low as
    compared  to its competitors.
2. More emphasis on physical presence than actual work being done. Don't have deadlines if 
    you already intend to miss/push it. That sends the message that you are not serious.
3. 2-3 hour lunches are a norm rather than a luxury. Coming late and leaving early is 
    fashionable too.
4. The recession saw a lot of good people leave and bad ones stay because of favoritism. Lot of 
    politics, blame-game and favoritism.
5. HR-your job should be to find and RETAIN good workers; not to terminate them based on some 
     man-made, inflexible rules.
Advice: Upper Management - Please stop terrifying people and start listening. Being approachable does not mean giving in.  People like to be heard beyond policies, rules, and guidelines.
Pros: Work is pretty slow, so lot of leisurely time.

Cons: 1) due to the Greek financial crisis , a few years ago the company laid off many people so there is too much workload on those who remained , meaning not the best work life balance for some
2) Open office space incredibly noisy , you just cannot work
Advice: Keep on listening to the people at the lowest level of hierarchy....
Pros: 1) The new German manager is a true leader with impeccable listening skills that has streamlined internal operations
2)  Having worked for Roche is a passport for other companies 
3)  You will get to learn about all the product lines  ,  an innovator , it is a school
4)   While I was there , the CEO and the President had come to talk to us

Cons: management favoritism, poor leadership, inexperienced leadership, inefficient work processes, lack of appreciation for all levels of employees, lack of rewards or recognition for non-managers, poor communication down the line of command, parent company's processes cumbersome, ineffective lab safety program, management out of touch with the front lines
Advice: Do not depend solely on information from line managers.  A lot of information communicated up the chain of command is unsubstantiated and inaccurate, especially concerning day-to-day operations.  Take time to talk to people who are not managers about how things in their group work.  Different perspectives will help the company develop all employees and leverage everyon'es talents.
Pros: Work/life balance, benefits (paid time off, health/dental/vision, social events), innovative products, stimulating day-to-day tasks, managers of certain groups care about their employees, most colleagues are friendly and helpful.

Cons: Daily work is awfully separated - some team members are handling 20-30 issues a day and are still underrated, however another can handle 5 and being thankful and even promoted. 
Team is with a very weak knowledge, no opportunity for expand the knowledge and unfriendly to each other. 
Stakeholders and not supportive, but abusive, offensive. 
Info sharing is absolutely missing at all stages. 
Management is not supportive and not able to support the team because of lack of knowledge.
Salary is lower than market's.
Advice: I would recommend to implement feedbacks to be provided for all the parties, involved into Authorization process. 
Also I would recommend to improve info and best practice sharing.
Also I would suggest to review the communication style of CoE Team.
Pros: Great company values. A lot of opened positions.

Cons: After the recent "integration" the up to 70% of the management is from Genentech.  While I can appreciate the innovation this company has brought in, the management style of some legacy managers coming into new roles at Roche is absolutely inacceptable.  There is absolutely no focus on development and support and people are used and then replaced with "new folks" from the United States.
Advice: You ruining the Roche culture.  The Genentech style management is not plug in play.  The potential impact to people that have been in the company for over 10 years is disastrous.
Pros: Roche has historically been a great company.  It has gone above and beyond guaranteeing the best benefits for its people and focusing on its culture.

Cons: As it is a large company, what you experience from it depends largely your specific unit, and group and team leader or line manager. I you get a competent line manager then you are going to thrive and flourish. But otherwise it is going to be a place you might need to get out of, soon. I know of several case who were in both such scenarios - careers either picked up or was a disastrous move and they quit soon after.
Advice: None
Pros: It is large company, so career progression might be a reasonable expectation and is also often experience. the benefits are good and the portfolio is healthy. It is stable giant of a company and you have a fairy good chance of finding your career in good hands.

Cons: -Very old system and tools, incredible cumbersome processes, very narrow mindset unacceptance of (significant) improvement ideas, with an future outlook.
-Highly hierarchical,  too much politics around to consider, and hidden interests under the projects like "people care, people development."
Advice: -Consider and pay attention to employee that have a brain, but feel so limited by the created environment. They care for business, do the work and have an opinion, not only nod their head! They are massively leaving the place!
-Take meaningful decisions,  and start to learn  and understand what your people are actually doing ! 
-Allow a performance rating based on fair criteria and apply it to all !
Pros: -Additional benefits, location, cantine, reputation in industry.

Cons: Due to internal politics life can be hard and management decisions can affect your work negatively. 
Many unnecessary project persons in the HQ who sometimes hold back information. 
Sometimes it is unclear who is responsible for what. 
There is a big distance between business and support. 
Many system changes which caused longer and slow processes and double work.
No creative ideas anymore.
Advice: None
Pros: I was lucky during the years as I had the chance to progress and improve my skills by new challenges. Because of my hard work I was recognised many times and also promoted. In the first years my manager took care of the team, our processes and responsibilities and also appreciated us. (Then I experienced the opposite as well)

Cons: Not sure where to start sadly. This is a company that should have been proud of its culture...instead its allowed a very US centric model ‘eat’ in to everything that worked and was managed well. Biggest downfall is lack of integrity and transparency - especially in PD.  Trust from employees of 10+yrs service has GONE. HR is shockingly bad too.
Advice: Yes, companies need to grow and adapt to the changing environment...but you need to bring your emplyees on board  through transparency, trust and integrity. Neither of which have been demonstrated over the last 6+yrs. Consequently don’t be surprised when people walk after being committed for many years.
Pros: Passionate about bringing innovative and effective drugs to patients.

Cons: Unstable senior management. Opportunities very much concentrated in San Francisco. Quality of life of many employees severely impacted following merge with Genentech and Operational Excellence initiative. People much more afraid to speak out. Employees are more encouraged to say what management want to hear independantly of the mid-long term consequences for the company.
Advice: Listen more employees. Re-consider the co-location model of complete therapeutic area for drug development. This would help to keep talented people. Integrate more non US view on business decision. Integrate market reality, politicical environment in addition to science in drug development decision is necessary to avoid new major drawbacks.  Continue to promote high values and people.
Pros: Many opportunities on careers, large portfolio of interesting drugs. Multi-cultural environment in particular in HQ Europe. Willingness to take care of employees. Promotion of values and not only of money.

Cons: As a software developer you will be kicked off the market as their technology is completely unknow for the majority.

Agile is used but many times the way of working is closer to Kanban.

As a company, they reorganize their structure from time to time and promise to be better and so on, but at the end of the day everything stays the same.

Promotion is hard as new positions open very infrequently and many times they're already assigned to someone once they're published.

You end up realising you're trapped in a cage made of gold from which it's difficult to escape.
Advice: Make the organization changes more visible to all employees. 

Promotions should be more frequent.
Pros: It's a great place to work as they offer many benefits and in general colleagues are nice and make you feel comfortable. Good salary, cantine almost for free, flexitime, homeworking, and so on. It's all gold from the inside.

Cons: Very negative energy and big exodus of good people either being laid off or leaving to better companies/opportunities.  Field people are not valued.  Constant fear of being laid off, restructure and change just for "change".
Advice: Find ways to value good people.  Increase transparency and promote from within.  Sometimes fostering a good culture is the little things that can make a big difference.  Ie no travel for business meetings on Sundays, Christmas get togethers,
Pros: Smart people, great products, This is a great company to go to if you want to work in specialty biotech and have no/little experience.  Great starting point as it is very difficult to get into some of the other companies unless you have a solid track record. Roche will give you a chance because of the vast turnover in an area with normally little turnover.

Cons: The team I worked with was awesome but there is no communication between middle management on project status. One day we are working on a particular project and the next day we switch and just to keep things interesting we switch back on the third day. Too reactive and not proactive. Maybe its the lack of resources and the fact that decisions are made by a bunch of suits that have no clue about the actual work and only care about the bottom line.
Advice: Please stop hiring contractors. There are too many. And please understand that employees that are continuously working under the assumtion they will be let go at any moment will not commit to roche the way you expect. The employee makes the company.
Pros: The only reason to work here is to get a good foundation and understand the methods of a proven player within the biotech/pharma industry.

Cons: Carrer opportunities are limited. Sales experience is required to progress within organisation. Very sales driven affiliate, sometimes lack of strategy and concentrating on delivering numbers.  Work-life balance is rather poor, it is expected of you constantly to take on new challenges and overachieve. Roche is not interested in keeping people regardles of your track record and seniority. Very hard training on Roche values, if you don't fit in, they will get rid of you rather quickly. If you wish to progress within organisation be prepared to move to Germany or Switzerland and learn German.
Advice: 
Pros: Friendly and helpful corporate culture, good products, company is a market leader or even a market dominator in many areas. Good sales, marketing and supporting structure. Very good facilities on site- great office, cantine, bar, free gym, free bikes. Stimulating to develop yourself and working on your weaknesses.

Cons: Salaries are not competitive, progression is based on likeability and who you know, alot of managers  unqualified technically therefore clueless about subject matter and can't support new starters. Alot of papering over the cracks rather than dealing with problems, too many meetings, primitive systems therefore poor data.  excel sheets used in conjunction as the systems aren't fit for purpose so alot of duplication.silos and  big disconnects between global and local teams doing the same thing, and there is even inconsistencies between global teams working on the same molecule.
Advice: Listen to people's ideas and experiences, focus more on passion about the science and molecules. Experiences from outside of Roche can be invaluable and save you time.
Pros: Nice facilities, all the tools you need to be productive are available, benefits good

Cons: Slow to get anything done
Some horrible managers
MBOs - This is a work that you need to do outside of your day-to-day job... for most people at Roche, their day-to-day job takes longer than the 37.5 hours you're paid for... then to try and fir MBOs just adds insult to injury.
Advice: Scrap the MBO program, it just stresses people out. If you got something at the end of it (i.e.certificates etc.), then fine... Oh, and your pay-rise and bonus (which should be linked to how you do your ACTUAL JOB) is linked to them too.
Pros: Big Company
All of the great benefits that working for a large company should bring (inc. Company Car, Health Insurance etc.)
Really nice offices

Cons: -The company constantly puts the wrong people in management positions. Getting ahead is all about networking and who you know, not about your performance. The result is a whole rotten pot of the same type of manager - micro manager, narcissistic, insecure and no personal skills.
-The global department IS NOT global..... not many employees who have international experience, or even global management skills for that matter.
-Not an EOE. Male dominated in Germany
Advice: Offer a career development plan and assess the line managers ... regular feedback sessions with the direct reports should be done to see how the line manager is doing his job!
Pros: -good salary and benefits
-extra vacation
-Just hired an American head of diagnostics who has some good ideas
-Severin is making good progress

Cons: The managing style is highly hierarchical. The manager not necessary are very aware of the state of the art techniques ( even not familiar with the field), yet they would micro-manage every step of you. 
Lack of knowledge even on very basic practices in domains such as computer science, machine learning, or data science.  


Minor:
There is a mismatch between what is advertised on their web page, and what they would offer you in reality. 
As an engineer, you are not equipped with high-end laptops. 
You are not going to have an workstation or a stationary desk at work (only a laptop).  
As a temporary employee, you have no new year bonus or any benefit as a permanent employee. 
If you are not an EU citizen you will mainly get an L permit to work in Switzerland for a temporary position which is not a good permit.
Advice: None
Pros: you could work remotely ( once or two times a week), and you could have a balance between life and work.

Cons: Sometimes communication can be difficult through the departments, mainly due to cultural reasons i believe.
Advice: Keep on doing what you are doing so well.
Pros: I have been working in various Pharma companies since 2000, Roche is by far the best company.   I am here since April 2015 and have not even one negative situation to report.  Sure not everything works perfectly but the mentality and the attitude is so positive and always working towards success and improvement.  I instantly felt included and given the opportunity to develop towards where i wanted to go.  I feel that Roche actually cares for the employees well being in every sense.  I am really happy to work for Roche.

Cons: - The payment is way bellow average for swiss standards on internship salaries.
- No career development nor support from any department to get a job after the internship is over (in any department). You can network and work as hard as you want, the response is usually: "we have a lot of applicants which will have more experience than you, so even if you worked for us, chances are you will not get the job".
- Pride themselves on culture and values, but there are no mechanisms to ensure there is no discrimination in the workplace beyond the percentages of hires they use for marketing.
Advice: None
Pros: You get paid as a student and get work experience.

Cons: Not really.  
Very commercially oriented and not a lot of decision power when one is working at local affiliate level and not at the Swiss headquarters.  So one has to be OK with this whole thing of executing tasks coming from above, sometimes working in urgency without time to think, and having to follow all these corporate KPIs and annual project plans.
Advice: Try and embrace more the modern management style by empowering your people to become leaders of their own careers.
Pros: A very nice employer: still an agreeable family culture (these things become rare nowadays), a lot of considerations for people and possibilities to change functions across departments.

Cons: Roche Latín America doesn’t have the same leadership style than the rest of the regions. Leaders are selfish and worried about their own benefit, very political and cold. It is not inspiring as it is in international or Basel. Mainly because of the Commercial, GMs and Human Resources people at the regional level, it is known that they even have affairs with employees.
Advice: You should change leaders in the Latin America region , and bring a new generation of managers that really reflect the Roche culture globally.
Pros: Leadership is a strategic pillar, the CEO is an inspirational leader and with a strong focus on people. Is it the most wonderful company, with a strong purpose and great pipeline.

Cons: It’s really hard to get things done internally. There is little accountability and ownership of timelines. As a result it is ‚nice people’ who are considered good not the employees who really get things done. Political and not very focused on learning. Settled and rigid even though management try to implement massive changes to get things done faster. Too much focus on blaming vendors without taking responsibility and ownership for the internal mess.
Advice: Recognize hard work and expertise. Promote accountability and learning. Simplify systems and procedures. Mean it. Shake it up. There are some old not so competent dead wood out there.
Pros: Nice office vibe, good people, great portfolio.

Cons: Career progression is slow
Work life balance is not easy to achieve all the time.
Very few perm positions 
Avoid the soup
Advice: Please continue with the training at all levels , it is the people that make the company. If you want the best people then they should be trained by the best. This also insures consistency and less time spent on deciding how to proceed with  tasks. If every company relies on staff being trained by another company then at some point there will be lack in trained staff and no one left to pass on  knowledge and skills.
Pros: Great Place to work. 
Colleagues are helpful 
Training is good

Cons: The office at Welwyn Garden City is lovely but I feel like it needs to be nearer to the hub of things so should be in London. Transport there is awkward too and the town it's in is very expensive and busy
Advice: Try and be at your desk a little more. I know you're busy and in meetings but I can sometimes go for a few days without seeing you.
Pros: Brilliant workplace, amazing atmosphere, friendly and welcoming people, belief in their motto "doing now what patients need next", feels like you are positively contributing to helping people, nice balance between work and socializing, ability to develop your career, good salary

Cons: Extremely political organization with very conservative views of what it takes to become successful in the marketplace.  They provide lip service about wanting to hear the opinion of employees … bin practice, the complete opposite.
Advice: Leadership has become a very incestuous club with promotions coming more from who you know than what you know and have accomplished.  Need to go outside the organization and bring in talent with actual experience and record of success in the diabetes community.
Pros: Benefits and pension plan are generally better than the industry at large.  Health plan is very generous and covers things that most will not.

Cons: Myself I do not see any cons for Roche as  a research and development company. If I see some cons is that it sometimes lets itself be typical very large company where everybody needs to follow the majority and prescribed trends.
Advice: Roche is in general very solid company with special emphasis to modern drug research and development and has many successes in drug development especially in difficult areas like oncology
Pros: Roche is generally very good place to work  especially in the research and development departments but also in other like IT. Roche is concentrating on very challenging areas of drug development and has many successes there

Cons: Managers assigned in affiliates need to be coached in term of leadership 
Absence of Roche culture in affiliates especially in Africa, unfortunately some of them are operating with local culture which impact employees’ motivation and explain the turnover

Country manager is the only decision maker

Stressful environment for some core functions
Advice: To focus more on leadership 
to be close to employees and to enhance their listening skills 
Headquarter has to work on the enhancement of Roche culture in their affiliate
Pros: Good work environment where employee can rely on the support of the company to offer him all needed training to support him and to achieve his result
Performance is rewarded 
Excellent HR community

Cons: Bad management decision created a huge waste of time and money. For instance, business managers deciding technology with no background.
Too much politics.
Each entity is isolated from others, no possibilities to change project or location.
No career or development plan. 
No transparency created a lot of rumors and frustration. 
When people started leaving the company, they did not try to evaluate the reason.
Advice: Pay attention to people, they create your products. Don't make decisions with no rational behind (and share the rational).
Provide roadmap and clear directions, not only short term plans.
Pros: Working environment because of multicultural teams. Strong culture & values in some entities but not in mine.

Cons: It claims to be in an exciting period of transition - trying to become agile and creative however this is being delivered on a budget 
Appalling dated culture persists - all forms of discrimation overtly demonstrated by senior staff and widely tolerated/ignored (lean HR)
Surrounded by very expensive places to live
Recruitment and retention issues due to the above issues and recent redundancy program
A number of staff promoted well beyond their level of ability also due to above
Far too many badly managed internal staff moves leaving gaping holes in the structure
Agile principles inexpertly and badly applied - leading to inconsistent practice. Combined with the other factors something of a chaotic shambles ...
Advice: *** Well resourced diversity training &amp; transition supporting required stat ***
Pros: Large employer
Reasonable benefits package (- although an expensive location so not so great)
Some Californian influence, sleep pods, subsidised food etc.

Cons: The biggest con is the sallary, completely out of range. The company has plans to adequate the sallary considering the job description and not only the job title, but we have not seen anything concrete yet.
Bureaucracy in the processes is also an issue that the company is trying to resolve.
Advice: Continue with the Global Survey of employees' satisfaction, and improve the communication between HQ and affiliates.
Pros: Roche is engaged in innovation, and ethics really run the business. It has a very modern and adequate workplace and the company is committed in improving the employees' satisfaction

Cons: A lot of people bring a lot of opinions and individuals may use the great platform of the company to play their own games but this can happen in small or creative companies too
Advice: Use a better HR process in order to bring talented people. Take care of diversity and not just talk about it. Move away from "female-quote" and pick the right people for the right job(s). Listen to your middle-management, they usually do the "dirty work".
Pros: Wonderful company with so many employee benefits. Many options and places to work and if you can cope with the flavor of a global company you are all set.

Cons: The disadvantages that Roche has, for me, would be the bias that people have towards the pharmaceutical industry, for which as a company I do not see any problem.
Advice: None
Pros: When referring to the advantages we must denote that the global development that Roche offers year after year is one of the main goals for which it makes it an extraordinary company, as well as the development of new technologies that keep it at the forefront and as a benchmark. from the area, just look at the list of essential drugs that the UN draws up, to be able to denote the great development that the company provides worldwide.

Cons: Developement possibilities are poor. Need to find a sponsor to make a career - good luck.
No development plans. Attitude is that "everybody wants to work for Roche". Retention is not seen as important. Only few selected individuals will eventually (luck, relationships) make a career.
Advice: Stop seeing yourself as the only human asset. Start valuing talents and to retain people by offering development paths not only for a selected few. Start measuring and placing importance on people management.
Pros: Responsiblity give quickly and early.
Freedom to manage ones own job.
Competent colleaques (mostly)
Very good address for your CV (professionally acting company)

Cons: extremely unprofessional management, even the lowest level managers think that they are already CEO and should not engage in operations. Huge amount of people that are on the same position for a decade and think that they know everything, no learning sharing culture, no appreciation. Speaking out, courage and   change are enemies, and whoever dares to talk about it is attached. Extremely slow moving people and processes.
Advice: Come down from your Olympus and improve the communication in your teams. Leadership is not only talks and high words about how great you are.
Pros: compensation package, even though your bonus only depends on the years in company

Cons: The technological infrastructure is really poor (they do not have one comprehensive ERP system, many separate softwares instead) which yields to ineffective and unproductive internal procedures and this inevitably affects the work-life balance negatively.
They have a good HR system for career development but it is not tracked effectively by HR.
Advice: None
Pros: Excellence in R&D affects whole organisation in a positive way. Being apart of a company who provides the most innovative drugs for patients with serious diseases feels really satisfying
Compensation and benefits are competitive compared to pharma market.
The company gives value to having diversity  in the organisation therefore they highly promote international assignments, the existence of women within management teams etc.

Cons: As a result of success parts of the commercial organisation in particular have become to big, and at times getting things done relies on going through multiple committees and approvals.
Advice: Continue to focus on changing the mindset of the organisation to do things faster with less hassle.
Pros: The quality of people Roche attracts is amazing, over the 7 years I worked worked with intelligent pragmatic individuals.

Plenty of  career opportunities, it is a big company, being mobile is however important to unlocking your way up the ladder.

A lot of training and focus on developing leaders.

Cons: PROCURE TO PAY DEPARTMAENT KULALA LUMPUR MALAYSIA.
there is no human behaviour.worst behaviour then animal.if someone stuck in any problem will never go from there but will be get out or exist from company.there is racism unfair not equal treat.there is no standard business policy in the company.it better work in small enterprise atleast have respect and better human behaviour.there are a lot of good companies and shared service for employee.im just wonder statement of company is doing now what patient  need next but inside company have racism favoritism biasness how can care patient where cant care employee. think millions time apply any job here.
Advice: impliment is standard of business conduct policy ASAP who will safe employee withou racism favoritism and biasness.
Pros: THERE IS NO EVEN GOOD THING.

Cons: Too brand focused over recent years rather than customer focused. especially cross portfolio in oncology.  Used to embrace a diverse range of styles, more than other companies but this is changing to a certain type now.  Lost a lot of talent in the restructure last year so is having to relearn some lessons.
Advice: Focus on the customer more.  Embrace different kinds of leadership and individuals.
Pros: Fantastic portfolio, innovative approach, great offices, talented people.  New structure is empowering more people and generating swifter decision making. Emphasis on leadership is strong with leadership commitments being clear and part of all leaders objectives.

Cons: Too endless to list in this department. Worst thing is the horrific management. Worked in this horrific department for several years hoping things would get better. Roche is a fantastic company to work for but unfortunately you experience a company through the department you’re in and this is a rotten one.
It is incredibly political and competitive with people ready to stab you in the back at any moment. 
The worst aspect of this place is easily the management team as the culture bleeds from the top down. They lack integrity, are not understanding or fair at all and see people merely as pawns to milk everything out of; with 2 of the male managers being the worst. Accusations are constant and you will regularly have to defend yourself. Management are only interested in benefiting themselves selfishly and are more than happy to throw you under a bus to make themselves look better. The manager you get will define your experience of the job, as approaches are inconsistent. 
Worklife balance is non-existent in this place with people being encouraged to work overtime for no compensation everyday until 11pm-2/3am and during weekends. 
You will not get just credit for your effort and results but instead praise and opportunities go to the management’s favourites regardless of their actual ability and performance.  
This department might be alright as a stepping stone or learning experience for a short period of time but I would not recommend it for any long term option. All in all this is a toxic work environment and not a good place for your mental health. I have seen many talented individuals fall foul of this place.
Advice: There is no point me writing anything here as they have no desire to listen or change - they only like to look as if they are listening.
Pros: Flexible working as you can work from home 3 days a week and they have flexitime
Excellent training for you to do your job
High standards of work
Development opportunities. Though it should be noted that some managers treat development opportunities as a bargaining chip e.g. “you can only work on project x if you do it in your own time on top of your normal work” if they know you are interested in something and may concede to their request, whereas someone else who wasn't interested in it would just be given time to work on it.

Cons: The Roche leadership approach is going "back to the future" -- that is, the leadership teams are increasingly white, middle-aged, German speaking men. The CEO has even told employees that the company can't find qualified women applicants (nonsense). For all the talk (and there is a lot of it) about transforming the company for the future, it's not going to get there with the current leadership mindset. 
Office politics have gotten worse than ever. Turnover is increasing sharply, as people are either pushed out or leave because they can't take the politics anymore. Almost every department is restructuring with layoffs.
Middle management is poor. The speak-up culture is on paper only. Try it in the real world and you'll see how quickly you get penalised for it. 
Women are fast disappearing from leadership positions.
The ridiculous and counter-productive emphasis on speaking German for global roles when German speaking is not remotely necessary. It only promotes more cronyism among the white, German-speaking middle-aged men running the company. Diversity and inclusion have been thrown under the bus.
Roles are being downgraded with lower salaries and bonuses. At global headquarters, it's almost impossible to advance without being a native or near-native German speaker, even if German is only marginally related to the actual job
HR is not there to help you. Ever.
Substandard IT tools and technology
Advice: Stop insisting that global roles be filled by German speakers. What good is German in LATAM,  the Middle East and Asia Pacific? 
Walk the talk in the Leadership Commitments
Clear out middle management driven by their own ambitions and not the good of the company
Listen to employees before making IT decisions. Stop forcing employees to use substandard tools and  ignoring their complaints
If you're not going to listen to employees, then be honest and stop the employee surveys. What's the point if you're not going to act on any of the issues raised?
Stop making employees pay the price for poor management decisions
Pros: Meaningful work. If there's one standout thing about the company, it's that the majority of employees are genuinely committed to improving health care around the world.

Cons: Some of the company structures and bureaucracy are quite limiting. You should expect a super tanker - it takes a long time to change course, start initiatives etc.
Advice: Scale back on the use of corporate jargon and management fads, both due to its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium.
Pros: It's a professional environment and they treat their employees well. If you do well in your job, you will have a lot of different opportunities in the organization, as long as you are mobile or at HQ in Basel.

Cons: As in many other companies that are doing well - there is a certain resistance to change. Things seem 'perfect' on the outside but when you look closer you see that there are some things that need to improve.
Advice: Consider how we may improve information channels and stakeholder management between marketing, medical and market access.
Pros: People that work at Roche are proud to say that they work for the company. There is a sense of a family feeling here as employees seem to truly care about each other and the positive impact we have on the society.

Cons: Incompetent management - lack of knowledge and experience in medical device industry! I could repeat this 100 times. This is a HUGE problem for Roche PVT!
Intrigues and political rubbish - personal loyalty is much more valuable than expertise and knowledge.
Too many useless meetings, total misunderstanding of Agile and Scrum in particular. Declaring Agile values while using classical command and control style. Effectively applying 'best' management anti-patterns.
Advice: Reinforce Roche PVT management with experts in medical device industry who are able to implement Roche DCC and industry standards in practice.
Pros: Very good work and balance.
Good tools and equipment.
Nice location and comfortable office in Waiblingen.

Cons: Medical labs are high pressure environments, especially in hospitals where the majority of lab techs work, according to the MHA. Precision and accuracy in managing and recording lab results is critical in health care. Medical professionals rely on quality lab results to communicate with patients and to determine diagnosis and recommended courses of action. This pressure, combined with higher amounts of testing in busier environments, can overwhelm you if we don't cope well with pressure.
Advice: None
Pros: Medical laboratory technologist skilled in performing, conducting, and analyzing laboratory assays and resolving complex clinical and instrumental problems. Organized and proficient at precisely analyzing detail-oriented analytical, hardworking and highly motivated.

Cons: The HR Talent management is absolutely awful. There are no career developments supported by HR, there are constant re-organisation where you are obsolete from one day to the other, applying to new internal positions takes months. With the moto that your development is your own responsibility, you have to do everything by yourself without professional support.
Advice: Your people is your first asset... live it in addition to have it to your commitments
Pros: This is a great company, with opportunity to do almost everything which is possible in the industry. A very flexible and engaging work mindset, wonderful facilities, great colleagues.

Cons: - too little work, which stifles learning as your senior colleagues will not pass on their knowledge for fear of you taking over their jobs
- departments are too specialised e.g. QC is further separated to 6 subdivisions and for QA is further welted down
Advice: Hire less people. And also, be sincere in training trainees if you take them in.
Pros: - excellent benefits such as an extensive medical coverage
- due to the history of the Singapore site as Genentech, a couple of Ho-Hos (get together as a company) to celebrate
- good higher management

Cons: 1. make sure u can survive 
2. how? suck up to manager, avoid mistakes (extra careful in anything that you do)
3. else, be ready to be kick out of the door (they have their methods)
4. if you wanna climb up fast, u need to know people and have visibility. Communication, networking, and social skills are an asset here.
Advice: Roche have many core values,  motto etc. Make sure your people practice it, else they are all for show only.
Pros: 1. free breakfast
2. many benefits - epf, flex, sports activities, insurance etc

Cons: Compared to other pharma companies, people stay in roles for a much longer time before opportunities present. It is great for stability but can create complacency. It is not such an issue as they are located on the Northern Beaches and people often choose to work there due to geography and lifestyle but moving to a company in Macquarie Park I was amazed at how many people with less development and experience had moved within corporations to senior positions.
Advice: Move from Dee Why and create more accountability and less complacency
Pros: Great development and great products.

Cons: Working in healthcare brings positive attention but also many questions on the high price policy of our products.
Advice: Don't loose keeping an eye on the existing employees working hard day by day, rather than more and more focus on newbies. You can count on the established ones, can you count as much on the promises of the others as well? And please don't underestimate that someone needs and is doing the daily jobs of the newbies when they are sent into all those projects.
Pros: Really doing a lot for having employees motivated. Some aspects are on a lower level since Genentech integration but still top ranked.

Cons: Lack of vision in shaking the world for patients, despite all the PR.
Reality of career development is completely different from HR policies and brochures.
Constant stream of redundancies implemented quietly - away from media and rest of employees.
Individuals treated like numbers, which is sad as this is symptomatic of the culture change started 5 years ago.
Advice: Stop believing your own spin and setting short-term goals.  Think about the company and your legacy - for the sake of patients and stop hemorrhaging great talent that you'll never replace!
Pros: Great company doing great things.

Cons: Most of the time, promotion to managerial roles are not based on capabilities, but on service duration.Longer you are in the company, better is your chance.  This is resulting in mismanagement and frustration in teams.
Advice: Kindly listen to feedback from team members.
360 degree feedback system might help. Please allow 
a) Team to rate  their  line managers (preferably anonymous, to avoid conflict). 
b) Peers to rate the line managers to  reduce the trouble making attitude and improve the collaboration among teams.
Pros: Good work opportunities,Good Colleagues, Average work pressure. Good work-life balance.

Cons: The "system" is quite complicated with many levels of complexity.
Advice: Continue giving great guidance and career support. Focus on giving an overview of all the systems before delving into details when employees first start.
Pros: The culture at Roche is extremely supportive, and I have yet to experience any office politics or cliquey-ness. The work-life balance and benefits are excellent. They really care about your career path and  guide your development . They even encourage you to explore different aspects of the company in case you'd like to switch positions.  I feel extremely lucky to work with such kind and competent people.

Cons: 1. Greater and greater emphasis on centralized processes that lead to edicts from the "Leadership".

2.The point above leads to managers implementing local solutions but framing results to look like they are the great ideas the "Leadership" has been so kind to share and insist we implement.

3. Old ideas are re-badged as new. New bosses never ask if an idea has been tried before. They just assume they have best ideas.

4. "Leadership" that asks for feed back but does not act on it and sidelines personnel who give feedback that does not toe the party line.

5. After a staff survey showed they were heading in the wrong direction for staff satisfaction 3 years ago, latest survey shows they have scored even lower for the same issues raised 3 years ago.

6. Are perceived as arrogant by customers and competitors.

7. They pay less than their competitors
Advice: 1. You are good at developing talent but you keep losing your best people because you do not respect them and you frustrate them till they have no option but to leave.

2. Your pay is crap. Staff stopped believing in your "industry compensation benchmarks" ages ago. You do not pay as well as your "real" competitors, period.  You demand results in the 95th percentile so your pay should reflect that.

3. 7-8 years of sustained growth did not come about by accident. Start to respect the staff you have.

4. It is not a good sign when staff are so indifferent they tell you the "Leadership", face to face that you are doing ok, yet your own survey shows you are sliding further back! It shows your staff are tired of giving feedback that is not acted on.
Pros: 1.Big blue chip company with many global opportunities to move a progress your career across the world.

2. Looks good on your CV.

3. Relatively stable company in a difficult industry.

4. Friendly staff.

5. Good staff training.

6. Nice office facilities.

Cons: The culture is interpreted differently depending on which department and which manager. Theoretically you can speak up when things are wrong however it is frowned upon and managers don't have the time to actively listen. People are too worried to speak up about inefficiency and how it can be improved. "How" you conduct yourself  is the number one priority in 360 feedback,  therefore people are reluctant to speak up for fear of appearing confronting the status quo.  It appears that management training is not always effective, some are  rapidly promoted  managers  overseeing big teams  who are  under pressure to progress trial conduct. These middle managers lack understanding of site or study operations or regulatory expectations but manage people who work in clinical trial project oversight.  This makes people feel over whelmed with lack of support and clarity and poor onboarding. The on boarding is inadequate given the complexity of the organisation, lack of middle management knowledge of operations, and the numerous systems and platforms. This can  leave an expert CSM or contractor feeling like a rookie when they first join Roche. People stay because it's easy to move on to another role whilst enjoying the benefits. If you play your cards right, keep your head down, work around inefficiencies  and make sure all the right managers know you and  love you, you get ahead. This is what is meant by the "how" in real terms.
Advice: Eagle eye on manager behaviour and really actively listen and promote a transparent culture of feedback and speaking up.  Global Employee Opinion Surveys speak volumes. Recycling internal  talent around means that fresh outlook and ideas are lacking. Listen to the advice from new starters  and to employee feedback.  Doing things in the same way never yields different results.
Pros: Theoretically the culture and values are fantastic (courage, integrity, agility, collaboration, people first) , the benefits are great, good facilities that promote high productivity with on site wellness centre. The company does genuinely promote a good work life balance. Lots of in-house promotion means that the opportunities are abundant.

Cons: As expected of big Pharma, multiple layers of management
Communication from upper management could be better though if you have a good line manager, she/he will more than make up for this where they can
Sometimes difficult to progress depending on the state of the department - resourcing was difficult at times, therefore workload could be very high
Advice: None
Pros: Great company with visionary leadership
Great bonus and benefits
Work from home options
My job offered me the chance to gain lots of experience which looks great on my CV
Company is very open to moving between departments if the opportunities arise and line managers are expected to be supportive towards this.

Cons: Roche has grown from many acquisitions and always preserved innovation. Downside is a very strong and sometimes counterproductive complexity and decentralisation. Stakeholder management is a full time job. However this is recognised and on the way for change.
Advice: Reward behaviors: truly authentic leaders, authentic diversity of thinking, and agility.
Pros: Roche is all about patients and science, and that makes a huge difference to many. Number one in sustainable development for a decade, and it's focus on people, culture, and agility has been remarkable over the past years. Roche prepared his leadership for VUCA and this helped a lot in 2020.

Cons: Constant restructuring and transformation leading to low morale, confusion, and a sense that the senior management care only about themselves and shareholders. Roche should return to the time where it looked after its employees. I fear that the decline in the company’s treatment of employees will weaken its culture, resulting in an exodus of talent to competitors and smaller biotech. The result could be a corresponding decline in financial performance and innovation.
Advice: None
Pros: Highly skilled people, empathetic culture, lots of opportunities, collaborative, great benefits and work-life balance.

Cons: After merge with Genentech  (USA) European or other experience / credentials /education is less recognized and reworded by management when compare to the USA experience and education.
Advice: After merge with Genentech  (USA) European or other experience / credentials /education is less recognized and reworded by management when compare to the USA experience and education.
Pros: Very good company, good working environment, good live/work balance, leader in the field, knowledge / information sharing encouraged by senior management. After merge with Genentech  (USA) our USA ounterparts bring excellent and remarkable scientific and medical expertise to the global company.

Cons: It can be a bit intimidating at an entry-level position. There is a lot of work to do and a very steep learning curve.
Advice: Provide more guidance and mentorship to younger employees in terms to where to go to ask questions.
Pros: The work environment is very comfortable, from the spacious cubicles filled with plants and artwork on request, to the snacks and coffee, and the many breaks you can take yourself or as a team. Everyone communicates well and is very respectful, regardless of your level and seniority.

Cons: In Australia the leadership group is very internally focussed - a lot of internal change to balance the books.  I feel they have lost sight of the clinician and the employee.
Advice: Find a way to have fun again whilst engaging your staff.  There has been years of take, take, take - do more with less - lighten up and listen to your customer facing people.
Pros: Roche has excellent products that change lives.  Discussing the products with clinicians allows scientifically interesting conversations and provides a motivation to work hard every day.

Cons: The company keeps reinventing for the last 5 years. Till date they dont have a standard business model. They pay high, only because they will not get well informed candidates. The sell employees to Indian companies along with their products. Arrogant MD and HR is a team of poisonous attitude. This year they made the highest redundancy in the name of getting closer to patients, but went away from its own employees. Many were affected in pandemic and as a company which claims so much standards, should have not done this.
Advice: Keep your foot clear and focus on external customers rather than writing theses about business models with cluster heads, who dont see day light.
Pros: Salary, policies, office ambience, learning opportunities

Cons: People very set in their ways of working want be be a more agile organisation however don't have the process in place , there lot of clever people however no starter finisher
Advice: Leadership need ensure that there new ways of working is clear defined as a new employee need understand the culture and mindset and behaviours of Roche and the support and guidance is given
Pros: People are very friendly and make feel welcome , Roche as a company is patient centric and do what patient need next.

Cons: Communication from management could be improved. If you have a problem with your management HR is not supportive at all. Processes sometimes can be too complex and impenetrable.
Advice: People is your most valuable asset which is often voiced but sometimes and at some departments it is rarely felt. Not just say it, walk the talk!
Pros: Interesting projects and assignments to different locations around the globe. Good to see an industry leader in personalized healthcare. Good work-life balance. Ambitious plans for future.

Cons: - not very agile - same as many large companies
- Slow recruitment processes
Advice: - communicate more and earlier
- standardize things, much especially regarding training and career development is depending to much on you managers goodwill
Pros: - fair company to employers
- good benefits
- CSR is really in scope
- good working climate, "Du-Kultur"
- work-life-balance can or can not be good - you are responsible
- career opportunities generally very good - however you are responsible and you need your manager to support you aspirations
- managers can or can not be good, same as everywhere

Cons: Very minimal merit increase. Even if you're a performer, it doesnt guarantee a nice merit increase. Uniform was well, not so impressive as per client. Minimal HMO coverage.
Advice: Basepay is way too low. Not competitive with other Product specialist from other multinational companies.
Pros: Work life balance is attainable, its a personal strategy. Provided tools for the trade are at Average (1.3 MT car, unlimited gas, allowance for parking and tolls (official days only), phone, lines, tablets/laptop).

Cons: As per the sales executive Responsibility need at least 1-2 persons who will be responsible for Merchandising & Order Bookings.
Advice: Recruit people's who will be responsible more on Order Bookings & Merchandising.
Pros: Team work Co operation Ethical &professional.Good work culture and The team co ordination are quite good.Best part of the "Diabetes segment" is retailers getting more margins it describes that our company is Growing with the hands of our Retailers where they can also growing.

Cons: A global company so the inevitable early / late meetings across time zones. Decision making can be very slow due to everyone wanting to have their say and overly complicated organisational structures. Complicated dynamics between functions and project teams meaning that best practice often not adopted. Cumbersome HR processes.
Advice: Simplify HR processes
Pros: Great global company to work for; offer global mobility for talented staff who are interested in experiencing different cultures.

Cons: Politics, hidden personal agendas, slander and gossip at their most sophisticated forms, really poor culture, especially in the Greek affiliate over the last 5 years
Advice: Do not perceive everyone that does not support your hidden personal agenda (like all your direct reports do) as your enemy, there are people that can work and prosper without personal agendas and politics...
Pros: If you are coming from Switzerland or USA , you have good opportunities to grow. Good Benefits and work-life balance. It used to be a company with good culture, too ...

Cons: Career development depends on your personal relation with the management.
Lack of honesty and transparency from the management.
Vital decisions about your role and career are taken without discussing it with the employer.
Lack of stability &amp; high turn over since 2012.
Lack of "genuine" diversity.
Promotions are based on personal relataions, like &amp; dislike, &amp; not based on your performance and achievements.
Lack of experience and maturity from certain employees at vital positions.
Your  "NATIONALITY" plays a big role in your development.
Advice: None
Pros: Great Products  to work with.
Compensation and allowances.
Bonus.
Was The Best Copmany to work for until 2012.

Cons: Management doesn't address the things that are not right or going wrong. They don't say anything to the senior staff within your team that demoralize and patronize you because they are afraid the senior staff will leave the team and take all the knowledge with them leaving the department in a bad place. Poor training structure and no support. HR are not helpful either and don't take complaints about managers seriously. They always side with the managers over everything. 
One rule for person and another rule someone else. No consistency.
Advice: Take complaints about managers seriously and stop letting them get away with everything. Do not tolerate bullying as it leaves people scarred mentally for life.
Pros: Overall package and benefits are competitive

Cons: Many within the company complain that things move slowly; they move much faster than in some much smaller companies I worked for.
Advice: Keep up the great work.
Pros: The company culture includes:
- Strong empowerment
- Focus on people, especially attracting and retaining outstanding talent
- Focus on creating value – especially for the customer and the patient
- Courage and ambition

Strong culture of empowerment causes several nice effects:
- it attracts smart and engaged people
- it makes room for you to pick up your own extra challenges, if you want to
- it promotes healthy internal competition between departments and projects
- it establishes an attitude focused on creating value, and not making your boss happy

Focus on people includes:
- Extremely attractive working conditions: broad trust and freedom, various perks, you're free to buy whatever tools you feel like you need, within reason.
- Competitive salaries.
- Bonuses actually reflect performance – so if you over-perform, you get significantly more money.
- Lots of trainings.
- Excellent treatment in the rare cases where termination occurs: you're paid for searching a new position for several months.
- Leaders are chosen with strong regard to their leadership &amp; people skills. Most employees respect and speak well about their leaders' actions, regardless of how far above the leader is. This is an extraordinarily rare and good sign.

Focus on creating value includes:
- You do not have many "gate-keepers" –&nbsp;those people who want to be in things because "it's in their area". People only mix themselves in things where they can contribute, and stay out of the way otherwise.
- Projects are ambitious; they set out to address big problems in the HealthCare industry. For example, one of the current ambitions is "twice the access to medicines for half the cost to society".
- Roadmaps are courageous: several projects are radical, with timelines of 8+ years. I was positively surprised a few times by the willingness of leadership to take sharp decisions with short-term impact on revenue because they were "the right thing" going forward.
- Challenging: most leverage the boundaries of state of the art research on chemistry, hardware and software.

All in all, the average employee base is extremely competent, quality-driven, and willing to fight for "what's right".

Additionally, there is a lot of mobility within the company. Many people move around every 2-3 years, and people who strongly over-perform are often promoted quickly, or at least pushed up in salary very quickly.

This is hands-down the best company I ever worked for. Great, engaged people who care to do right by patients and society. I have been 3 years at Roche.

Cons: With it growing very quickly the support functions are massively over stretched and thus very little support given for employees.
Advice: Put your employees first and they will put your company priorities first. The risk is not looking to change the management team - huge shake up needed so that nepatism is quashed.
Pros: Good pipeline and fellow employees are striving for success but feel time for a senior management shake up as company has grown too fast and too quick and thus too many processes and procedures rather than chances to flex your autonomy.

Cons: The organization is large and complex so it's sometimes hard to know the SOPs and where to get the correct information from, but there are initiatives underway both locally and globally to change that. Moving to more an agile mindset.
Advice: None
Pros: The Roche Site in Mississauga in general is a great place to work, lots of opportunities to learn and for growth. 
The environment is very inclusive and collaborative.
There is an onsite gym which you will need because the food if the Cafeteria is very good.

Cons: - some initiatives coming from management don't make sense to those "down below"
- some people can be very change-averse
Advice: Please include some representatives of the normal staff when you develop change initiatives, so that the execution of those initiatives does make sense for eveybody and is worth the time and money spent on them.
Pros: - good working atmosphere, colleagues will always take time to help you
- management is approachable and willing to listen to concerns
- the company is almost constantly changing and adapting

Cons: Line Managers do not want the employers to grow because they don’t want to lose balance in their teams, so it’s not that easy to change the job position or to grow with their help. There’s a lack of encouragement to the employers, despite they say that they support career.
Advice: They should listen more and they should help powerful employers to a satisfying development into the company.
Pros: Good benefits and career possibilities. Salaries are not exceeded but they are ok. International environment and policies. Human Resources Department very active.

Cons: We are in the middle of a culture transformation and the culture is still conservative there are pockets of true agile culture but still not enough. Resistance to change and innovation, slow decision making processes, Not enough strong and bold vision. Too much politics and not enough action
Advice: Reinforce the culture change and also let go those leaders that resist and create bad environment in their organizations this has a huge impact on the agile transformation. Stop talking about agile mindset and start Doing Agile
Pros: Flexible working times, career development opportunities and good benefits

Cons: No appreciation at all for your contribution and too much political game playing instead of focusing on working efficiently on tasks ahead and within projects.
Advice: Contractors often make the difference in your projects - don't make their work more difficult - trust them and longstanding employees should be more collaborative than territorial.
Pros: Lots of projects for contract that are interesting and challenging with a highly diversed workforce. Most of the colleagues are really great. If you do your networking well - you might get hired for the next project.

Cons: It is good company        Salary is not bad ,overtime work pay is good . Company culture is great and colleagues are nice if u leave u will miss it
Advice: None
Pros: A good company                                   Salary is not bad ,overtime work pay is good . Company culture is great and colleagues are nice if u leave u will miss it

Cons: Questionable job security due to relocation of positions away from US/EU to cheaper locations. No career growth within the department other than line management (i.e. group head) in the best case. No granularity in job titles based on depth of experience and responsibilities; everyone from beginner to advanced is a "manager".
Advice: N/A
Pros: Good salary &amp; benefits, innovative company with many promising projects, wide product portfolio of impactful products, development opportunities available to (some) employees, travel budget better than in some other large pharma companies, some of the group heads truly care of their direct reports.

Cons: Since 2 years we are going from one transformation to another and this has resulted in layoff after layoffs after layoffs. We started in the affiliates, than we moved to HR, Finance, legal, Communications, than to R&amp;D, than to Diagnostics, than to IT and probably we will start again then. Today we don’t say restructuring or reorganization we call it TRANSFORMATION. There has been 1000s and 1000s of job losses in all these transformations. And nobody speaks about it...........How do they keep it quiet???
Advice: Less transformations and more focusing on really Digital health and let’s save also some money on the extravagant Management salaries (as they keep getting higher and higher)
Pros: Moving more towards self organized organizations, more employee empowerment. Salary, and other benefits on site.

Cons: Honestly, there is for me no cons what about I could tell. Roche is for me one of the best Company to work for. Roche is a great place to work.
Advice: Honestly even here I can give only one advice. Change nothing in that what you do and how you do our business. We anyway looking always forward what we can change to make something better.
Pros: Roche care always very good about thier employees and good chances to make career around the world. Roche is a great place to work.

Cons: Poor compensations, mediocre management decisions (from a country level). Poor or misguided understanding of economic environment in which the company operates. No clear execution of the strategy. Great plans on paper, poor execution in reality (from the affiliate level in Venezuela).
Advice: They have to realize that the Pharma Industry is constantly evolving, subject to payers & stakeholders demand. Some of its preferences may change overtime and would likely pose greater barriers of access to Roche's pipeline of products
Pros: Great portfolio of products. Amazing colleagues and constant support from different affiliates. A keen innovation-driven company mindset.

Cons: Tend to more and more get rid of people quite ruthlessly when they want to reduce headcount,  even when they are above 50 and  highly qualified. Are not really good in decision making, often no mandate across the network, to be enabled.
Advice: Make sure that you don't spoil the trust, that your employees still have in you, your credibility is fading more and more every year.
Pros: Very social attitude (still, but fading in the last years), give everybody the chance to develop apart from his training history, if he is qualified.

Cons: There are no real downsides except the culture shock when moving hear from America where people tend to be more friendly upon first meeting them.
Advice: It would be great to see more women in leadership roles as it does sometimes appear to be somewhat an old boys club.
Pros: Ethical approach.
Meritocratic environment.
Good rewards and recognitiion scheme.
Ability to prgress your career both within the affiliate and globally.

Cons: Compliance and process is very challenging. Bogged down in so much administrative red tape. Makes being creative and innovative difficult. Customers think company has gone too far with compliance. Some infighting of the CDN Executive Team.

Pros: Talented people, development opportunities, work life balance, flexible work arrangements, decent pay and vacation and benefits. Great products and mission to help patients.

Cons: Poor managment.  Technicians are are given all the responsibilities with none of the authority for most situations.  Expected to put company before family.  Employees are asked to provide ways to improve operations, but when they do, thery are chastised and reprimanded for not being a "team player".  In short, the company structure is a "Comedy of Contradictions".
Advice: Let the employees manage themselves.  Trust that the people who are doing the work, know how to do it best (that is why you hired them in the first place, right?).
Pros: Products provide superior staining, making for fast and reliable patient diagnosis.  Produts are considered "top of the line".  Impressive technical apptitude from the support staff.

Cons: High expectations with limited resources, frequent management changes, short term strategic growth is main driver
Advice: Look to long term strategic growth strategies (4-6 year), and change management training program to reflect that as 2-3 years in any one position only reinforces this short term strategy. Aggressively promote women and minorities into senior management to bring different perspectives to the leadership team.

Cons: Flat structure, however internal movement and promotion is still very high.

Pros: Great company culture that really respects the work/life balance. Friendly and collaborative staff who are really passionate about what they do. The new office in Barangaroo, Sydney, is fantastic. Light, modern with a hot-desking environment and a rooftop terrace with full-time baristas serving complementary coffee all day - how many employers do that for their staff? No core working hours and working from home is encouraged. Shows management really respect the Australian culture. Generous transport policy for people flying overseas and lots of international secondment opportunities.

Cons: old-fashioned, swiss-dominated leadership - some might say a "good old boys club"; unclear strategy wrt personalized healthcare; constant small reorganizations - slowly been pulling off the bandaid for years, rather than just yank it off --&gt; causing low morale; code of conduct adherence seems to be optional for some senior leaders...
Advice: Take strategy communication more seriously; be more honest, bold and forthright about reorganizing the company;
Pros: Good and always improving office environment; really competitive pay and benefits; in most places a collegial work environment; corporate with a conscience; I love my team!

Cons: They dont pay extra hours even when you work on saturday, sunday. holidays or after labor hours
Advice: It is a good idea that all the people leaders live the VACC values, breathe the VACC values not olny in a paper.   To take in consideration the years of the collaborators have working in Roche, their experience and knowledge before fired them without a valid reason, such as Transformation D
Pros: The job perks are awesome, and it is rated as a best place to work, you can help people causing a positive impact in their live and health

Cons: Extremly high expectations in terms of flexibility and engagement
The vocational training department has huge expectations and none of the vocational trainers there is authentic or works with passion.
Apprentice's loan is above average and no other expenses are being refunded (school books, language stays etc.)

Pros: Great working athmosphere
Above average loans
Has a very good reputation

Cons: Frequent changes in management.  Must have high adaptability.  Though have clear company values, it can be challenging, not to say difficult, to seriously demonstrate them when you continuously have to start anew with new managers.  Little opportunity for growth.  Too much bureaucracy.
Advice: None
Pros: Great colleagues always willing to help and cooperate.  Hard working and motivated people.  Good and friendly working environment.   Well remunerated.  Good advantage & benefit program.

Cons: Some challenges around decentralization versus centralization but I don't think more than in comparable global companies.
Advice: Use IT as an integrator, don't let every business do want they want.
Pros: Roche is a high-performing and successful yet caring company. It looks after its employees well and, due to the founding family owning the majority of the controlling shares, it has a stable strategy which is not dictated by the next quarter's results. Roche is a community of highly talented and passionate professionals and I feel proud to work here.

Cons: Global working so sometimes hours are long, but that is a fact of most global businesses. However, Roche is flexible with working hours so the impact to personal life is mitigated well.

Pros: The company has a wonderful corporate culture at the Mississauga campus. They encourage employee wellness and promote social activities, and are flexible and accommodating when it comes to work-life balance. The campus is beautifully constructed with lots of natural light, adaptive work stations, a full cafeteria, gym, and casual seating areas.

Cons: Management needed to communicate more efficiently and it was very unfortunate that with the site closure, a lot of employees were dissatisfied with the communications regarding the events leading up to the closure.
Advice: The employees are basically the engine of the company. A little more consideration would have been much appreciated and would've made the transition so much easier.
Pros: Roche Palo Alto had such a beautiful campus. Most importantly, the company had intelligent, hard working, and pleasant employees which made it so easy to come to work everyday.

Cons: Environment. People specially those whose been with the company for  years tend to be close minded and unsupportive. No proper guidelines and policies in place. They keep badmouthing  others and always pointing fingers.
Advice: Be tough enough to change such employees. It's Detrimental to work and Not helpful. It adds stress to others.
Pros: Pro-employee. Good benefits. A lot of activities for employees. Good incentives. Situated in a place where it is good to work. Not that strict. Compliant.

Cons: Lots of changes recently, though for the better, but it requires to much flexibility from employees. Leave some time for stabilization. We need to take a breath.
Advice: Keep doing like this, but be always honest with employees. Always tell us the thruth and keep your word.
Pros: Good employer. Lots of benefits, yearly bonus based on achievements, soft skill trainings, possibilities to travel.  Lots of improvements in the past 3-4 years. 
Good place to work at. Employees are assets. Big focus on people management.

Cons: Company has been slow to transform, processes take up a lot of time, difficult to find new career opportunities within the company if not interested in relocating to Basel. Seems like most countries are still not fully open to permanent remote work.
Advice: Expedite transformation by hiring more digital talent from outside the industry.
Pros: Friendly culture and experienced colleagues, great benefits (incl. health insurance, extra paid leave for all), remote work has been common (in our country) even before pandemic. Meaningful work in healthcare.

Cons: Extremely political environment.  If you were not a major brown noser, you were not advanced.  Only those that either kept their mouths shut or cleaned the bosses office were given opportunities to shine.  Providing outstanding performance was not enough, except to keep your job.
Advice: Get over the FDA requirements and figure out what they require and how to provide it.
Pros: Great pay, benefits and working environment.

Cons: Frequently working with colleagues around the world which is both exciting and interesting, but challenging from a logistical perspective. Many late night or early morning calls with colleagues at other HQ locations.
Advice: Internal transparency and communication are key. I feel Roche does this quite well but in some areas could do better.
Pros: Speaking for the Basel location. Great benefits, flexible work hours, a family-like environment. Very strongly positioned company that will remain a market leader well into the future.

Cons: Boys club at operational / country and Region. Jobs are given based on being part of the club not on merit. The organization is slow to make decisions and poor at prioritization

Cons: Extremely political work environment.
Truth is a negotiable concept.
Upper management are very disconnected from the realities of the business.
R&amp;D has had very limited success in Europe (luckily Genentech &amp; Chugai are effective).

Avoid the bureaucratic creep of box ticking.
Your career advancement should not be your sole focus.
Pros: Substantial resources
Good reputation among physicians
Opportunities for development
Adept at identifying takeover targets

Cons: making a career in Roche is difficult since not talent is the driving force but the number of years working in certain positions
Advice: A lot of people are overqualified for their jobs (e.g. in operations). A lot of resources are wasted on meetings, processes are slow. Company can save a lot of money if they were more efficient and would reward talent and excelent work instead of rewarding being there and just doing your job.
Pros: conditions of employment are fine

Cons: Always changing directions. Can't keep good people. Focus of company changes so often that it is hard to be consistently successful even if you do what is asked of you. Quotas often unattainable.
Advice: Quit giving lip service to caring about employees and show it with actions. Somebody please tell them to set quotas based on the market and not based on a dream.
Pros: Pay was good. Benefits good. There were a lot of opportunities to move within the company if you knew the right people.

Cons: Roche singapore is located in Tuas and is far away from residential and commercial area. Hence there's little access to town areas. There are also a few temporary building in the singapore site.
Advice: Roche singapore should Continue to have an open culture where communication is encouraged. This is help to retain staff and continue a great place to work culture.
Pros: Roche singapore culture at the workplace is very open and communication is encouraged. The medical benefits are fantastic and roche focused on learning and development.

Cons: Always reorganizing.  Not that it is bad, it's just that very few people actually understand how things work from beginning to end.  Lack of training.
Advice: Clarify how departments interact, where the intersect and where the lines are drawn.  Stop spending so much time on staffing head counts and do the right thing.
Pros: Amazing mission.  Very wide variety of personality types.  Interaction with broad base of disciplines, from engineering to medical to business to marketing.

Cons: Incentive structure not attractive enough for the sales reps where there is no motivation to achieve higher than the sales budget. Also, not very savvy in terms of multimedia and digital information
Advice: Continue to improve on the incentive structure and multimedia interaction between customers and company. The company will take off to greater heights
Pros: A lot of training provided and also very friendly atmosphere. Also a very conducive environment that fosters integrity, courage and passion in both the office and the workplace!

Cons: High complexity due to the size of the organization and its global set-up. High tolerance for complex processes and not enough drive for simplicity.
Advice: None
Pros: I like working for Roche as the company has a strong sense of purpose and values integrity.
There's also a strong focus on people and their development. As an employee you get a lot of freedom and support as needed.

Advice: I work in an outsourcing position, most of the time the company make difference between people hired by Roche and Outsourcing employees and it is  demotivating.
Pros: In this company you have the opportunity to work with people from every part of the world. It cares about its employees so it provides services as  gym, transportation and dining

Cons: Management in Argentina... where to start... it’s a boys club.
Don’t attempt to think on your own, just lower your head and say yes to everything, and don’t ever think of exposing their flaws. You will be the outcast and they will look for any excuse to send you off.
It’s a pity that people still think Roche is a good place to work.
It is not. They have a tyranical policy on which you either are in or you’re out.
Advice: Have the Swiss get rid of top management and start taking care of people who actually do instead of just being there making contacts and see how to backstab others.
Pros: Nice wording, messaging and offices

Cons: Can be a very political organisation, and some leaders simply do not walk the talk when it comes to the leadership commitments.
A change in global head can literally change how you are valued.
Multiple organisation changes and a plethora of initiatives seemed to have little impact in terms of simplifying and streamlining.
Advice: None
Pros: Fantastic benefits and financial rewards
Plenty of opportunities to develop or move to new roles
Modern working environment 
Values/Leadership commitments set a high standard

Cons: A lot of meetings, no time for work.
Advice: Please guys, let people do their job. Meetings are important, but the ratio between meetings and job is really not ok.
Pros: They treat you like an asset, not as a resource. Your manager will do a lot to make you feel good at the office. After some time your team becomes your second family. Good salary and support.

Cons: We have too many reorganizations lately
Advice: It would be great if there was a more logical transition and less mixed messages/actions (e.g. global and local management actions and statements should be more in line)
Pros: Roche is a great innovative company where you can make a difference for our patients. It is also very global and diverse, yet you have certain freedom in actions (in non-gxp related activities). Company provides training and development programs as well as some other benefits.

Pros: Job security is good. Business model is sound. Senior management is new, fresh and optimistic. Work life balance is acceptable.

- no genuine interest in taking care of employees 
- no empathy, the H= Hostile instead of Human
- “Broadcaster” (unprofessional)
- the executives are trained as messenger
- bad in receiving constructive feedback

- benefits are not compatible with other sites

If the company cares about employees’ mental health, you may want to check it out.
Pros: Great learning place for junior positions

Cons: - Poor attitude from the leadership team, all talks no action.  Some leaders even play "passing the blame" game. 
- Long serving employees holding managerial position who have no prior experience  in the industry, either bossing around new hires or play the ignorant game resulting in frustration among new hires.  
- Poor internal processes, some departments did not even have one for past decades.
Advice: Please be fair to all employees and practice active listening.
Take appropriate action on feedback instead of pretending to listen.  We know when you are just putting up a show.
Pros: - Colleagues are generally easy to get along
- Remuneration package is better than other industries

Cons: I don't have a bad thing to say.  We've gone through a fair bit of change which can be difficult however we are fully supported with timely communication as to the why and how.
Advice: You are heading in the right direction.
Pros: You are hired for your subject matter expertise, held accountable for your own development and empowered to do things differently.  I'm given the flexibility to balance my work with my family life.  The people I work with inspire me.

Cons: Many employees and so promotion may not be as fast as it is in smaller Companies.
A bit late in lunching some vital money spinning products in the market. for example in launching POC in viral load.
Advice: To be proactive in introducing new technology into the market, as was done for Reflotron. Roche was the first to introduce Electrochemilluminisence  technology into the market.
Pros: World leader in Diagnostics. Diversity in Product lines. A place to work and gain lots of experience. Also a Pharma and Diabetes Company.

Cons: Cold working environment, and I don't mean the air conditioning. Although the office is open-plan you seem quite anonymous. As a contractor you are not invited to many meetings which does not help with getting involved or integrated.
Advice: Don't hire people with a PhD to do work someone with a Bachelors degree can do. They will get bored.
Pros: Nice building, facilities like gym or massage chair included. Able to take a break if needed. Generally possible to work from home.

Cons: It's not a sexy start up... ;-) It's a large company so sometimes you are doing things that are decided from "above", but sometimes the "above" is very helpfull to have as well!
Advice: None
Pros: Like working at a family company, eventhough it's huge. Work together towards a better future in healthcare. Work with sincere and smart people. Be challenged, enjoy together,  improve together, fight together. Doing now what patients need next - as a team and individually. Sense of belonging. Importance and change.

Cons: It's hard to get hired in another position in different location even though you had a favorable experience in your home country.
Advice: If you already have a positive experience in the company as an ex worker, it should be considered more when applying in a different country.
Pros: Great workplace environment, team oriented, excellent benefits and at the same time a caring company, who's quality  products are dedicated to developing cures for so many different conditions

Cons: Like in any other big company I guess: evolution is connection more than merit or competence unfortunately. This is a little bit disappointing.

Pros: Good salary, very nice atmosphere. New building and in house cafeteria.
Work-private life balance is great. Flexibility and working from home is possible.

Pros: Excellent Barangaroo location, modern offices, flexibility, great pay and benefits, career opportunities are endless and great brand new HR team! Excellent vision and purpose making a difference to patients lives.

Cons: If your manager is weak, not much you can do to progress. HR is relatively passive in the Basel site if anything does come up that could be solved by the right level of intervention.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company. The benefit is above the market. The core culture is Roche is amazing but getting harder and harder to find. Most people are very smart and dedicated that makes it a pleasure to go work. I will recommend anyone to give it a try!

Cons: Knowledge culture and self improvement are not important for many. Visible lack of passion, 'just a job' attitude. Career development limited in some departments.
Advice: Focus on people development, on their interests and passion. Employee passionate about his job will perform way better than, worker with 'it's just a job' attitude that just wait to clock out.
Pros: Overall I would say it is good place to work. There are very interesting people, very good atmosphere. Good salary and overall compensation.

Cons: limited agility; low commercial competitiveness; balance quality and speed in delivering products and services; assess which activities are better served by decentralisation and which should be centralised and implement accordingly

Pros: Great company culture; collaborative environment; brilliant brains pushing science to provide treatment and cure to patients in need

Cons: Office politics sometimes gets in the way of recognition of true contributions.  In terms of personal development, one must be accountable to pursue opportunities even it means dealing with difficult managers.
Advice: Encourage and support your employee's personal and professional development.  Fulfilled employees will be greatly engaged and motivated as result.
Pros: Speaking for North American division, great benefits and development opportunities. One's colleagues are among the best in the industry.  Therefore, to get ahead networking is a must.

Cons: Management turnover at the top changes things on average every 3-4 years, sometimes sooner.
Current management believes department disciplines are pretty much the same in sales cycles.
Products sometimes are out too soon (hardware) and customers are forced to help improve them.
Strategic assays are sometimes late to market and competitors establish beachead markets quicker.
Advice: Listen to the field more, customers especially at all levels of bed size.
Pros: Salary and compensation very good.
Teams are allowed much autonomy.
Best practices are encouraged and sought out.
Product support is usually very good.

Cons: - Multi national governance needs work

- Innovative Breakthrough Medicine.
- Treat employees well with above average benefits in all aspects.

Cons: - change sometimes only use buzzwords without addressing the goal of transformation or substantially change for the better

Advice: - motivate the committed, inspired and entrepreneurial employees, reduce further the middle management buffers  to increase agility
Pros: - Opportunities to evolve in different functions and to work globally as well as a learning support
- In general a open culture to share learning and to support each other

Cons: The Company's management is still divided by silos (even at Corporate level)   We are far from synergize efforts and best practices among business units.
Advice: Enhance your real interest in people.  Instill business acumen as a key competency for every Roche employee.
Pros: It is an excellent company that really cares for its employees.  Work life balance is a fact.  Work environment is highly appreciated.   Challenge is a constant.  Highly prepared and competitive people on board.

Cons: In healthcare the product and development life cycles are very long.
As a large company and market leader in many fields it faces naturally the innovators dilemma.
Advice: Focus on what is important and generates value. Look for challenges and solutions inside and outside the company.
Pros: The company is innovative.
The company is a worldwide leader and sells in almost all markets in the world.
The company is very scientific and develops the most modern technologies in the world. 
The company is dynamic and people focused.

Cons: Awkward integration with genentech, adding to already bureaucratic structure & way of working - this makes a short 6 month internship difficult and visibility of a more strategic goal is confusing, many mixed messaged come through and this poses a challenge for realising results.
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, usually a positive environment - good support and a great team, encouraging participation and giving autonomy and responsibility: I felt I made contributions which were worthwhile and useful & this was appreciated

Cons: (This is about Roche Diagnostics in Penzberg Germany, I don't experience within Pharma but I heard it is much better) The environment is not international although they claimed to be an international company. People are not incentivized to be creative and make processes faster and more efficient, but just to follow the status quo, no matter how old or outdated they are.
Advice: None
Pros: Relatively good payment and benefits

Cons: departments are disconnected from each other
Each department is possessive of "their" space, and their work is more important.
There is also a lack of communication between department directors down to the working scientists and technicians.
directors will design an expansion space without consulting the techs who will be working there.
Advice: 
Pros: satisfaction of bringing a new product to market
getting recognized for contributions to the company,
It is a good community of scientists and support personnel

Cons: More and more overseas employees taken the management positions. They don't understand the local market but not listen to local staff. They are very short term, only want to get all the benefits from Hong Kong, gain Asia experience and then be promoted to other big countries.
Advice: Please be humble and listen to employees. Respect people in all levels.
Pros: Very resourceful, good colleagues and products

Cons: Old school managers unwilling to change, Bad HR,  online systems that are bodged

It used to be a brilliant place to work where people thrived but has been dragged down.
Pros: Working hours , international travel, products

Cons: - Continuous restructuring/ new ways of working, which stifles short term / day to day progress

Advice: Clear out a lot of the middle management holding the organisation back.
Pros: Lots of opportunities, good facilities, lots of people and access to expertise.

Cons: Quite a number of senior HR Leaders are ineffective, and anything but inclusive, some very aggressive female leaders from UK & US dominating their field

Pros: Pay & Benefits, 90 nationalities working in Basel at Global HQ, most co-workers are friendly

Cons: Strong boys club culture, too much micro management, middle management prevents change, job promotion only if you are a follower, constructive criticism is not welcome

Pros: Good company, great values, awesome people, flexible working time, benefits, training, promising product pipeline

Cons: Less open to new methodologies and ideas. Slow on execution. Very difficult to scale a process from a local site globally.
Advice: Invest in listening to the young talent entering the company. People coming with new ideas and visions might shape the future of how the company innovates.
Pros: Very structured and professional environment. Managers and employees are extremely educated and experienced.  I learned a lot from my co-workers from around the globe.

Cons: With flexitime comes the attitude of you work until the job is done. You'll get compensated for this, but some weeks can be manic
Advice: Keep up the work!

Pros: Nice environment (when stable), good learning organization, diverse, opportunities to grow and develop career

Cons: Roche made me realize that absolutely EVERYTHING in Roche  depends on the chemistry and the daily mood of the day with your manager. It did not turn out very well with sick leaves,  disagreements and ultimately leave of the company.
Advice: Please evaluate managers from a character and clinical perspective as well and not only from a pure professional perspective.
Pros: Roche HQ in Basel is the most elegant and well-equipped offices I ever seen. Everything is of the highest quality; the restaurants, the meeting rooms etc.  The salary benefits are great!

Cons: Consistently looking to improve/reorganise gets fatiguing
Advice: Wanting to improve and get better is great but it is hard to know where we are and where we want to go if we are changing all of the time
Pros: Work life balance is great! You are at the cutting edge of Pharma research and development. They really look after you and you feel that you are part of a strong and supportive community

Cons: Culture is different within each business unit. Promotions are made based on relationships not merit. Group managers are the watchdogs for the directors and don't know the business. Managers are the work dogs and know the business but get no credit.  HR is only in place to make the company look good and keep the leaders, directors out of jail....useless for employees.
Advice: None

Great benefits, compensation and adaptive work environment.

I love working at my dream job!

Cons: Typical MNC requires plenty of showmanship and act according to perceptions of others.

Pros: Remuneration &amp; benefits are relatively better, e.g., base pay, incentive, birthday bonus, insurance coverage &amp; etc.

Cons: relatively low salaries, too much attention to the corpo culture, very low chance to grow

Pros: good for start your career when you are fresh right after your Bachelor

Cons: Promotions are not always given based on capacity or performance, but based in the connections a person may have with upper management

Pros: Roche is a company with global presence. A person with the right connections and attributes may be able to grow and get jobs with more responsibilities

Cons: External candidates are favoured more over the existing internal talent pool. Many lay offs.

Pros: Flexible hours; Roche days (extra vacation day almost every long weekend); subsidized cafeteria; on site gym; friendly people; renovated office; great products

Cons: Very much process oriented unnecessarily , does not adjust with even a slight breach , even will make you sign regarding your posting and mode of conveyance if you want to work.overall for me the company sucks.

Cons: sometimes a bit conservative, not much standardization among departments which can be confusing
Advice: It's worth to preserve the open atmosphere and the culture even when it means short term loss of productivity in some pockets.
Pros: Roche takes care of its employees, salaries are good as well as the working atmosphere among colleagues, innovation-friendly, one can bring in his own ideas, social activities like Roche Sport Club

Cons: Way too many processes and complexity created due to heirarchy and need for everyone to feel consulted, as a result, everyone is 'busy' trying to keep people happy while projects move in a glacial pace
Advice: Simplification of projects is needed, true prioritisation, meeting culture needs to be addressed, people who excel need to be rewarded, not just the people who know how to please others
Pros: Autonomy, people development, interesting work

Cons: Too much of internal marketing and showbiz by each employee; not ideal for silent genuine workers who are media shy and believe in work speaking for himself; Introspection required - Are they genuinely celebrate diversity

Rather than just social media presence, actual work with cutomer's need to be emphasized

Advice: Roche could stand to add a little more fun into the workplace
Pros: Smart people, high level of integrity and a strong pipeline.  People who come to Roche usually don't leave for other companies.

Pros: Collaborative culture. Great Benefits and attention to the employee as a person. Integrity in the business. Great care that everyone is informed at all time on what's going on (even with some slip-ups)

Cons: I was on-boarded by a person who was on a years contract, and I had no idea I would be taking some of her jobs. Result was no knowledge sharing, no help and any emails I sent requesting help went unanswered.
My job is quite deadlined so I relied on timely responses from others, but nearly every email or request for help fell into a dead hole. This is the culture here. No 'out of office', no idea where the person is you are trying to contact. Are they on holiday or just ignoring you? The answer can be found with a trip down to the 'Street'  here people will spend all day having 'meetings' - conveniently near to the coffee bar.  Does anyone ever work in his place?
People: REPLY to emails!!  RESPOND. Stop talking - it is not an efficient use of your time.
Advice: People who are on contracts will be safe guarding their own jobs, so they should not be put in charge of contactors or new starters.
Take a look at peoples diaries, they will be blocked out all day with meetings, so when are they actually going to do the work?? You know - sitting at the desk, head down.  I think head office in Basel should shake this lot up.
Pros: The restaurant and the gym, the security people, IT guys and the receptionists are always nice, helpful and friendly.

Advice: Improve efficiency rather than hiring bunches of people and make the structure even bigger
Pros: Excellent company for it's reputation in both pharma and dia industry,  the company cares about people and respect a diversified culture

Cons: Sant Cugat Digital Hub (just talking about my experience there) :
This site does not take care of employees. It is not the mission of the Site to keep people / Talent. That explains the high grade of people rotation. Every month people are leaving and new ones are coming. 

There is a big lack of structure, this makes difficult to work for the department and to understand what they expect from you.

Flexibility concept of this site have a total different meaning here many times. It means that you need to be flexible for working at 18.00, 19.00, 20.00, 22.00, etc. They sell it as something good but it is not the case because of that reason. 

 Even though they say the opposite and they really believe it, there is still the culture of, if your boss is in the office you must stay in the office till he leaves. The Digital Hub and Diabetes in general works like a big Silo. This means that if you are expecting to be able to make a career from here forget about it. Maybe Roche Diagnostics (in San Cugat as well) it is different and it is worth to try.
 
If you want to live in Barcelona, then it will take at least 1hour by public transport to reach the site. It does not matter where you live in the city. At the end of the day it always take 1 hour (forget about the car because of traffic jams).

Instability due to lays off planned in US and Germany (Roche Diabetes)
Advice: You have to change everything or if not you will lose the site. Basel gave you a great opportunity, you should not throw it away. Learn how to treat people, try to bring Roche Culture to the Site -  which I am pretty sure has many good values. Try to keep the knowledge in house instead of just hiring externals. If you dont want that people learn while working  they will leave.
Pros: I dont see any apart from colleagues. They are really nice and willing to help at any time.  All in all and from my experience, I would just advise not to work in the site (not in Roche as a company but just in this location)

Cons: As a growing site, there are still processes that needs to be develop to deliver exceptional value to our business and our patients.
Advice: Continue to listen and engage with us.
Pros: Senior leaders who listen, engage and grow the site by cultivating different platforms for growth opportunities. Helpful colleagues both within the site as well as across the globe who are always willing to lend a hand when needed.

Cons: Company culture, Restructuring in every 2-3 years as Company works on very short term strategy of 2-3 years (If that way of working can even be termed as strategy), No long term vision, Many Instances of Senior management being fired &amp; asked to leave immediately. Continuous Degrowth in business in last 5-6 years, Lack of intent, focus &amp; seriousness by Management to grow business which impacts people at lower level during restructuring. Not a company to work if you are hired at junior &amp; mid level management.

Cons: In Sant Cugat Software Development area the intermediate management layers kill everything good about corporate values because they only want to protect their seats and fat salaries. Young people, apprentices,  without experience are pulled in to cover new positions and get sucked into the corrupted culture that sustains 10+ years of the senior managers.

They are destroying the values built during 13 years. I hated to go to work this year, as everything  is so false now.
Advice: Be honest!  People are fed up your  lies, communicating false results and no transparency at all, despite the communication. Lies will not engage anyone.
Pros: The Company Roche, in general os ok.

Advice: Make Roche Tesla of healthcare (i.e. make sure ~40% of your staff are engineers).
Pros: A very R&amp;D oriented company. Great working environment and company culture. And at the end of the day you save people lives there, not sell candies.

Pros: Growing organization with strong management team that empowers and provides opportunities to team members across the site

Cons: Bad work culture and staff mental health ignored
Advice: I have tried in the past year to resolve this through legal recourse with no positive result.

Entity I'm refering to is not Dia or Pharma.

The incidents mentioned herein has caused me tremendous stress and trauma. 

It's very bad for staff mental health.

Diplomacy to resolve issues whilst Im employed yields no positive outcome. 

As per some comments on glassdoor herein, diligence, clear understanding of work process and SOP are not really appreciated.

It's whom we play up to that matters.

In this particular entity, an admin asst who only came onboard on April '19 can play all kinds of politics with EA whom she report to.

It's totally bizzare why management felt such behaviour is acceptable.

The creme de la creme is 17th July '19.

What admin asst did on this day?

Attachments from my lawyer to whom it's being send, should know.

All I want to say here is 3 colleagues advised her that not possible to issue cheque by 4pm that day as vendor is not in SAP.

It's not her JD and it's wrong procurement process.

She has been clearly advised to approached me as it's my JD. 

The worst these colleagues are attending training on that day.

She just stubbornly refused and later that day lash  out at me over a trivial incident.

It's clearly verbal abuse and an assault on my character.

At meeting to resolve issues, Head of APAC Finance, HRBP, EA who is also LM to admin, totally brushed all facts aside.

Her excuses are all accepted.

Did they question her on her stubborness not to understand work process over insistence to issue cheque. No.

Did they reprimand her over verbal abuse and to apologised to me as what I requested. No. 

Instead I witness a charade of my LM (Head of Finance APAC) asking HRBP to look into our jobscope.

Honest, if my LM n HRBP have  no clarity of our jobscope then this is really bad management. 

I have assured before admin asst came onboard there is no overlap of job scope.

Moreover email from EA on admin asst onboarding clearly states her job scope - again no overlap.

The only thing I understand is HODs' whom I support at that time will be transfered to admin asst portfolio.

Site security, procurement etc is clearly not admin asst's JD.

All I want is an apology from admin asst which is clearly something management don't feel Im being owed an apology.

Do you blame me for politely ending such unproductive meeting and walking out?

Yet, HRBP n LM kept insisting matter resolved.

There are many incidents which I have clearly highlighted which are bad work ethics and practise.

Well questions to Basel HQ,.

Is it correct that new staff be encouraged to ignore correct work process?

Is it correct that new staff be indirectly encouraged to be disrespecful to fellow colleague  and lash out as n when they feel they are entitled to.

N refused to apologised under weak excuse which management accept.

Is it correct that management encouraged bad work ethics?

I have witnessed many bad altitudes here in this office.

The above is not an isolated incident and I have diplomatically brought this up to my LM.

EA whom Admin asst is reporting to has always been politics stirring.

She has on many occassion even sent me an invite when she take leave cc to our then IT manager n admin asst.

Note - I do not report to IT manager or EA.

Really?. If this is not creating an unhealthy work environment? 

This is not staff mental health being stressed to the max?

All kept quiet and accept EA's bossy ways as management have indirectly encouraged such bad behaviour.

Honest EA accessing an admin asst's KPI as LM. 
The way I look at the situation, it's encouraging unhealthy work environment n politics.

HRPB is no better, my Payasia account was deleted but no apology or explanation given.

Im told my job is redundant however I realised this is not true after I left.

No job should be declared redudant when almost 90% n more of jobscope, is shuffled amongst staff who should not be taking over administrative, local procurement etc.

All I want is an apology from admin asst and to highlight all the bad management practise.

All I want to say in summary - To do the right thing as management

Roche is overrall a reputable Company. 

It's just that this entity don't seem to embrace the correct Roche culture
Pros: All sorts of GOES survey n feedback channel which is not effective

Cons: Roche UK and Ireland is a company that speaks about their values of honesty and integrity without actually exhibiting them at all. I found them to be dishonest and in no way care about the patients we provide services toward.
The company is only focused on maximizing profit at all cost.
They advertise salaries as being market leading, but they pay between 80 - 120 % of the median market salary.
I was one of the most experienced consultants on the team when I left and after 7 years of year on year pay increases I was on scale at 81%. It turns out I was payed significantly lower than everyone else on the team.When taking the job after a restructuring I was told that, based on our experience, we would all be on the same salary scale and bonus structures. However after speaking with some of my team mates I found out that this was not the case. When I raised the issue, I was repeatedly lied to about my salary in relation to the team until I showed them the payslips two of my colleagues shared with me.
Their HR policies only catered for their UK based staff and even at that the focus was primarily geared towards their office based employees. The driver training the provided only catered for UK roads and they provided none for the ROI. Another example was they mandated Hep B immunity level to be retested every 5 years, but in Ireland (and the majority of the world) guidance was updated to say once achieved immunity is life long. As a result it's not possible to get retested 9nce immunity is proven. I said this to management/HR and that my GP would not test me. Their response was to find another GP and lie about my medical history to get the test done. 
I joined the D&amp;I team in order to help correct these issues and was advised by senior management (including a director of Ireland) to stop doing so.
Career progression is primarily based on you're liked by senior management and not on your ability to perform at your role or your skillet. Also you are significantly hampered if you have a field based role.
The work-life balance was also very poor with regular long hours expected, in particular around responding to tenders.
Advice: Practice the values you preach. Be more honest. Have more integrity. Put the customer ahead of the drive to maximize profits, you can still make a profit while delivering a good service for patients. Start promoting people into management roles who are capable of managing people.
Pros: If you are based on the office, they have an on-site gym and subsidized canteen

Cons: Can be difficult to get things completed due to such a large company things can move very slowly
Offshoring jobs to China

Good culture
Modern benefits such as paternity leave, parental leave
Subsidised cafe
International opportunities 
Onsite gym

Pros: Good salary and benefit, people are friendly and helpful, good environment to work, good promotion, vocation time is plenty. I like it.

Cons: Low diversity in most departments. Nearly all of them have a Natural Science background.

Great work-life balance, flexible working arrangements

Cons: compensation is lower than on market, archair development path (only 3 choices), letting go / firing process at the office in Roche Polska is tremendously bad-humiliating, inhumane. Worth the case for Labour Justice department to see it through. Sadly.
