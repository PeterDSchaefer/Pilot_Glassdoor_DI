Cons: Pay not as competitive. Can be better
Advice: None
Pros: Great work life balance
Good comp off
Great leadership team

Cons: Brand on Your Resume:  After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career:  Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there.  Double that for vendors.  It is VERY hard to "stand out" and move up in the company.  Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too.  Not familiar with the stack rank?  Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called "Microsoft's Lost Decade".
Advice: I'll type it here - but I don't they are listening...
1.  Help proven talent move laterally in the company for new opportunities.
2.  Kill/evolve the stack rank.  Here's basically how it's viewed:.  30% of the company gets 1s and 2s - and they are happy.  50% get 3s and that basically feels like getting a "C" in school.  This sucks for talented people when a multitude of UNCONTROLLABLE conditions keep you from getting into 1 or 2 range.  The 20% getting anything below a 3 are walking dead.  In summary, 70% of the company walk away from the review cycle feeling like crap.  This is no good.

After 10 years, I'm leaving - it's just a matter of time until I find the right opportunity.  I need to find a company spends 90% of it's time building technology experiences, as opposed to 90% of its time building PowerPoints.  And I expect to refuse the exit interview - because if you really cared what I thought, you wouldn't ask me after I decided to leave.
Pros: 1.  If you love tech, this is a great place.  No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.

2.  What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations.  If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher.  401k match is nice.

3.  Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine.  This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs.  The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either.  You'll get a bonus each year and some stock.  It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.

Cons: Because top pay and frequent failure go hand in hand, the orgs are political. Many directors, general managers and some of the VPs are more motivated to protect their status and compensation instead of trying to improve the organization. And so the hardware groups fail and lose money. 

The worst is the politics that arise due to leaders protecting themselves. And folks deep down know they are less deserving of accolades and higher pay and bonuses than their peers in other industries. So while they post how amazing hogging out space for a motherboard on an aluminum brick is, they avoid mirrors that will reveal the truth. They are locusts.

And finally, internally it was admitted that the company wants to get rid of all white men over 45. As a hiring manager
I took a class in which the instructor stated that. And recruiters also told me that they were not allowed to present resumes to me of anyone over 50.
Advice: Drop pay and benefits to what other engineers and managers make in other industries making physical products. 
And get rid of every director and VP and start over.  
Pros: For mechanical and electrical engineers, pay is 2x to 3X what any non tech company pays. And an engineer is less accountable because the hardware teams expect to fail. 
Benefits are premium. Best 401k match on the planet. Health benefit of $3,000 to spend on bikes, hiking and fitness gear etc. Beer kegs exist in most project rooms. And there’s no need to advance your skills beyond what you learned in college. They run their hardware orgs like college design projects not like commercial product development companies.

Cons: You know how Microsoft is supposed to be the chill big tech company with a great work life balance? That might be true in some sections of the company, but my team and the org around us was not that. At one point we hired someone from AWS to the team, and after a few months she left to return to her old job because the work life balance was so much better. Our WLB score on the employee survey was 20/100, whereas the average across all of Microsoft was 75/100. Microsoft pay isn't enough to put up with the BS we had to deal with.

I used to think that they cared a good deal about diversity and inclusion, until they laid off their entire DEI team
Advice: honestly, not much lower level management can do because the org is so political. If you step out of line, you get managed out by the leadership team.
Pros: I loved all the benefits provided by Microsoft. It was honestly hard to keep track of everything to ensure that I got the value out of it all, but that's a good problem to have

Cons: Slow, process heavy, too many layers of management.
Advice: After a decade of culture turnaround Microsoft has started to slip. Culture is taking more of a backseat to profit at (almost) all costs (see recent moves away from climate promises and DEI) Maintaining margins and returning value to shareholders have become leading indicators instead of lagging indicators and the output of great culture. Layoffs have impacted those who have been let go as well as pretty much everone else in terms of morale. I suspect all this is very much by design but my advice would be stop it. Get back to focusing on culture and mission. The damage, however,  is already done and slow decline is a potential outcome. Microsoft will continue to be a great place to work but not quite as great as it was. The risk is that if a decline does kick in, management will double down on the non-cultural aspects, which will accelerate the decline. See Boeing as a cautionary tale. 
Pros: Great benefits, great mission, great people, great campuses.

Cons: - New layoff season makes no position feel secure
- Although the company says they champion work-life balance, it is still commonplace to work into the evenings/weekends to make deadlines
- Poor management trickles down and negatively impacts everyday experiences
- Wishy-washy decision making on an SLT level often makes product direction unclear (too much emphasis on following other tech companies, always feels like we're behind)
- Company is far too heavily invested in AI today and letting other experiences fall by the wayside
- Annoying mandatory, bi-annual, self-reflective Connects that add unnecessary pressure (often during already-busy season)
Advice: • The company should be more concerned about what is best for users rather than chasing trends in AI and finding more opportunities for additional revenue, adding to an even more bloated experience
• The company's overconfidence in AI is cheapening experiences across the board rather than helping make them better
• Connects should be measured by employee contributions and merits rather than an essay on why business goals were or weren't achieved.
Pros: + Flexible hybrid/remote
+ Competitive salary
+ Deferred time off (DTO) (some may prefer PTO)

Cons: Zero job security or advancement:

Reviews only happen twice a year. I worked there for 2.5 years with "no budget for raises or promotions". One or two people in the entire org got promoted once a year. After my first year, there was an internal hiring freeze that kept anyone from even changing teams.

Shortly after my fourth glowing performance review, I was part of the 10k people laid off in spring 2023. Though the announcement was made in January, the layoffs were rolling for months. I was a part of the very last ones, laid off in a group of 12 people by my 5th level skip, to make room for more people to work on their terrible AI. 

Disorganized chaos:

Agile/scrum is industry standard but it still hasn't caught on at Microsoft. If you need structure, clear requirements, etc., make sure that's something the team you're going to join cares about. My org only started doing *quarterly* planning for engineering in late 2022.

I'm back as a contractor now in a different org and it's actually even worse. They don't even do quarterly planning.

Every organization and team have different cultures around planning, expectations, documentation, etc. If you're thinking about joining make sure to talk to your individual manager about it.
Advice: There's a reason Agile is the industry standard for engineering. 

Also, your AI copilot is terrible and I can't figure out how to turn it off. It's possible you can't once your org opts into it. 
Pros: Engaging and motivating work. My family and friends loved telling people I worked there. The pay and benefits are amazing as well. Theoretically there's a lot of room to grow and change teams. It looks good on my resume now.

Cons: After Microsoft acquired the company I previously worked for, the organizational changes rolled through in waves, causing a sense of instability for employees. (This was not unfounded as evidenced by multiple rounds of layoffs). 

Movement to a new position or role within the company is difficult without knowing someone who can facilitate the transition.
Advice: None
Pros: Terrific benefits with unlimited "discretionary time off," wellness perks, and much more. Many learning opportunities to grow within your role. There are also a lot of ways to connect with your team, and there is never a shortage of work - you will never be bored!

Cons: Never report misconduct or inappropriate behavior by managers to HR. Their primary role is to protect the company. During job eliminations, severance packages are designed to ensure your silence.
Advice: Prioritize Ethics: Emphasize the importance of ethical leadership and hold all managers accountable to the same standards of conduct.

Support Employees: Ensure HR practices are genuinely supportive of employees' well-being, rather than solely protecting the company's interests.
Pros: Great benefits, and overall, team members are fantastic to work with.

Cons: The size and complexity of the organization can sometimes lead to bureaucratic processes and slower decision-making. Navigating through various departments can be challenging.
Advice: Simplify internal processes to enhance efficiency and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy. Encourage cross-departmental collaboration to streamline workflows and improve communication.
Pros: Microsoft offers a dynamic and innovative work environment with access to cutting-edge technology and resources. The company culture promotes continuous learning and professional growth.
Employees enjoy excellent benefits, including comprehensive health plans, generous vacation time, and opportunities for remote work. The work-life balance is highly valued and supported.

Cons: High Pressure and Expectations:

Intense workload and high expectations for performance and productivity.
Potential for long working hours, especially during project deadlines.
Corporate Bureaucracy:

Large company structure can lead to bureaucratic processes and slower decision-making.
Potential for feeling like a small cog in a big machine.
Work-Life Balance Challenges:

Despite flexible options, the high demands of the job may impact personal time and work-life balance.
Intense Competition:

Competitive work environment with high achievers can be stressful.
Pressure to continuously perform at a high level to stand out.
Location and Commute:

Depending on the location of the campus, commuting can be time-consuming and stressful.
Cost of living in some areas, like Redmond or Seattle, can be high.
Potential for Burnout:

High-pressure environment and intense workload can lead to burnout if not managed properly.
Need for self-care and stress management to maintain long-term productivity and well-being.
Limited Scope of Work:

Possibility of being confined to specific projects or roles, limiting exposure to a variety of experiences.
Specialization in certain areas may restrict opportunities to explore other interests.
Advice: None
Pros: Competitive Salary and Benefits:

Microsoft offers attractive compensation packages, including competitive salaries, bonuses, stock options, and comprehensive health benefits.
Professional Development:

Opportunities for continuous learning and development through internal training programs, conferences, and courses.
Access to cutting-edge technology and tools.
Innovative Work Environment:

Exposure to the latest advancements in technology and software development.
Opportunity to work on impactful projects that reach a global audience.
Work-Life Balance:

Flexible work hours and remote work options.
On-campus amenities such as fitness centers, cafes, and wellness programs to support a healthy work-life balance.
Diverse and Inclusive Culture:

Commitment to diversity and inclusion with various employee resource groups and initiatives.
Collaborative work environment with a focus on teamwork and innovation.
Career Advancement Opportunities:

Clear career progression paths and opportunities for promotion within the company.
Mentorship programs and access to a large network of professionals.
Comprehensive Support Systems:

Strong support for personal and professional development through mentorship, coaching, and peer collaboration.
Access to various support resources for mental health and well-being.

Cons: Things move slowly here at MSFT just like most big tech companies
Advice: NA
Pros: you work on good things - AI is the buzzword and there is no better place than MSFT to explore and work on AI

Cons: none that I can think of at the moment
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and work-life balance

Cons: On-calls for azure can be tough. 
Stagnant at times - promotions seem longevity based rather than result/contribution based.
Advice: Focus on developing productive team members and reducing overheads.
Pros: Good product. Work life balance. Good community. Better for those looking to stay at their current leveling

Cons: 1. Lack of transparency from leadership
2. Unclear directives
3. Agile and constantly changing work demands, leading to quicker burnout within role.
Advice: None
Pros: 1. Valuable stocks driven by AI demand
2. Remote Work
3. Decent Salary

Cons: Company culture is very structured and a bit old school for a tech company. It can be very inflexible and lead to often wasting time on processes/following up with people.
Advice: Make your culture more friendly for the younger workforce as they are your future. The old guard is holding you back and often scaring off new talent
Pros: Company so very stable and they often hire from within, so it’s very easy to jump within the company. Also people there have a lot of tenure on their roles typically, so you’re working with true experts most of the time

Cons: Inter-group politics hasn't gone away at all
Lot of focus on optics than actual progress
Advice: Focus on delivering good products instead of personal growth all the time
Imbibe the spirit of changes (people, process, product) instead of just optics while still doing the old things
Pros: Potential for decent work life balance
Opportunity to impact lives of substantial population

Cons: I can't think of any cons.
Advice: None
Pros: I loved the team and projects I was involved in. I had good compensation, great benefits and work environment.

Cons: At the time there could be long working hours.
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work, I left in 2005. Driven, smart, dedicated employees that get the job done. Training opps and internal job movement opps.

Cons: no any cons of mlsa are there
Advice: None
Pros: azure cloud service monthly and githubpro

Cons: No salary increases, too much politics to grow, hidden messages and lack of trust. Leadership cant be trusted, they change your metrics at the end of the year.
Advice: Take care of your employees. Stop with the VWYF BS. You are hurting the company and thats why lots of customers are not even renewing unified contracts.
Pros: You have unlimited PTO and you can be layback

Cons: Poorly managed, purely on financials
Advice: Stop managing and start leading the business.  Leaders are only managers, managing to financial numbers
Pros: Smart people, great technologies, leaders in Gen AI

Cons: Leadership lacks vision, skills, empowerment and empathy. Turned into a super toxic place and narcissists are getting promoted and rewarded for maniging out top performers which they don't like. Favoritism is at unseen levels and good 'ole boys clubs wherever you are. I was proud to work for this company but the CEO and Senior Leadership Team ruined the culture. Salary is also pretty weak compared to competitors. Previously, good WLB made up for it but that is completely gone, and so are all the good benefits. Sadly, it turned into a terrible place to work for!
Advice: Get rid of all those toxic managers which are standing in the way of success and ruining other people's live. Stand behind your words. Culture is just a word here to disguise the devils
Pros: Remote work. Other than that nothing else comes to my mind anymore since all the good benefits and pride to work for this company has gone away

Cons: They work you to death... and it is getting more and more common across the company.
Advice: None
Pros: Working with cutting edge technology and with very smart and driven people

Cons: While the pay is competitive, they seem to lag behind a few other companies in the industry
Advice: None
Pros: Great product breadth, industry expertise and leaders in quite a few areas. It also provides great wlb

Cons: You can be laid off at any time, just like at Google. Salaries are not as competitive as they used to be because companies know everyone needs a job now. There are constant reorganizations, and new managers bring new visions and new work requirements. It's important to track all of your kudos because you have to show each new manager why you are valuable. It would be nice if a track record of top reviews was all you needed, but you shouldn't get too attached to what you’re doing.
The last big layoff, Satya and his LT flew to Aspen Great place to learn. Some good hearted people to work with. Some super lazy toxic people who play the political game too
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to learn. Some good hearted people to work with. Some super lazy toxic people who play the political game too. Make sure you work to live not the other way around.

Cons: The work is compelling, but the frequent deadlines and scheduled tasks can make it tough to fully utilize the valuable learning resources available.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft offers a wealth of internal resources that provide excellent learning opportunities. Having worked on multiple teams, I've experienced a high level of collaboration and support. The company's culture fosters innovation and professional development, making it an outstanding place to grow your career.

Cons: Certain managers exhibit a tendency towards meticulous scrutiny. Failing to navigate their expectations adeptly and engage in the necessary political maneuvering may lead to a challenging work environment that inhibits creative freedom.
Advice: None
Pros: You can expect competitive pay, excellent benefits, smart team members and a culture of research-only team meetings that enables continuous improvement and growth. Many colleagues share their work for feedback and present on topics that interest them.

Cons: - Can be "clickish," if you are not a member of the "A Team"
Advice: - Immediately express concerns to your Manager
Pros: - Great Pay
- Ability to work from home

Cons: Politics, unclear asks, poor processes, every changing priorities, lot of bureaucratic, cut throat, sub par upper management, they value term spent with company over quality, every person for themselves, no team culture, it's all for themselves and not for customer
Advice: start thinking of customer and then your team and then for yourself.
Pros: Good brand on resume! Learning opportunities

Cons: The work is interesting, but with constantly scheduled deliverables and deadlines it can be challenging to take advantage of the great resources the company provides. It's important for you to make the time for personal growth.
Advice: Work with the team to make sure people have time to participate in growth experiences.  For a developer a great way to do this is to actively participate in Hackathons.  I think that management could be more supportive and encouraging for people to participate in them, and should schedule them more frequently.  I previously worked at a company that initially reserved one Friday a month for everyone to participate in hackathons, this evolved over time to a full week every few months (3 or 4 times per year).  That allowed time to create significant projects and the company greatly benefited from that.
Pros: Microsoft has so many internal resources with great opportunities for learning. I've worked on various teams and there is a lot of interesting work and contributions are valued. One of the many things the company values is a growth mindset and we regularly look at and discuss our process and take steps to improve them. Each team has the flexibility to do this in the manner that works best for them. We also have lots of great opportunities for cross team collaboration and it's fun to work with other teams and learn about how they do things.

Cons: Every job posting receives 100+ resumes from both internal and external candidates, so external applicants have a high barrier of entry unless they know someone who can make an intro or have such a perfected resume that it gets past HR filters and to the desk of a hiring manager that has at most 10-30 seconds to look at it.

Specific to cybersecurity, Microsoft tends to hire more experienced people and needs to do a better job growing early in career cybersecurity professionals.
Advice: Managers and leadership all the way up the chain need to do a much better job of holding their direct reports, peers, and their own managers accountable when they fail to meet basic ethical standards.
Pros: Excellent internal learning resources and active social communities, support for fully remote work in most cases. You get exposure to vast knowledge bases to help understand advanced technologies and access to people who can explain it so their grandparents would understand. 
I've had very positive relationships with my managers, and even in times of upheaval, our leadership tends to index towards clarity with the general staff.

Cons: Depending on role, the work bandwidth may affect on being able to work on career development
Advice: None
Pros: Great support from mgmt for a career development path, mentorship programs, certifications, etc

Cons: There are some cons but you may think as a opportunity to learn and develop patience
Advice: None
Pros: Best work life balance in fast paced environment

Cons: I worked at Microsoft for 10 years and my entire team was laid off after being relocated to this office after a promotion. This happened due to a corporate restelructure although the my organization I was in was profitable and core to Microsoft. They have lost their culture and focus on security at the expense of AI/proft. They take away your tools to encourage resignations during layoffs rather than pay severance. They do not live their values. Have your resume updated at all times and constantly upskill/find new certifications or you won't last long.
Advice: Change your espoused values. Stop promoting a fake culture. Take care of your people, and change middle management. You should not layoff 10,000 people in order to build a short term moat around AI at the expense of security and long term success. You have ruined many people's careers and mental health for short term profitability.
Pros: Great pay and benefits. Work life balance.

Cons: Large company with lots of products and resources to comb through as you need things. 
Hard to stand out as a team lead or get recognition because of the amount of employees in the groups.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay, professional employees, diversity and inclusion, work life balance

Cons: N/A, pay can always be more competitive but the WLB is more worth it for me.
Advice: None
Pros: Great WLB, competitive compensation, good culture

Cons: Because corporate changed their minds on things seemingly all the time, it was hard to build any kind of trust in them. Plus, when you see your teammates get laid off all the time, you're in a constant state of fear. Plus, because people never really audited our databases, there was a lot of duplicates that an audit would have fixed-- I feel like a lot of people would have never been hired if they had done an audit, and then that would have prevented a lot of layoffs.
Also, I was paid SIGNIFICANTLY lower than my counterparts.
Advice: Think things through before making major changes. And please, audit your information for accuracy. 
Pros: Benefits were amazing. My direct boss was great. On an individual level, it was quite good.

Cons: Too much politics and hard to work with manager sometimes
Advice: None
Pros: Awesome salary and grow to do

Cons: It can be challenging to move around within the company depending on your expertise
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits, coworkers, flexible hours and salary

Cons: Lots of deadlines for several projects at the same time. Often times, we're told we can move deadlines, but many times we're pushed to still get things done.
Advice: None
Pros: I have a great set of managers. They understand that a healthy WLB allows me to work efficiently and not get burned out.

Cons: Too much "bottom-up" methodology. Not enough high level guidance. Management overworked and so a bit inaccessible. Lots of arguably unnecessary bureaucracy. While the desire there, displayed care for employees is questionable.
Advice: Be honest with yourselves about the skillset needed to be a good manager and leader. And be particular about who you promote up to leadership positions as well - a good employee is not always a great manager/leader. Also a great manager isn't always a great leader and vice versa. 
Pros: Salary. Benefits. Varying scale of projects and interesting problems to solve. Desire to care for employees.

Cons: Large, opportunities for young people, can be difficult to navigate.
Advice: Keep it up and focus on people and our impact on the world.
Pros: Innovation, drive, focus on Security, People, technology. Benefits. Ability to influence. Best company I've worked with.

Cons: Corporate processes can be cumbersome
Advice: None
Pros: Career advancement
Dynamic environment
Compensation 
Diversity and Inclusion

Cons: It´s a very intense rythm of work
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, we live the mission of the company every day.

Cons: Don't you guys have anything better to do
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing,wonderful, why you gotta make me do this just to look at some salaries

Cons: Choose Microsoft for it's WLB even they offer less money. If you get hired by Azure or BAP(business application), just run, WLB is a joke in those two departments. For internal transfer, it is the same as external interview.
Advice: None
Pros: Big name as a step stone for first big tech job

Cons: Not enough free time to slap the ham.
Advice: None
Pros: Good food and tasty treats

Cons: The company is quite large, you can feel like leadership isn't paying attention to your organization.
Advice: None
Pros: The benefits package is unmatched, I really enjoyed working with my team.

Cons: Your direct manager, skip level and your team's culture directly affects your experience working at Microsoft. Depending on which department, it could be hit or miss.
Advice: None
Pros: A wide range of products to work on. If you don't just need a job but care about/interested in certain areas of software development, you'll find something at Microsoft.

Cons: Pay is a little low
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and work culture

Cons: cold environment in Seattle winter
Advice: None
Pros: Good work environment good benefits

Cons: Getting promoted is difficult and the company goes through reorganizations and layoffs frequently.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft has great benefits and a lot of opportunities to move to different roles internally.

Cons: I cannot think of anything at the moment.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance and culture.

Cons: Sometimes Microsoft can't commit to fund a project internally, but will turn around and spend 100X to buy a start up that did the same thing a year later. New VPs like to kill the previous VPs initiatives, like a lion taking over a pride killing the cubs, they want to be seen as the source of the vision and leadership, not a babysitter of someone else's idea, even if that idea was brilliant.
Advice: None
Pros: The pay is great, very nice people, almost anything you want to work on in the technical space is available there, so switching around doesn't require switching companies.

Cons: Be aware of which organization you land in if you care a lot about Work Life boundary. E.g the cloud business is doing fantastic yet work load can def be a lot. so i wouldn't say this is a con but really depends on what each individual is looking for.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company that continues to promote trust, customer obsession. Although the company compensation is not at the top but they provide great employee benefits to take care of their employees such as great 401(K) match, fitness/health spend, great healthcare insurance. 

each company has issues that they need to work on so of course Microsoft is not excluded. Yet i think at least they try to recognize the issue they are facing and take action to address even if it can take some time to address or see the outcome.

Cons: None to mention. Maybe more vacation
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to work with good benefits

Cons: Hard to transition roles internally.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay, benefits, and work life balance

Cons: lots of travelling, many new faces
Advice: None
Pros: Nice career options and great care

Cons: *Terrible WLB. Kiss your family-life and hobbies goodbye. Pay atleast 30% less than big Tech peers for many/most roles.
*Early morning and post-dinner calls with Asian countries happen regularly. 
*You could be managed-out or laid off for no reason, because they over-hired in 2021-2022.
*Internal team transfer is tougher than external job switching, strife with discreet nepotism and opacity.
Advice: You're making record profits with the whole AI surge. Please stop managing-out people for fun (and greed), and treating your employees like a cost line-item in a spreadsheet.
Pros: *Senior leadership has been making the right strategic moves in recent years.

Cons: Less Chances to promotion and takes longer time
Advice: None
Pros: Good environment and culture
Good worklife balance
Friendly colleagues

Cons: A lot of opportunists, profiting from the working people, big mouths, visibility experts, and flatter geniuses. MS is a big company and certainly doesn't care for your well being, they cannot afford to care for you, so if you go there, know what you want, take it, give back, and leave when you feel confident enough. Terrible/negative/atrocious HR and management.
Advice: None
Pros: One of the largest technology companies. Learning opportunities.

Cons: Salary can be higher in the industry
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits, culture, work life balance

Cons: We do a 24/7 oncall which is super bad. The system is quite legacy so all you do is sdk/infra migration, security patch, and pray for the change won't break anything otherwise you will get paged at night.
Advice: None
Pros: My manager is a good guy.

Cons: No cons, I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Good place to work, respectufl, benefits

Cons: It can be very pushy sometimes. Working pace is fast. You need to learn how to handle stress here.
Advice: None
Pros: Great working environment with intelligent colleagues collaborating together.

Cons: If you are a transfer from india they take advantage of you and pay very less, Also salary ranges in Canada is too less compared to US
Advice: None
Pros: Pay range in India is good comparatively

Cons: Difficult to move to other jobs within company, large to navigate.
Advice: None
Pros: On the cutting edge, relevant and long-term vision.

Cons: Promotions are extremely hard
They don't really do product. It's all mostly Program. Product is just a title for most areas of MSFT. It's a very traditional org so changes will be slow.
Advice: Don't lay off when you realize you made a mistake in putting the candidate in a role he had said he doesnt have skills for. 
When you layoff, dont take laptop away. Look at what Walmart does to help their displaced people find another role within Walmart. Your "Microsoft provides you help once you are laid off, is merely a lips stick."
Pros: People (very family oriented, very helpful, very humble)
Benefits (though salary / bonus / stocks are lower than other FAANGs)
Mobility within the company

Cons: Stay away from the Data and AI roles if there is a SQL Server component to the job. You are expected to audit (through a cloud economics assessment) 20% of customers per year minimum. 

There are many terrible managers who have no view of their direct reports other than a cog in the wheel. Reviews and level of engagement has more to do with personal relationships and favoritism than actual results.
Advice: None
Pros: If in the right role with the right manager the interactions with customers and Microsoft leaders is great. Benefits are top notch and comparable with all of the big tech companies.

Cons: Quite competitive but overall this is the best place I could ever ask for
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance, compensation, benefits

Cons: Lower compensation than peers; lack of career-path transparency; not innovative.
Advice: Tell the truth. If the company makes a change to make more money, say so. Just an example: everybody knows that the reason for replacing accrued vacation time with discretionary vacation is to remove a liability from the books, not to give employees more flexibility. Be honest.

Clearly state your vision for company culture. Are we moving back to the days of the infamous "guns pointing at each other" poster? I see the louder mouths getting ahead. Is that what it takes? If the answer is yes, fine. One way or another, say it, so employees can make informed decisions about their careers.

Don't be wobbly, stick to the plan and own it. We lost on the internet, search, cell phones, and AR not because of engineering failures, but lack of direction and vision. Today, we are riding on the AI wave, but we get our models from OpenAI and even Meta. We don't make our own chips, unlike NVIDIA and even Google. It is OK if we are the tortoise, who after all wins the race, but again, say so. Don't pretend we are going all out swinging on innovation, when our talent is to perform well on the difficult job of incremental and solid engineering.

Good Managers - Once you are in, you are in, but like with any role finding good hiring managers and teams to work with is critical for growth opportunities.

Advice: 
Pros: Title says it all, wanted to quit for a while but had the golden handcuffs on

Cons: direction can be more defined
Advice: None
Pros: culture and speed is good

Cons: A lot of older guard workers are resistant to improving the engineering process. PMs dominate the show at the cost of SDEs - you will be pushed to deliver buggy releases to angry customers, prioritize features over bug fixes, and then marked down for spending so much time on-call fixing the problems PMs pushed you to ship. There is no extra compensation or time-off for on-call, just pressure. 

Build and deployment processes are slapdash and flaky - expect to wait multiple hours for a build and deployment only for a transient failure to require you to stay late and retry (and expect those failures multiple times per month). Build and deployment process filled with poorly maintained and poorly documented shell scripts. 

Culture of rushed delivery and constant hotfixes, even worse if you're on a service team like Azure. You will not get extra compensation for all of this pressure, and the teams will stay understaffed. 

There are a lot of "bad apples" distributed all over in high positions. Female employees might feel uncomfortable speaking up about their managers leering at their body (as I have), and if spoken up about, little is done for years. Covert racism if you're not white. 

I was in a team under C+AI and we kept losing people and couldn't retain anyone - despite being a crucial and visible part of the ecosystem. Why did people want to leave, and why did people keep getting burned out? We kept losing mostly senior engineers and keeping junior ones, and mostly losing women too. Even if it's not deliberate, you should ask why attrition and poor retention affected those groups the most.
Advice: Actually allow genuinely anonymous feedback where engineers can report concerns without their managers being able to take their words and de-anonymize. Managers frequently berate IC's (individual contributors) for giving negative feedback without speaking up non-anonymously about what to do about it. This makes IC's hide problems instead of reporting them. Multiple times, we had multiple senior SDEs report concerns about maintainability of product launches before they happened, only for our skip-level manager to mention that not a single mention reached them at all - this speaks to the lack of influence individual SDEs have compared to managers and PMs.
Pros: You're around very smart engineers from global teams working together. There are a lot of genuinely hardworking, cooperative, kind engineers that make everyday work so much smoother and easier. Good perks and generally calm atmosphere outside of your team (people are usually nice). Pay is decent, less than other big tech companies obviously, but you get a better work-life balance as a trade. Honestly, you're only here for the pay, the generally ok work-life balance compared to industry, and those good teammates who you will treasure.

Cons: Career progression happens very slowly.
Advice: Always look for opportunities to get senior and junior engineers to collaborate more.
Pros: supportive manager that gives constructive feedback

Cons: no free food. only dringks and coffee available
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Love the growth mindset in the org

Cons: Be prepared for terrible management, inconsistent opportunities, and politics all over. Nothing works the way it could because nobody wants to be the one to say what is broken. Fifedoms are the name of the game, the more heads you lead the less you care to help your teams.
Advice: Being technically efficient has nothing to do with being a manager. Many managers are just politicians and don't actually care about their employees they just want to say they made their employee improve for some made up BS so they coached them and are awesome. Model, Coach, and Care is BS when they burn everyone out.
Pros: Great name recognition, great benefits, and decent pay.

Cons: The leadership team seems disorganized and unclear on strategic direction, leading to constant churn and re-orgs. A lot of people have been there for 20+ years, creating a somewhat old-fashioned culture. Slow to move/not very innovative.

Cons: tons of buracracy, hard to get things done, takes a lot of time to move things.
Advice: None
Pros: OK product, good place to learn and grow

Cons: While the company culture overall is good and they try to emphasize good values, it’s a huge company so you can have a vast difference in experience depending on where you work. If you’re interviewing, make sure you meet with your hiring manager, evaluate them and ask questions about the culture of the team. 
A lot of work is still Seattle centric which makes it difficult to be visible if you’re new and remote, impacting promotions, influence, etc.
If you’re getting hired for a PM position, make sure you understand what is expected from the role. It looks vastly different depending on the product and its needs. I would recommend staying away from products that aren’t growing, especially as a PM.
Advice: None
Pros: As far as big corporations go, Microsoft is one of the best ones to work. The company culture is overall great. They emphasize a growth mindset and try to care about people. They have strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion which helps everyone think about how to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment. The pay and benefits are competitive. Because of all the products they work on, you can work on different products and move teams without leaving the company. They’re also making a lot of great strategic decisions which gives me faith in the leadership and direction they’re headed.

Cons: It can be challenging to balance work load and the circle of impact expectation.
Advice: None
Pros: Great salary, benefits and co-workers.

Cons: boring work
no growth
politics
Advice: None
Pros: work life balance
benefits
good campus

Cons: * Difficult environment for innovation. Microsoft tends to be better at improving existing products than creating new ones. Microsoft puts a lot of effort into innovating, but it often reorganizes, changes directions, or cancels projects before things can pan out.
* Lots of meetings and process that comes with being a large company that has to coordinate between teams.
* Although this isn't generally the case, some "old Microsoft" teams can be very stressful and power struggles between teams and leaders are common.
Advice: None
Pros: * Ability to switch jobs internally within Microsoft to work on all different kinds of projects in all areas of software. Different teams have different cultures and practices, so look for a team that's a good match for you.
* In general, the culture is improving on customer focus and growth mindset. Although management can be political and chaotic, the folks at the ground level generally are supportive of each other and stiving to make the best, most positive products that they can.
* Lots of resources to do things on a large scale and have a big impact.
* Microsoft takes ethics seriously and has a real commitment to doing the right thing.

Cons: Font want to comment on this.

Pros: Very good benefits and decent pay

Cons: Toxic environment, Come out fast as the experienced or less capable will throw you under the bus. I lasted for 5 years and was told to move around every two years, but with all the diversity hires no room for advancement. New positions were focused on diversity hires and MBAs were overlooked. Look at how many U of Phoenix grads as people came to the realization that they pay across the board regardless of role as long as you have the advance degrees and MS would pay for them. They own all my kids hardware now, as I logged in on their PCs during COVID.
Advice: Stop trying to be all things to all people,  Your defense industry business suffers when security fails in the consumer space.  Stop using AI on everything, it's still Machine Learning.  Don't lead by not doing, so all those managers that could not pass certs don't really understand the business. Lead by example, Don't bring back the Steve Ballmer days, had that one thrown in my face by a customer.  I will not work for another company that allows for golden parachutes to be pulled, which happened, it's public knowledge.

Advice: None
Pros: Benefits were great but no stock.

Cons: Horrible work life balance
If you don't get along with your immediate supervisor it will be rough
Some people allowed to contribute very little or strait up refuse work. This means those that do work hard are stuck compensating for those who dont.
Not highest salary, but lots of bonus and stock *Potential*
Having a good relationship with immediate supervisor is critical to your rating, growth opportunities, bonuses, military support etc.
Advice: - Don't promote managers who get poor ratings from their staff. 
- Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. Lots of people want to suggest work but no one wants to own it or do it. 
- Rate people based on the work they do, not on the relationships they have and with whom.
Pros: Medical, Dental, Vision free
Military Benefits (if your supervisor will support you)
Interesting and challenging work
Remote work in some cases.

Cons: Executive business decisions, when they don't yield results, Microsoft does not shy away from reorganizations and likely workforce reductions
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing breadth of technology to work on. Great company culture.

Cons: Lower compensation than competitors. Less developed processes to adapt to changing environments, due to the CE program being fairly new compared to more established programs. This is a constantly improving situation, but it may not be ideal for some folks.

Advice: None
Pros: good wlb, low performance pressure

Cons: salary is not that high
Advice: None
Pros: I enjoy the environment and work

Cons: Work life balance will depend on which team you land on. There is no regulation on on-call responsibilities, therefore some teams have really intense on-call rotations.
Advice: Regulate on-call responsibilities to ensure employees are not working long hours and sacrificing their health by lack of sleeping or not having enough time during the day to log off and exercise or recharge.
Pros: Salary, health benefits, good HR department.

Cons: Like other tech companies, there is a constant fear of getting laid off due to numerous internal reorganizations. Your manager and department will change several times, so if you don't like change, you might not like it here. It can take a mental toll.
Advice: More transparency when it comes to incoming team changes. It's stressful and unnerving that we find out when the changes have already taken place.
Pros: Great benefits, open work culture, interesting work

Cons: Sometimes busy, too much to manage,
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible, freedom, free food and drinks

Cons: Scope is limited.

Advice: None
Pros: great work life balance, good manager, great product

Cons: There was a LOT of intentional deletion/misunderstanding/manipulation of others work product. 

Most of middle management only promotes people who are the same ethnicity as them. 

There was a lot of bullying and racist comments in performance reviews. Racist comments were backed up by Staff. They see no problem with calling Black and Brown people “aggressive” and telling them TO THEIR FACE that they are intellectually inferior. 

Most of the people in this group have ONLY worked in Audit. Their interpersonal skills are limited and they lack creativity to go beyond what’s told to them.

You have to receive a performance review after EVERY 4-week audit. I once took time off due to my dog dying (I took 1 day off) and this was included in my performance review as a “do-better”. 

The group has high turnover (go figure) because upper management talks to people like they’re dirt.

Their “diversity” initiatives are all bull; If you’re not outside friends with upper management you will not be promoted or given the opportunity to travel. 

They will encourage working you like a dog for their 4-week audits that are poorly planned for time/scope, even though upper management is so “skilled” at their jobs they can never budget the right amount of time or resources for an audit.

Most of the group is comprised of “ex-consultants” and this again leads to a negative environment. These people tout lives that would make you think they can extend common decency and some sort of empathy, but you’ll be left talking to empty vessels that are insecure if a thought of yours is someone better than theirs. A very insecure and fake group.

On multiple occasions I saw stakeholders curse at and belittle staff. The thought is that if stakeholders treat you bad that is YOUR PROBLEM and you clearly must have done something wrong. Abuse is encouraged in this group.

I was personally told that my degrees and certificates “don’t matter” by my manager at the time. If that was the case, I’m not sure why they hired me. Statements like this were often made in 1:1s with my “manager” who has been at the company 10+ years, yet never managed people. Make it make sense….. How is one promoted to upper management yet has NEVER managed people. That makes NO SENSE whatsoever. The team does not logically assess if a person is truly fit to lead. 

Theres no training requirement on Project Management so there’s people overseeing this who don’t have the right background. If you bring up Project Management practices they will deflect and state some CPA jargon. This is probably why the genius “4-week” audit idea continually fails and why their scope/budgeting/testing/etc. is always a mess.

Asked to work on weekends (especially for financial audits that are poorly planned) and they don’t pay you for the extra time.

This is currently not a 9-5 job (for the people that aren’t close friends with upper management). This is a 7-8 job and the pay does not reflect that. 

Mentioned above, none of the staff has any background credentials in what they’re doing. Most of the staff has a “CPA” and that’s apparently all you need to understand AI, Project Management, Testing, etc. (*Sarcasm*).
Advice: There needs to be a whole reorg.
Internal Audit clearly has racist employees and refuses to face the problem head on. Many people have quit or sued this group overworked, abused and/or publicly said racist statements about them. 

Telling people that they can’t take a lunch break, pick up their pets/kids after work hours and labeling minority employees as “aggressive” or “unprofessional” when they’ve done nothing to you is pure insanity (at the least). There is a lot of money and time wasted due to  upper management acting like complete maniacs behind doors to unsuspecting hires.
Pros: They appear to be sane when interviewing people for the Audit Manager/IT Audit Manager role.

They continually encourage people to leave the group (“transfer internally”) because they know that the Audit Manager/IT Audit Manager role is a disaster all together.

Again, appearances are all this group has going for them. A lot of smiles and small talk but if you show any sign of being a decent person or a true leader, they will try to mentally destroy you.

Cons: Disorganized, NOBODY!, NOBODY even comes close to quota..the MCS org is a total failure. More expensive, less nimble, total joke.
Advice: LOL, management is a joke, they have no idea of whats  going on. Reviews are a joke as you are railroaded to put in certain construct.  MSFT loves that BS term diversity. Why not just hire good people. So many token hires.
Pros: Money is good. Benefits are good.

Pros: Its a really great place to work

Cons: large company, so development happens very slowly.
Advice: None
Pros: benefits and work life balance are wonderful.

Advice: Give continued support to new hires - not just when they are first onboarded.
Pros: Very kind, caring coworkers. Fun and positive environment. I worked in gaming and every so often I would come across fun projects!

Cons: None that I see here
Advice: None
Pros: Great company to work with

Cons: Compensation is lower than competitors at the same level.
Advice: Increase the stock refresh every year at every level under L68. This is how you can compete with other high tech firms.
Pros: Compared to other tech firms, life is easy in Microsoft. You don't have work long hours(on average 5 hours a day I guess) but can still get promoted if you are good at what you are doing.

Cons: Lower than average salary stock
Advice: None
Pros: Relaxed culture and good people

Cons: - Uncertainty w/ layoffs across the industry
Advice: None
Pros: - Culture
- Pay
- Benefits (Health, Perks, etc)

Cons: Once the tech role (PFE/CE) was combined with the sales role (CSA) it ruined the tech role. As much lip service as is paid to doing what is right for the customer, at the end of the day it all comes down to sales at all costs. I had a hard time reconciling the ethics of a customer paying to have me on site to provide support, but I am actually rated on how much more I can get them to buy. I doubt customers would be happy to know that is how their paid support is rated.
Advice: Split the tech and sales roles back apart. It is near impossible to maintain the trusted advisor relationship when having to also sell more.
Pros: Job was great in the PFE/CE days, extremely rewarding, good compensation, great org.

Cons: No Cons faced until now
Advice: None
Pros: Company with the best career advance

Advice: None
Pros: Culture, work life balance, doing work i enjoy

Cons: Nothing is negative. I like all.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance. Good pay.

Cons: They still struggle with the same issues as all other large companies in that they report to shareholders and are more concerned with the bottom line than their employees.
Advice: None
Pros: MSFT is a large company so everyone's experience really depends on the team you were hired to. My experience is that I had a supportive manager and colleagues that made my journey at Microsoft a great learning experience. The culture really shifted with Satya becoming CEO so a more inclusive and supportive environment.

Cons: New security org rewards vocal know it all types (but don't actually get work done).
Advice: Change security leadership
Pros: Generally collaborative, work life balance exists, smart people, culture supports diversty

Cons: Long working hours hard to mix work life balance
Advice: None
Pros: Very good environment to grow and learn

Cons: Not that many. Big corporation culture.
Advice: None
Pros: Impact, good culture good experience

Cons: Doing more with less post layoffs feels like you are working 3 jobs for 1 income. Turnover rates have increases and losing great coworkers, and promotions are extremely competitive for mid-Level managers and above. Lots of proving yourself and not being seen as a non-Indian Minority. Lots of folk come in under leveled and have to fight toothand nail to climb to have their pay match the skill level they already came in at. Too much overthrowing and too man meeting for the most minor things.
Advice: Give thorough reviews of documentation when promoting and not just the favoritism group thinking circles for promotions. Create a better evaluation scale and judge to that solely and the skills for the next level role.
Pros: Amazing health, selfcare,401k, and family benefits, great people to work with, and amazing Time off policy. Pay is very solid as well. Great place to learn from some really smart people.

Cons: High expectations and driven culture
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of great potential to grow and earn money plus 401K and benefits are top

Cons: Nothing to say, they are really the best in class.
Advice: None
Pros: Out of this world and absolutely stellar.

Cons: Great company to work for
Advice: None
Pros: Work load is too heavy

Cons: No salary increase over last year, lot's of responsibilities with an average salary for the market. Work/life balance is low, periodic 24/7 calls during 2 weeks (bad for employee's health).
Advice: None
Pros: Great perks/benefits, 100% remote work

Cons: Ever so often I hear that some people newer to Microsoft feel that they have to politic in order to move up the way they want to in the company. Personally, I look at the same thing or situation but have a different view. I look it as you needing to be strategic and intentional as far as it relates to your career trajectory and upward mobility within the company.
Advice: Continue the phenomenal job you're doing. Please keep remote work for all employees as we've shown through our data that we can thrive as a company with productivity, efficiency, and revenue with remote work.
Pros: The culture and people at the company are amazing. Incredible leadership, starting with our CEO, Satya Nadella, along with our C-Suite. Microsoft is a very progressive, innovative, forward thinking company. The company's ERGs like Blacks at Microsoft are phenomenal.

Pros: -Great communication
-Feels like a person not a number
-Great pay
-Great benefits
-Great culture 
-Opportunities to travel
-Hybrid work
-Job security

Cons: Training program doesn't really exist. You have to rely on the other members of the team to help train.

Too many vendors/contractors: some could consider this a pro, but Microsoft brings in so many vendors that the Critical Environment team doesn't really do anything complex or in-depth.

Growth: There isn't really a path to move up unless it's into a completely different field or becoming a people manager. There is no true technical lead position like at other data centers.

Culture: This one may seem odd, but Microsoft really got on their employees to donate during their "Give" month. Obviously it's for good causes, but it definitely felt like I was being forced to donate my time/money instead of having it be my own decision.
Advice: I would appreciate more direct communication instead of having to play telephone through my direct manager, specifically having you come directly to the affected employee instead of their manager for simple praise or admonishment.
Pros: Schedule: 4 12-hour days, 3 days off, 3 12-hour days, 4 days off all consecutive

PTO: 80 hours HHTO (Holistic Health Time Off aka sick time), 16 hours floating holiday, 80 hours paid holiday, accrue 120 hours PTO per year

Advice: None
Pros: Simply the best paying job I've had, but I'd take less pay for less stress.

Cons: insular team, every new idea has to be in the "Microsoft way", tools are ancient (my team did not use git) and frustrating. having to work on Windows tools, too many onerous processes and procedures (you spend very little time coding). They don't understand industry terms and lingo. I was mocked for saying I am taking PTO instead of using OOF (out of office) to describe my time off. People who grow within the organization are preferred to people who are hired from outside when assigning new tasks
Advice: Please open your mind to new ideas when you hire folks from outside.

Pros: Work life balance is great

Cons: there can be intense competition for advancement opportunities
Advice: None
Pros: great company with lots of benefits, offers a wide range of projects, teams, and groups, providing ample opportunities for career growth

Cons: Company still isn't doing true Product Management and is much more Program Management oriented. Don't get me wrong; I am sure there are few products that do run a Product shop but I had been hard pressed to find them. Also, organization is very siloed and broken up so there are so many dependencies across departments which slows down how fast you can generate impact.
Advice: Lean into how organizations and products are broken up to transition to Product and release fast. Product Managers are complaining about the exp they are able to gain at Microsoft. Increase pay; FB and Google offers way more.
Pros: Company employees are very nice, helpful, down to earth and very family oriented. Opportunities within the company are plenty; I also think though no experienced yet that the troubles you have to get into a type of Product role you don't have experience in, is not faced once you are within. However, you do you have to go through all rounds of interviews like external candidates except 1 or 2 rounds if you are within the same overall organization from the top.

Cons: No free food

Advice: None
Pros: Slow approval process
Most valuable company

Cons: cpuld get hectic at times
Advice: None
Pros: Its a great place to be

Cons: Executive leadership seems to have become disconnected from employee's needs and reality. Can easily get lost in the noise of the company. You need to always be selling yourself to show impact and value. RIFs happen and can be large numbers and your impact to the business can be ignored.
Advice: Executive leadership always talking about leading with empathy, but they don't actually show empathy themselves. The 2022/2023 layoffs are a great example. Management dragged out the layoffs. Some L3 and up managers said "just be happy you have a job" or "have a backup job because anyone could be let go at any time". That should have never happened. There was little to no acknowledgement to the employees about the stress this caused them all while management continued to ask employees to do more with less while Microsoft showed record profits. I would like to ask Microsoft management to review the processes that they used for the last rounds of layoffs, talk to employees, specifically ICs, and change the process/policies to help reduce the stress that was caused to employees the next time this needs to happen. We all need to practice what we preach. If leading with empathy is something executive management wants to tell employees to do, then they themselves need to do that and be transparent with ALL employees.

Cons: Too many silos. 
Too many managers care more about developing and maintaining their "kingdoms"...than about solving problems. 
Promotion is way more about "cronyism" and "who you know"....than "what you do".
Advice: There's no such thing as "one microsoft", when every group has their own P&amp;L and cares more about that than the bigger picture...
Pros: Good people
Good working environment

Pros: Excellent culture, benefits, and interesting problems to solve

Cons: My least favorite part of working at Microsoft was there were those occasional people who were rewarded even after showcasing poor work ethic. But those experiences were few and far between and did not affect my daily working life.
Advice: Be diligent when rewarding your employees, look at all factors versus gross margin/revenue. Obviously, you want to reward those who deserve it, but reward diligently.
Pros: Microsoft has amazing benefits, most people you work with are absolutely outstanding, the customers are great to work with. While I was there, I had a very understanding manager who provided me flexibility in where I worked, going into the office wasn't a requirement, but I made it down maybe once or twice a month.

Cons: Bad managers, especially in Azure, so that's why there are a bunch of reorg.when you speak up they will retaliate in any form and exercise authoritative abuse against you by reminding you a minor mistake that even the manager themselves made over and over again. Also, the managers are liars, as they will come up with any excuse for favoritism or play favorites with only the people they hired.

Advice: None
Pros: What can I say.. Microsoft is the best company to work for in the world in 2024.

Advice: None
Pros: remote / hybrid work. pays well

Cons: -The Baller years were not great -Technical training is an issue -MSFT will let you work as hard as you want so your work life balance can get out of whack. -Some people do not like the employee ranking system but that is often because its not understood, its not terrible, but the company can do a better job of explaining exactly how it works. - The RIF's are always rough but sometimes necessary
Advice: Focus on bringing back in person, instructor led training, we have gotten by with recorded online training but we need to be in a class with our peers and a teacher from time to time. Peers help hold one another accountable, instructors/teachers are there to answer questions and also help hold student accountable. When people are in class together they build out thier network and establish connections that will help us solve the worlds most complex problems.
Pros: Microsoft is a Technology company built by engineers from the ground up and designed to be run by engineers. (Gates) The company had a dark period under Ballmer, but that’s because he was not an engineer and did not fully understand how engineers think and what they respond to and it was reflected in the flat stock for more than 10 years. We now have an Engineer at the helm again in Satya Nadella and the company is back on track to continue to do great things. Pros: -Great culture -You get to work with really smart people -Decent Salary -Good work life balance -Good top level managers placing the right bets at the right times.

Cons: disorganized at times
slow to move
Advice: None
Pros: nice work life balance
a lot of smart people

Cons: Everyone already knows this, the pay is not as good as other tech companies. It's also a relatively slow-moving player when it comes to product development, which can be frustrating.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft actually sells its products, which makes it resilient to market changes in, for example, the advertisement industry, and means its incentive is to empower and watch its customers succeed. This makes a huge difference when you're building products.

Cons: The rate of progression can be pretty slow and prescribed. It's also heavily dependent on the team and organization that you're working in.
Advice: None
Pros: Great leadership, lots of flexibility in your work style, great culture, smart and friendly colleagues. Open structure, and it's easy to network, meet people from all backgrounds and levels and pick their brains.

Cons: Stock Refresh is not good, espp is not good
Advice: None
Pros: WLB, benefits, FTO, management is okay

Cons: disorganized, people stay for a long time due to good stock, very political
Advice: None

Cons: stock refresh is very low
Advice: None
Pros: diversity and inclusion culture are good

Cons: There are no negatives to working here.
Advice: None
Pros: Great community and environment at the office.

Cons: Workload has been increasing and we could do with more resourcing.
Advice: None
Pros: Love the energy and talent of the people working on the product i’m designing for. I can’t speak for the rest of microsoft but i definitely don’t feel like it’s a “retirement home for tech bros”. The work is fast paced, the energy is high and i feel respected as a designer here, I am thankful for the eng and PMs i work with on my feature for that. Also i feel like leadership really care and want me to take breaks for a better work life balance.

Cons: As with other large corporations there's a lot of bureaucracy and rigid process. Hard for me to comment much further due to my short stint and unique situation with the corporate transition as noted above. They also were going to have us give up our MacBooks, which is hardly a surprise given that it's Microsoft, but that was very unpopular with most of the engineers coming into the organization.
Advice: None
Pros: I only worked at Microsoft for about 8 months after my company was acquired by them, but had a positive experience overall. A lot of nice benefits, good pay, and opportunities if you're able to find the right role for yourself.

My position was eventually eliminated and I was laid off, but was given 3 months of severance pay and felt that Microsoft handled the process with dignity. Obviously nobody wants to get that call, but it ended up being a good catalyst for my career and having the 3 months of full salary/benefits to take a break and job search was really nice.

Cons: gets hectic sometimes and can be stressful
Advice: None
Pros: great colleagues and chill work

Cons: It can be too overwhelming at times.
Advice: None
Pros: Surrounded by a lot of brilliant minds.

Cons: not enough time with the company -- had to relocate
Advice: None
Pros: too many to name to be honest

Cons: -Difficult to network due to departments and orgs being siloed 
-Culture varies organization to organization
-can be difficult to level up depending on organization funding
-no clear parameters on how to level up
Advice: None
Pros: -Tons of benefits
-Unlimited PTO
-Options and support to help you grow within your career
-No high pressure to deliver within first year of role.
-100% remote opportunities

Cons: Managers are more focused on delivering technology than supporting employees.
Advice: None
Pros: They provide excellent benefits as well as great compensation

Cons: Someitmes remote work is a probz
Advice: None
Pros: Good location of office nice people

Cons: Not many ambitious coworkers, worked with a lot of older people
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits, overall chill with good work life balance

Cons: Too much internal politics impacting everything
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is excellent

Cons: Microsoft like any big company works by the law of big numbers. If you hitch your wagon to a product that fails, you may find yourself on the layoff line despite personal performance. There is little to no effort to retain employees swept up in these broad reorganizations; each employee has to reapply to a new role on their own which often happens during a period of hiring freezes and uncertainty across the company.
Advice: Focus on *talent*.  We talk about impact, we talk about results, but we don't focus enough on the fact that someone's impact or results may be a side effect of not putting the right person, into the right job.  Nobody does as well when faced with something they're bad at or for which they have no passion, so why would we measure that?
Pros: There are few companies that cover as many industries as Microsoft. This means that you can spend an entire career, jumping from role to role, leveraging your experience at every step while never doing the same thing twice over decades.

Cons: work life balance and bonus structure
Advice: None
Pros: not good parking and the technology is old

Cons: 1. No decent way to submit formal internal complaints. 2. HR is outsourced and won't help you that much. 3. Low chance for promotion and upward movement. 4. Fired for nonsense reasons, with no warning previously, no chance for appeal. One day out of blue manager told me I was performing "well below minimum expect level", "cannot complete task independently", "do not respect company culture", "disrupt team environment", among other nonsense reasons. I have no formal channel to complain, manger's mangers (M2) doesn't take me seriously and say I lack respect for my manager's judgement. Next month I was terminated for performing well below minimum expect level and have no way to appeal. Left a message to CEO on Teams the day I left saying I have absolute confidence anyone I worked with, aside from my manager, will say I perform just as well, if not better than my coworkers. I know it doesn't change anything though. I would sue for wrongful termination, but I don't have money or energy to fight 10 years+ lawsuit with MS.
Advice: At least pretend to care about employees and not just empty talking all the time. For example, in 2022 CEO talked about doubling raises budget, but I end up getting only a 7% raise, the inflation is 7.5% plus that year. In 2023 there will be no raise at all, all I can say to that is LoL.
Pros: 1. Good company vision, value and culture, on paper at least. 2. Good benefits, promote a healthy lifestyle. 3. Compensation is OK too, at least keeps up with mainstream. 4. Most people are nice, for real, helpful and kind.

Cons: Because of it's size, Microsoft is massively process-heavy and lacks both agility and high performing teams. I've been unimpressed with the caliber of talent here, especially given the reputation. It's a company you could stay at your entire career, but if you're super highly motivated and don't like to "accept" inefficiencies then you'll quickly become frustrated.
Advice: Put more pressure on your teams to be change agents, to fix the broken or ineffective processes, and continue to elevate the high performers.
Pros: Microsoft has all the pros of a massive tech company - great benefits offerings, good culture, lots of fun colleagues, and good work-life balance. Employees are enjoying great financial results right now and it makes it easy to stay.

Competition and Performance Pressure: The competitive environment at Microsoft can be intense, with high expectations for performance. This can lead to pressure to constantly perform at the top of one's game and may impact work-life balance for some.
Large Company Environment: Working in a large company means that employees might feel like a small part of a vast machine. It can be challenging to stand out or make a significant impact individually.
Change and Uncertainty: The technology industry is fast-paced and subject to constant change. Microsoft employees must be adaptable and comfortable with uncertainty as business strategies and technologies evolve.
Advice: None

Cons: - Very political. Many managers are people who are the loudest and not the most knowledgable or capable.
- Experience varies by teams. Some teams are very toxic.
- Finger pointing and back stabbing culture
- Not as glamorous as it seems. 80% of the work gets accomplished by 20% of the people.
Advice: - Focus on hiring people that actually want to do work and build products, not people that want to rest and vest. These people tend to block and be intimidated by people that actually want to get work done.
- Be cautious that many managers are leftover from Steve Balmer's time and still have that mindset, or some team's still have that mindset. Be cautious that these people are not blocking the progress of others.
Pros: - Compensation Benefits (not the best in the industry though)
- Perks
- Health Insurance is very good

Cons: low salary compared to other tech companies
Advice: None

Much more pressure to perform and deliver under tight deadlines. Due to past layoffs, everyone had to take on more responsibilities for under-staffed projects.

PS: of course, this experience differs from team to team. Some orgs within MSTF still have great work-life balance. Some other orgs got it worse.

Cons: Feel bad for folks that don't work here.

Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft is transitioning into copilot company!!

Cons: Even if you're not in a sales role, you're expected to sell the latest stuff...even if your customers aren't there yet. Also, while the culture is very employee-oriented, encouraging, diverse, and focused on work life balance and wellness, it can be very stressful due to the demand to produce new sales. And they have their own internal language (and acronyms that have 12 different meanings) that takes a while to adapt to, on top of the fact that their products and features change so rapidly (including their product names) it's almost impossible to keep up. So be aware...onboarding is like waterskiing without skis; you get dragged while hanging on for dear life.
Advice: You never really have figured out the customer success role. That is a long-play farming position, not a sales position. You count too much on customers not wanting to do the work to move from your platform and don't give them enough help to truly leverage your solutions through decent support. This will come back to bit the company eventually.
Pros: Microsoft has amazing products and services for enterprise customers, so many companies use them...creating a lot of opportunity. The culture as a strong learning mindset and encourages people to grow and try new roles, so it's always interesting and new.

Cons: Honestly in 3 yrs of working here, I have yet to find any cons.
Advice: Don't change a thing
Pros: Microsoft is one of the few companies that I have seen that actually lives up to the hype. They leave no doubt to their consultants that the customer must come first and that the customer privacy is sacrosanct. I feel perfectly free to recommend competitor products when it is in the best interest of the customer. I have never seen a company like that. They also make it clear that honesty and forthrightness is a minimum requirement. So if there are "warts" in a Microsoft product, I do not get in trouble for telling the customer, I am actually expected to forewarn the customer. I can't tell you how fantastic it is to work for a company that has this mindset. I have seen many companies that "say" these things but I've never seen a company back it up with their actions until Microsoft. And they couldn't be more supportive of their employees - incredible benefits, training, transparency, etc.

Cons: Clunky corporate structure, hard (not impossible) for a single individual to make any kind of discernible impact. Essentially the same cons as any other large tech firm, no matter what they may say. MSFT, Amazon, Google, Meta: pick your poison

Cons: Health insurance while decent has a ridiculously high deductible for those outside Redmond. Senior management is clearly politically motivated and practices lip service when it comes to work/life balance and desire for diversity and inclusion. If you are of a particular category (in the US), you’re clearly being weeded out to help the company improve it’s look in the industry. Companies they buy are to either stifle competition, or to extend their beholden approach to anything. Then they rip the company apart very quickly thereafter. AI and automation is the future, all else be damned. They say the encourage lateral moves within, but clearly have their favorites and all others are ignored.
Advice: Treat your employees better. Don’t just say the words, take action. Go back to what made you a good company in the first place and stay out of politics, religious, and social issues. That’s none of your concern. Your world view is yours, but don’t foist that on ANYONE. You are guilty of the very thing you claim to be quashing - respect for diversity of opinion and worldviews.
Pros: I’ll say here what I’ve told colleagues elsewhere and family. “MIcrosoft pays me well for what I do.” The Perks+, the stock options and the 401K contributions were all appreciated.

Advice: None
Pros: Good buildings and soccer fields.

Cons: Base comp can feel pretty low for tech (although it is still a tech salary) especially given being forced to live close enough to campus to show up in person when required. General distrust of upper management due to multiple rounds of layoffs which still seems to be permeating my coworkers and the company at large.
Advice: None
Pros: Work-life balance is very good although I do see my seniors working much more than me. I'm able to work a traditional 9-5 primarily from home, about 4 days a week on average. Coworkers have been very nice, friendly, helpful, and understanding. Perks+ program feels generous. I can cover the costs of all of my exercise related hobbies with it. Working on genuinely cutting edge software and being a part of it all is genuinely an amazing and fun feeling.

Cons: Tough interview questions; photos of Bill Gates everywhere.
Advice: Get more photos of Ballmer.
Pros: Cool software, cool officers, good food.

Cons: The phrase "do more with less" is once again becoming toxic at Microsoft. First, it was do more with less, because Microsoft has been laying off people right and left — many of them totally unnecessarily. The work still needs to be done, but they just cut the teams doing it. My team was cut by 60% even though there is more work than before. Then, it was do more with less compensation, when Microsoft decided not to give raises to full-time employees (during high inflation, let's call this what it is: a pay cut). The, it was do more with less as Microsoft is reducing its budget for morale, equipment, travel, vendors, everything really. WLB has gotten worse. Compensation has gotten worse. Culture has gotten worse. Morale is the lowest I've seen in over a decade. And leadership appears not to care; worse, even to be daring people to complain, daring them to leave. It's not good lately.
Advice: Management needs to return to caring about its people instead of just shoveling money into AI partnerships. If they don't, then Microsoft is in for a MASS EXODUS when tech industry hiring starts to improve again.
Pros: There are still many good things about Microsoft. The compensation is fairly high (though not the highest), and the benefits are good overall. Many of my colleagues are smart, positive, helpful people.

Cons: - Most teams have developers spend a week 'on call,' meaning you need to drop what you're doing and log on if there's an emergency, even if it's 3am. The frequency can vary team to team.
- Pay can stagnate, no one received a baseline raise in 2023

- Some teams allow full work from home
- Good culture, with lots of communities that you can join. Doesn't generally encourage &gt;40 hr weeks

Cons: Microsoft's investment in people and morale has declined over the years. Moral budgets for things like Christmas parties were steadily reduced both pre and post covid. Policy of computer refresh every 2 years gradually became if the tech people cant fix your current one then you can submit a request. These are just two examples of the types of changes that have occurred over the last 8 years.
Advice: Remember that Microsoft is more than data centers.
Pros: Microsoft is the leader in bringing AI based solutions to the market due to strategic investments ahead of its competitors.

Cons: Over time the level of respect and support my team was given faded. Communication breakdowns and a culture of fear were established from top down in our division.

Advice: None

Advice: Promote more people with design acumen into management positions. Right now it's only people that are good at politics that I see getting promoted into high scale decision making roles.
Pros: Lots of talent to learn from

Cons: Politics
Corruption
DEI gone to the furthest extremes
Severe prejudice
Stagnant salaries
Low overall compensation
Horrible senior leadership
Violations of State and Federal laws hidden by Partners and VPs to protect themselves
Leadership politics against their own employees (especially at review time) to increase the raise and bonus pot for themselves
Merit increases and bonuses on a curve even though they say they aren't
Long work hours (20hr days) with no appreciation
Under/low experience staffing models
Advice: Look at all leadership below Satya. 90% of them are playing politics for themselves and care nothing for their people.
Discrimination goes both ways...when you have female Presidents that say the company has to fire all straight, old, white men...and then does so, that's not only immoral, it's also illegal.
Your Partners, CVPs, VPs, and Presidents are hiding violations of regulation, lying to auditors, forcing their personnel to hide compliance and security failures.
Customers are barely 2nd from last to your CVPs, VPs, and most Partners...but only because employees are last.
Stop promoting leadership based on their ability to cut opex, they're successful only because they're cutting what is necessary.
If a scorecard is green you're being lied to, but the lie is either from or directed by your CVPs, VPs, and Partners.
Your Presidents are leading through fear and it cascades and magnifies as you go down.
Your financial controls are terrible, but everyone is lying to you to keep you happy.
A high attrition rate should be grounds to fire a President, VP, CVP, or Partner. Likely it should be done in that order.
Every promotion you made to appease the DEI world is a failure...a female President in the company who was promoted to the position due to an article critical of a lack of female senior leaders is most likely not qualified at all.
When you have team building events where you tell everyone who looks Caucasian that they aren't allowed to speak (even if they're light skinned Spanish, mixed race, etc...) you build resentment, not teams.
Female leadership abusing and sexually harassing male personnel is rampant but the company response in the event of a complaint is to fire the male.
95% of your major security breaches are due to Senior Leadership hiding failures and threatening their personnel that they'll be fired or zero'd on review if they speak up.
Your SOX audits are a complete failure, you haven't funded the implementation of real controls but punish people like they are chattle if there's a finding.
You finance organization compliance personnel (not the ops teams, not the devs, not the devil's folks, not the security people, not the compliance people in the actual engineering teams) are the problem.
DEI should mean you have diverse views, what you have created is an environment where any view not approved of by the diversity police is unacceptable, that's bad for everyone including your customers.
Everyone knows that HRs job is to protect the company and everyone has accepted that, however, your HR organization is the biggest violator of HR rules in the company. Make them lead by example.
Don't force teams to use a new Azure offering if the offering is broken...make the team fix it first, then feel free to force everyone else to use it.
Your good personnel who know how everything works are burned out. When they tell you they need skilled personnel to support the workload and provide a well functioning, stable, resilient, secure, and compliant offering, listen.

Pretty good medical benefits in the US

Cons: tasks work chairs toilets coffee
Advice: None
Pros: money food people parking desk

Cons: If you're allergic to 70+ hour work weeks, don't come to Microsoft. GM's and CVP's will work you into the ground until you turn to dust and then just hire your replacement.
Advice: The broader IC team shared with me that they don't feel comfortable sharing honest feedback during internal survey time, for fear of retaliation. Take this seriously and identify GM's and senior leaders that are hurting the positive culture you say you want to build. All the "lip service" and heart emojis used in communications mean nothing. "Walk the talk!"
Pros: Good team, most want to help when they can. Great benefits and compensation which is required when mental health suffers due to 7 day work week, laughable "time off," and you need to leave for your own sanity.

Cons: Endless sea of management, many of which lack technical acumen immensely. 
Bureaucrats are rewarded for everything but the work required for their role.
Layoffs are always a worry.
Advice: Get rid of all of the excess management.
Pros: Quality of pay
Health &amp; wellness benefits
Workplace benefits
Best in class products

Cons: The executive assistants and admins make barely anything compared to everyone else. One bonus for an FTE is more than twice what an EA makes in a year. I matched the executive hours, and my pay was barely at a living wage for Seattle. 
On-call non-stop doesn't equal any promotions or bonuses for admins or EAs.
Advice: Give raises to the EAs, they're working non-stop. 
Listen to the admins and the EAs. They might actually know how to work a PowerPoint or Excel, unlike all the PMs you've hired for 150k.

Advice: Don't lie about how performance reviews take place and pretend that stack ranking doesn't exist. It's cruel and lacks integrity.
Pros: High pay, prestige, and scope of influence.

Advice: None
Pros: very good culture in the co.

Cons: Very little authority to execute projects because of the influence-based culture. Consensus has to be reached before anything can get done, and then every step of the way there are people who dissent, question, push back, etc. It is also extremely challenging to switch roles right now, especially if working for a manager with whom you don't work well.

This doesn't speak for MSFT as a whole, but people who stay at a place longer tend to have set preferences, don't want things to change too much, can be hostile towards people who are new and different in their approach.
Good luck communicating with such folks.

-Work-life balance is highly dependent on your specific team
-Technical problems also include working on legacy code that no one touches until they're forced to by a policy review of some kind
Advice: I see tons of examples that demonstrate the truism "a measure ceases to be a good measurement when it becomes a goal". KPIs like "no policy violations in code" become "push fixes/hacks and make the violations go away on the report". Sometimes these types of issues are indications that there are gaps in processes, not that certain teams are just "bad" at their jobs.
Pros: -Pay and benefits are ok
-Company isn't going to go belly-up anytime soon
-There are some real "world class" technical problems to solve

Cons: Difficult to move around internally, pay isn’t competitive
Advice: None
Pros: Fantastic employee benefits, positive company culture

Cons: Lots of work to do
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of money to be made

Cons: DEI is moving bonuses away from a meritocracy.
Advice: None
Pros: Innovative culture. Strong benefits and perks.

Cons: Lot's of politics. If you want to climb, you must play the game. Once you leave, it's almost impossible to come back.
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing Tech, some great people, some not so great,

Cons: Workload might be crazy sometimes but balances out
Advice: I had a great manager. I can’t say anything wrong.

Cons: Change is inevitable and happens more frequently than most companies.
Advice: Keep doing what you're doing.
Pros: Company is committed to long term view of technology and how it makes the world better.

Cons: One The flip side, the quality of your experience depends largely on the team you join.
Advice: None
Pros: The quality of your experience depends largely on the team you join.

Cons: Not completly transparent when it came to changes withing the organization that would provide employers with a sense of trust and job sercuirty
Advice: Management should take the time to understand employees apart of their teams as everybody operates different and you will only know that by spending time and getting to know your team  members 1:1 and actually listen and from there determine which management style to operate in when managing  your team members 
Pros: tons of resources to help you with your day to day tasks, tons of resource groups to join wether it was similar interests or cultures

Advice: None
Pros: Smart people and great benefits

Cons: You're a small fish in a large pond.
Advice: None
Pros: Looks great on a resume

Cons: If you were looking for a job that would support one or two customers, think again. You will be required to teach classes, travel on site with multiple different customers and constantly be on the prowl for more work. All on top of constant training (which is cool, but do it all on your time). The company has moved away from the traditional professional services concept and more towards an everyone is selling posture (think classes). It's thrilling if you are young or don't have a family. It's awful if you do have a family and are trying to maintain some semblance of a work-life balance.
Advice: Stop relying on Copilot for all your answers, it's a robot.
Pros: If you love chasing work and burning the candle at both ends, this is a great place to learn on the fly.

Cons: Tough to find an impactful project
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance pretty good

Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, money and career opportunities

Cons: Slow pace work. Bureaucratic divisions. Lower pay.
Advice: None
Pros: Good people. Great work-life balance.

Cons: Satya's been telling Microsoft that our espoused values and actual values need to get closer in alignment for years: values including manage/coach/care, collaboration, nonviolent communication, reduction in toxicity, no more stack ranking. It's probably a lot better than it was - I missed the Ballmer years - but still feels like a competitive environment where people gossip about how much other people suck, screw them over to make themselves look good, hyperfocus on negativity, all while seeming pleasant and friendly on the surface. People don't say the words 'stack ranking' but they still stack (or bucket) rank.
Advice: Do away with performance bonuses. Even letter grades like in schools have been shown to be damaging to collaboration, feeling safe enough to take risks, willingness to work on hard problems. I, for example, have been burned by taking on a hard problem and only solving it "adequately." Claiming you want to create a collaborative culture and keeping that system intact is hypocrisy.
Pros: Really trying with D&amp;I, a metrics driven effort that really shows. My group is way more diverse than any other software industry team I've worked with.
They're trying to be less toxic.

Cons: Overall slow career progression as manager positions are limited and there is a level cap for ICs.
Advice: None
Pros: Nice WLB, You can work from home all the time. Overall people are respectful to each other.

Cons: highly competetive and no work or life balance
Advice: None
Pros: Compensation package and career growth

Cons: The developer in our team is not doing a great job on quality control
Advice: None
Pros: nice benefits, ok WLB, and hybrid

Cons: Not paid as much as competitors
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is great

Cons: If you're unlucky enough to get a manager who still practices the "old Microsoft" culture, leave immediately. HR will not help you, even if they state they're there for you as well as the company. I was laid off but prior to that I experienced a toxic work environment with my latest manager. Micromanagement and unrealistic or unstated expectations were the norm and the environment was fully abusive and toxic. I don't attribute this to Microsoft but specifically to my manager. I wish that HR had acted sooner to remove this manager as the company lost many employees due to the culture she created after a reorg.
Advice: None
Pros: The stated culture is amazing. Most of my colleagues lived this culture and were wonderful to work with. You're allowed a very long onboarding time to get acclimated to both the company as well as your new team and role. Nearly everyone is willing to schedule a 1:1 with you to help you either while you're onboarding or anytime you need help. It's a very supportive environment.

Cons: Like I said, depends on the team. In a top down approach, the core values at the top aren't always mirrored the lower you go. People are people and sacrifice these values for deadlines and metrics. Promotions aren't always merit based and there's an affinity for hiring people from outside who do not reflect company core values into management roles that they have no experience in. Also, while there are a lot of resources available, finding out about them is sometimes the hard part. I worked here for years without understanding how ESPP and 401k worked, how to go through the process of taking certifications (for free), and other perks that are available to all employees. While this is not the end of the world, you do have to be proactive learning about what amenities are available to you.
Advice: None
Pros: Hub is awesome. Certifications are free and there are resources available to advance your career, if you can find them and take advantage of it. Benefits are great, especially ESPP and 401k matching. Depends on the team, but usually people are nice, helpful and easy to network with. This is especially true across other teams, as everyone maintains a customer-first mindset.

Cons: Get ready to humiliated by best devs
Advice: None
Pros: Great sustainability best place to work

Low pay compared to similar positions at other top companies

Pros: WLB is good. But it doesnt mean that you work here 2 hours a day. Its still 30-40 hrs per week easily.

Cons: Intense Competition: The technology industry is highly competitive, and this competitiveness extends to the sales domain. As a Sales Manager at Microsoft, you may encounter intense competition from other major tech companies. Meeting sales targets and securing deals may require significant effort and strategic planning. The pressure to outperform competitors and achieve ambitious sales goals could contribute to a high-stress work environment. It's important to be prepared for the fast-paced and demanding nature of the industry, as well as the need to adapt to evolving market conditions.
Advice: None
Pros: Global Impact and Prestige: Working as a Sales Manager at Microsoft offers the opportunity to be part of a globally recognized and respected technology leader.

Cons: Pay is not as good
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is good

Cons: However, I also faced some challenges and difficulties during my time at Microsoft. I felt that the company culture was not very supportive or inclusive of its employees. I witnessed several layoffs that seemed arbitrary and unfair, regardless of performance or seniority. Working for Microsoft requires discretion and prudence in your communication and interactions with others. At Microsoft, I found out that career progression is not easy. They talked a lot about support and training for the next level, but I hardly saw any employees being promoted. I also felt that the lower and mid-level managers were not very effective or empowering. They often followed the senior leadership’s agenda without questioning or challenging it and did not stand up for their employees when needed.
Advice: You cannot provide advice to those who do not care to listen.
Pros: I worked at MSFT for several years and learned a lot from the company. MSFT has a lot of talented and passionate people who are working on innovative and impactful projects. The company also offers competitive compensation and benefits, as well as opportunities for educational development. Excellent benefits + fitness plan (Perks+). Some really great co-workers. Excellent technology and a great place for learning and continuing education. Promoted "work life" balance culture.

Cons: Inconsistent management styles in some departments lead to a toxic work environment.
Advice: It's important to value the those that are actually getting the job done.    Try to extend opportunities for special projects to others that demonstrate the ability to grow and contribute rather than continually letting select "shining stars" remain in the spotlight. 
Pros: Great pay and benefits. Opportunities to grow career at various global locations.

Cons: Compensation is not as good as other techs

Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and smart colleagues.

Cons: In consulting space, you have to find your own projects
Advice: Positive reinforcement
Pros: Great benefits, unlimited PTO, good work-life balance

Cons: * There have been several rounds of layoffs late 2022 and Q1 2023. * You are encouraged to work from home as desk space is limited while new construction on campus is going on. * The company uses an open office work area. * You don't have even enough room to put a picture on your desk and it is noisy and hard to concentrate. * If you choose to work from home they do not reimburse you for internet connection or cell phone like other companies. * They have done away with accrued vacation and personal days and changed over to take time off as needed (flex time) "with manager approval" of course. * Several of use had just put in enough years to receive 5 weeks of vacation. Poof, gone! This is a way of saving money so when another round of substantial layoffs come along they won't have to pay out accrued vacation time.
Advice: You have done a good job of living up to the One Microsoft corporate policy so far. Please don't let that start to erode. Don't allow managers to layoff people after a reorg so they can get head count for a pet project. Or at least make sure they are accountable for their actions. Adopt an open door policy so employees can speak to their skip level manager when they have an issue that they don't feel is being addressed.
Pros: * Decent compensation. * Best Medical benefits compared to other multinationals. * Free Gym membership. * Work from home or remote is encouraged. * Stock is included as part of your compensation. * They will match charitable donations 100%

Cons: This is not exactly a "con," but is something to consider: It's a huge company that comes with a lot of complexity and various "work cultures." You need to be able to navigate through ambiguity at times and advocate for yourself. Working for Microsoft is not for the faint of heart.
Advice: Keep listening and diving in with the "model, coach, and care" mantra so you can effectively advocate for your team and the work that they do.
Pros: Great senior leadership, benefits, and work flexibility.

Cons: Depending on the team, Azure will work you like a horse.
Advice: Please minimize the number of teams where all (or nearly all) members are of the same ethnic background. This is a recipe for disaster. I sincerely suspect I was nearly 'driven' out by my boss due to this.
Pros: Interesting work to do, especially in Azure

Cons: Not enough opportunity to actually move up.
Favoritism over performance is too often the case.
Advice: None
Pros: Large org. and room to grow. Annual equity offerings a plus

Cons: Too much politics, poor review processes, salary not competitive with other comparable companies.
Advice: Focus more on making each employee productive and appreciated. Most managers are solely focused on making their boss happy to the exclusion of making their directs happy, which leads to huge overheads in constant reporting and too many meetings with repetitive powerpoint decks to trumpet the work being done.
Pros: Good people, exciting and challenging work.

Cons: None that I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance and benefits

Pros: A lot of team work and mentorship

Cons: Not many in person events/opportunities to network, can be challenging to get promoted.
Advice: None
Pros: Great perks, good work life balance,

Cons: There is still a lot of micromanaging that hurts employee morale and creativity. Many in mid-to-upper management are still learning to shift away from the old culture.

Microsoft's pattern of regular layoffs and then hiring new people is, for lack of a better way of saying it, cruel.
Advice: Put an end to micromanaging. Please.
Pros: The culture at Microsoft has improved since the beginning of the millenium. A lot. The elimination of stack ranking was a good move.

Healthcare coverage is excellent, as are other benefits (Perks+, flexible working location, etc.)

Cons: Yes, it is a big company. If there are any cons regarding this company they are, some of the typical things you deal with as a company of his size and influence. Sometimes things like strategies can feel a little disconnected as they are translated down to the front lines but in the end I have always felt supported in taking care of the customer. That is huge.
Advice: I have been blessed with some of the best managers in this company, so I unfortunately do not have much advice for them.  They stay out of my way and allow me to do my job and support me when I need higher level support.
Pros: Every year I am delightfully surprised of how great this company is. The way they take care of their people and foster a growth mindset is bar none.

Cons: Long working hours, a lot of stress, no work-life balance, bad management styles
Advice: See the cons

Cons: have to be reminded that u still have not been paid
Advice: Stay organized an ahead
Pros: Always remember to clock in and out document everything and stay in touch with you contract

Cons: Everything depends a lot on the team that you have, from workload, to hours you might spend working, from bonuses to vacations, working from home flexibility and potential promotions, they won't say it explicitly anywhere, but it does change quite a bit.

Cons: Lots of bloat makes it hard to be impactful. Many projects never came to fruition due to lack of clear goals
Advice: More guidance and direction
Pros: Very Good Benefits and better work/life balance than most major tech companies

Cons: There is a thick middle management layer that insulates senior leadership. The top and bottom layers don't talk to each other very well, if at all. Decisions get made without accountability being taken. "Corporate Culture" is something being fed to the newbies, but doesn't mean anything thing when business needs arise.
Advice: Management needs to understand the value of transparency and accountability. "The Business" doesn't do anything. It's people. People consume data, people make decisions, people take actions. Just own it. Don't shove your head in the sand and pretend things happen for reasons you don't understand. If there's lack of understanding and clarity around a decision, its only because management (or their superiors) don't wish for there to be. Everybody, at every level, should reject that kind of obfuscation.
Pros: I worked with tons of very smart people at the peak of their technical game. I don't think I could have learned more or done more in my specialty area had been anywhere else. Excellent opportunity to deepen my skillset and to learn some new things.

Cons: Not a competitive pay when compare to other companies.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance.
Opportunity to work on latest technology.

Cons: Sometimes navigating around a big company with people fresh off the boat is hard. The hierarchy ladder is cruel to climb.
Advice: None
Pros: A big company with a lot of opportunities.

Cons: None - no negatives from working here
Advice: None
Pros: Compensation is top of the industry

Pros: - lots of teams + good internal mobility means you can find teams that are right for you
- great benefits
- good culture - people want to help each other and it isn't hyper competitive
- decent diversity - still a boys club in some places, but getting better and better at supporting women, POC, etc.

Cons: Doesn’t follow through 
Culture is all talk, nothing to back up
People are last
Hierarchy is king, individual contributions are not important.
Advice: Think longer term. Be accountable to the values or ditch them altogether. Treat people well not just as pawns to get more shareholder value.
Pros: Says the right things
Solid benefits
Remote (for some)

Advice: None
Pros: Amazing benefits for full time employees.

Cons: - Development can be slow due to scale of company/product
- Politics can creep in, especially on the product management side.
Advice: A lot of time is wasted by folks on politics (I know this person, I've worked on that product, look how great I am) rather than getting work done. Find ways to cut that out.

- Variety of products and teams to work on or with

Advice: None
Pros: Good place for working in new york

Cons: Microsoft feels very collegial and not in a good way. People who have been there for a long time call themselves "Softees". The top corporate leadership went to similar ivy league schools and have been there for more than 15 years, so they protect each other. It's very tough being a new manager to offer a different opinion, it's frowned on. They say they want people of diverse backgrounds to participate in introducing new ideas, but it's mostly lip service, since direct bosses will discourage it. Some bosses are frankly afraid, since they don't know anything else besides the "Softee" way. Microsoft works in a matrix leadership instead of a pyramid, which is unproductive and very political, since you most likely will not just have one boss, but a "skip" boss too that will compete to manage you. Middle management gets stuck in the middle, so it takes much longer to execute projects than it should be.
Advice: Get rid of the mesh management system with skip bosses. It doesn't work. Hire people from outside of the culture to help make the company progressive.
Pros: Microsoft pays well and has the best benefits that I've ever seen for any company, especially for health insurance.

Cons: They are building products that they will scrap in 5 years.
Advice: None

Cons: Too many reorgs.
Perceived work-life balance not anymore

Pros: good culture and working environment

Cons: None that I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Good, liked it - recommend it

Cons: Frequent re-orgs. Compensation not at the same level as other "big-tech" companies
Advice: None
Pros: Good work-life balance. Good benefits. Supportive (so far) of remote work and flexible hybrid work

Cons: The layoffs this year were pretty nerve racking, dental insurance (Premera) sucks if you need anything extensive done, but for the bi annual cleanings are free. Also Premera insurance does not cover weight loss Rx (GLP-1) without extensive “try other methods” for 3 months PA requirement, which many of Microsoft’s competitors policies do cover. If you read up on GLP and employer plans covering them, Microsoft’s weight loss coverage is pretty archaic (will cover bariatric surgery at $30k but not GLP-1 which studies have shown, the current generations are just as effective as bariatric without all the risks associated with surgery)
Advice: None

Cons: Great company, new culture taking over and creating a much better work environment. No concerns at the moment.
Advice: None
Pros: So many opportunities to train and learn new technologies. Managers support and provide the opportunities to learn and apply your knowledge to new customer problems.

Cons: Recent layoffs have been a big concern with employees
Advice: None
Pros: Company Culture is best and have healthy work environment

Cons: The company eschews all other forms of technology except what they sell. The culture can be a bit smothering and long term employees move around inside the company because they understand the undercurrent of politics within the organization that I can only suspect that has been there for a very long time. It is rather cut throat, but not outwardly. Overall the various portions of the company vie to be in front of the customer as much as they can which drives how they are ranked and who receives the customer renewal money. It's an odd system that is now entirely arranged around their ARR.
Advice: In new portions of the organization, how and why do people that have been at the company 20+ years in a specific specialty end up leading and completely new one that they do not understand? When you acquire a new company, do it with the intention of actually integrating leadership from the new company into leadership at Microsoft.
Pros: Microsoft has extensive employee benefits and a lot of free learning opportunities.

Cons: Difficult to navigate the matrixed organization at times
Advice: None

Pros: great culture with great benefits, learned a lot

Cons: Nothing is bad at Microsoft
Advice: None
Pros: Very Good Condition, excellent conditions

Cons: Large Organization | Takes a while to make decisions
Advice: None
Pros: Great people | Awesome product line | Global Impact

Cons: -Stagnancy (easier to progress by moving outside the company vs. be promoted within) -Resistance to change (difficult to find teams willing to operate progressively or invest in truly radical ideas - still tends towards top-down strategy)
Advice: Under the leadership of Satya Nadella, the company has made significant strides on building a more inclusive culture that allows everyone to contribute the best ideas and collaborate effectively. There is still a significant disconnect between senior leadership (SLT) driving these messages and initiatives and the actual M1s and M2s driving these messages. Some of the same toxic behaviors that existed a decade ago are still present and the best I observed from some of the M1s and M2s was an ability to 'talk the talk.' A continued investment in transformation at the middle and bottom layers of the company will make the actual culture move closer to the aspiration.
Pros: -Culture (depending on team and manager, you can find strong inclusive and collaborative microculture at Microsoft) -Work life balance

Cons: The work isn’t super exciting
Advice: None
Pros: I enjoy the work life balance

Cons: 1. If your manager is not good, then your life will be horrible. Manager is the king. 2. They will put complete blame onto you even though manager does his side of mistakes, but only you suffer because of the 6 month reviews they provide 3. The Microsoft culture says about recognizing individual working style, be inclusive and all, but none of that would mean anything if your manager pins on the wrong side of all those things. 4. Not really good with work-life-balance either, the managers did not have any clue on how much it would take to implement a task and just push on pressure on every task I have had 2 really good managers though, but 2 horrible managers as well. With my 5+ years of FTE experience and 4+ years of vendor experience with Microsoft, I would say Microsoft has changed a lot after Satya came. You do understand that if the company does well for customers, then it means it would be horrible for employees right?
Advice: Please do not disguise or mislead your employees with all the culture BS if managers do not really follow them. All you want is pure business impact and so just be clear on that, so the engineers would not waste time on all those culture trainings.
Pros: 1. If you have a good manager, definitely your life will be good 2. Tons of learning resources, software and monthly $150 Azure Cloud credit 3. Excellent brand reputation as a Microsoft employee, outside of USA and outside FAANG companies.

Cons: Unethical business decisions.
Layoff US Cit with superior skills than H1B-visa holder.
Advice: Be ethical in all things that you do!
Pros: great pay great benefits. Health insurance is superb.

Large company...can be hard to have as big of an impact

Cons: Poor leadership, leadership needs to train a lot of their middle management
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits are better than most companies

Cons: Base pay stock grants and bonus is well below FAANG.
Advice: Why layoff 10k people and hurt moral? You know all of the other companies are laying off just the same and now you are hiring again just a few months later, and eating up all of your competitors layoffs.
Pros: Benefits are great!
Culture is good. Moving teams is ok if you need to. 
Stock has went up dramatically.

Advice: Give internal folks a chance before looking outside
Pros: Tech focused and flexibility in areas to choose

Cons: can be stressful from time to time
Advice: None
Pros: learned a lot at the company

Cons: - Behind in pay.
- Behind in raises for existing employees
- The benefits used to be world-class, but these days the don't cover anything real.
- They promote all the wrong people to leadership.
- Excessive outsourcing to India results in garbage quality unreliable products, ESPECIALLY internal tooling.
- Deadline-over-quality and bean-counting mindsets strong among management.
- All the "soft management theory" that made Microsoft unbeatable 5 to 10 years ago is gone now.
Advice: Tell Premera to cover stuff or you're going to dump them.
Stop promoting iPhone people to management roles.
Stop with the Indiasourcing of literally everything. You're getting scammed.
Pros: - You get to write "Microsoft" on your resume.
- Teams makes remote work simple.

Advice: None
Pros: Coworkers are intelligent and highly motivated.

Cons: Diversity and Inclusion propaganda was a little annoying. It is also a large tech company so there will be some bureaucracy to expect
Advice: Give employees time to just learn whatever they want. Also challenge  to be better and call out engineers when they write sloppy code.
Pros: Managers care about you and want to see you succeed. They are very flexible with the work-life balance and will work to accommodate your situation

Cons: Toooooo many politics and horrific DEI
Advice: Scrap DEI 
Pros: Perks and benefits are great

Cons: Too beauracratical and things can take very long
Advice: None
Pros: Great people, stability of a big company and lots of teams to explore

Cons: There was so many talks about special Microsoft culture. I didn't notice anything special at all. Even in start ups I felt more comfortable and had better team spirit. Management is a mess in Microsoft. No one really understand scope of taks, everything should be done yesterday. Manager tries to push down provided estimates and add extra work during the sprint. There's no budget to bug fixes. As results nothing is done in time and all blames goes to engineers. I worked for small start up and I know what is real pressure when the future of the whole company depends on the release. So I know what is hard work and I get used to work overtime. But in MS it's even worse, mostly because you efforts isn't recognized. MS culture promises life work balance and management pretend that they support this balance, but there's no such balance at all. MS push you to work overtime constantly, it's normal to work 12h a day and even on weekends.
Advice: None
Pros: 100% med insurance coverage for the whole family. Nice office if you use it. 401k 50% match.

Cons: For a top company, the pay isn't the highest.
Advice: None
Pros: Good Work-Life balance, good pay

Cons: Peanut world out here for everyone
Advice: None
Pros: Everything is peanut here, which why we are richest company in the world

Cons: The workload is really high
Advice: None
Pros: The benefits are fantastic. They care about you and your time

Cons: politics and review process is ruthless
Advice: None
Pros: good pay for local area

Cons: I don't want to get into that
Advice: None
Pros: good good good good good

Cons: Work can be slow at times. Sometime work on uninteresting products.
Advice: None
Pros: good pay, benefits, and wlb. SLT is great.

Cons: * Things keep getting re-orged and re-structured way too soon for a "stability". 
* As much as they say hopping within microsoft to explore is easy, it really isnt.
Advice: None
Pros: * Great culture: leadership focuses on sustainable growth. Lot of empathy overall. 
* Cross board learning: Plenty of sessions across different orgs gives you an insight of what are their top focus areas. Gives great visibility across.

Cons: Would’ve love to evolve from this position.
Advice: None
Pros: Can’t say I didn’t love this position

Cons: Work life balance can be a struggle
Advice: None
Pros: Great stuff, everyone is happy.

Cons: The matrix is still challenging to navigate and does not always serve its intended purposes. Go deep to research the particular product/ business you are interested in joining. Ask what % of time is spent managing internal buy-in, meetings, etc. versus on customers, experimentation, and learning.
Advice: Improve the speed and rigor of decision-making around either scaling up or shutting down lower priority/ lower margin products and services. This has improved over the years, but there are still too many legacy or low-pri areas of the company that stagnate without urgency around an updated strategy or other clear action.
Pros: Great "deal" overall across the board. Leadership is still spotty in some areas in terms of making the transition from "know it all" to "learn it all" culture, but the progress is clear and the SLT is bought in 100%. Great talent and opportunity to move within the company for learning and growth.

Cons: Poor leadership, toxic culture, no protection from false hr claims
Advice: Leave
Pros: Stay away unless you like toxic behavior

Cons: It gets hectic some time
Advice: None
Pros: work life balance is good

Cons: Sadly, I got laid off in the great lay off of 2022/2023
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits were amazing
Good work/ life balance
People were wonderful

Cons: Manager quality varies and is highly determinant of career trajectory
Advice: None
Pros: Easy work, chill culture, fun to be center of contemporary hype

Cons: Pay increase barely keeps up with inflation. Even if you have a killer year, won't really show that different on your bonus, raise. Pay just enough to keep you from quitting. Middle management is bloated to death, your manager has no idea what you do. They do nothing but posture and join useless meetings all day. My manager meets with me once a month so she can play pretend. Microsoft is no longer about solutions and is now about selling you things you don't need (where open source is a better choice). Technical consultants are a dying breed. If you're joining to grow your skillset in anything other than Azure, you're in the wrong place Bulls***t trainings that teach you nothing and are demoralizing and redundant Required certifications that are extremely difficult and teach you nothing Black box on how they decide bonuses (used to be a ranking system where there were empirical markers and now it's just a popularity contest) Require you do "extracurriculars" aka work outside work hours for free Money flows to the sales teams while those who work on the ground get the shaft
Advice: Focus less on pushing your expensive bloatware and instead focus on what's best for the customer
Pros: Very fair interview process where they care more about your potential than what you memorized in school Very laid back management (because they do nothing)

Cons: Benefits at competition (google, facebook, amz) are much better. 
Work/life balance needs improvement.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, somewhat flexible work location/schedule

Cons: No major challenges with organization
Advice: None
Pros: Well structured and transparent organization

Cons: Do more with less. less resources
Advice: None
Pros: Most valuable company. Good colleagues. good culture

Cons: * Poor compensation, both in base salary and bonus/stock (USA might be a bit better than Europe, EU folks take a massive hit)
* Lack of challenging work for those with senior experience, most of the effort is repetitive (rinse and repeat).
* Innovative ideas or projects are rarely given light of day, especially within the Services orgs.
* Management lacks technical insight (on average) and is more concerned with self-promotion.
Advice: Connects are not a serious career plan/tool for ICs. Pay more attention to peer feedback as opposed to Connects.
Pros: * Excellent for entry to early mid-level career stage.
* Lots of data to analyze
* Decent variety of cybersecurity sub-fields to focus on.
* Great learning opportunity especially for early career stage.

Cons: Hard to say. Compensation sucks.
Advice: None
Pros: Can't think of anything. We come back to fill it out if any.

Cons: Creeds without deeds, it’s a preached inclusion culture but it doesn’t follow through.
Advice: Development of real empowering leadership, and have a process for resolving conflict rather than favoring managers that violate policy. Open doors to empowering FTEs to have a path to growth and change. Stop creating new opportunities where internal employees can’t apply.
Pros: Work with lots of amazing talent that past through the company over the years

Cons: Layoffs regardless of personal performance
Advice: None
Pros: Smart people. Flexibility to change roles.

Cons: Toxic; cafe buddies one moment, shot-gun blast to face in meetings; everyone out for themselves
Advice: None
Pros: Exciting work environment; passionate people

Cons: If your department works on a bad product, the work will be very unfulfilling. Bing is one such department. Inexperienced manager.
Advice: None
Pros: Very good environment and systematic work. Encouraging colleagues.

Cons: No merit increase last year, no clear signal if we'll get one this year.
SLT points to stock growth, but given how mean the stock awards are compared to G and Meta, who cares.
Advice: Walk the walk
Pros: Good people.
Supportive immediate management.

Cons: low payment. stock refresh is pretty low.
Advice: None
Pros: good work life balance and good opportunity to learn.

Advice: None
Pros: Collaborative, aggressive company working on the cutting edge

Advice: None
Pros: Culture, innovation, work life balance

Cons: I am going to be completely vulnerable
Advice: None
Pros: Illllll look highly misunderstood due to

Cons: sometimes lack of development energy
Advice: None
Pros: Good technology stack and flexible work environment

Cons: A significant portion of DS managers do not have any management/ leadership training. They are suddenly thrown in to the driving seat to grow a highperforming team, and with no interest in properly nurturing a team, the whole culture crashes. DS managers waste time in meetings and showcase ideas, as their own; without involving direct reports who actually do the work independently working with internal customers. DS managers become risk averse and interested in only following the HIPPOs; rather than challenging inefficient leadership directions. They need to push back.
Advice: Do not promote everyone to manager track, just because they have interest. It's like sending your kids to a daycare with untrained, uninsured nannies.
Pros: Pay is decent; Work-life balance is quite good; (depends on the team) Interesting products.

Cons: A lot nowadays. The speak of culture but it is just lip service. The LT gives a preso on it but never is there any action items behind it. Seems a lot of new LT, managers that want to come in and change everything. Change can be good, but first learn the Microsoft processes before you determine it needs changing. Little to no trust in SLT, say one thing, does another. Unless you are a huge self-promoter, you will never go anywhere. Seems like 25 percent of the people, do the work for the other 75 percent who doesnt.
Advice: Betting the farm on AI is risky. There is a saying, if you treat your employees well, your employees will treat your clients well. Quit trying to hide the fact you manage out employees based upon someone's feedback that has an ax to grind. Managers are not qualified to be managers and the HR team sucks.

Advice: Continue to be transparent, candid, and supportive to your people
Pros: The company cares about it's people. Sure it's not the most warm and fuzzy, but compare to the relative brutality of the industry (unceremonious RIFs, RTOs, etc), Microsoft has been refreshingly transparent, candid, and also supportive of it's people.

Advice: None

Cons: Satya hasn’t really talked about culture since Jan 2020. The espoused culture and lived experience are VERY different. Who your Manager is means everything to your success and your career as a whole. Too much variation between leaders within and across orgs. Every man for themselves mentality. When you think you mattered, you’re really just a number. Everyone is very disposable. They will set cash on fire to lay people off than properly performance manage. Culture is sometimes what you can do to create a name for yourself to be recognized. Hired hundreds of people only to lay many of them off just a few months later. They will fix problems at no expense or money or your soul. Again, who you work for will dictate your success.
Advice: Fix your management culture. Everyone is often in survival mode and looking for short term glorification for the bosses to save their job. Stop massive hiring and massive layoffs as a lazy way to performance manage. Talk about culture more. Growth mindset. Stop giving managers who blame their issues on their teams a break. Hold managers accountable there are too many people skating by getting a free meal.
Pros: Nothing more I want than to write an amazing review about this company. They have all the potential in the world to be the greatest employer on the planet. They pay well. Good benefits at 0 cost. Exposure to an amazing tech stack. You learn transferable skills. Opportunity to interview for promotions but you’re on your own to fight for yourself.

Advice: Improved training is needed. The current training process is quite rapid and overwhelming right from the start. It would be advantageous to have high-achieving individuals within the organization provide instruction and demonstrate their best practices for a week at least. Too many changes and not enough people to help. Even the ones who are in charge of the change.

Advice: None
Pros: We were tightly knit and could find resources quickly because our unit was so specialized.

- Even when recognized for pushing extra hours my pay is not competitive compared to Apple, Meta, Google, and Amazon, it's way far behind,
- Senior leadership decided to invest in AI and acquisitions instead of raises for employees due to "global macroeconomic uncertainties" even that they pay is not competitive,
Advice: Everything is great except the pay. The pay for developers in Microsoft is far behind other big corporations. It's so bad that I'm considering throwing everything what's good in Microsoft away for a better pay.
Pros: - I'm surrounded by intelligent and respectful people,
- Some are very easy to work with and share knowledge when asked,
- Hybrid work and ability to WFH is amazing,
- I have a great manager (lucky me),

Cons: I was a huge Satya fan. But his leaders under him have lost their way. They talk about leading with customer first approach, but that is no longer the case. Back to the old days of we build it and industry will conform to what we build. The hiring of the VP for Services and his hiring of leaders over two years ago have yielded nothing. Zero direction from company leadership. All Accenture hires in UK, and nothing in feedback from any of them. So sad. I was a devote MSFT believer.
Advice: Start replacing your upper leadership. They are doing nothing. The hiring of the VP for Services and his hiring of leaders over two years ago have yielded nothing. Zero direction from company leadership. All Accenture hires in UK, and nothing in feedback from any of them. So sad. I was a devote MSFT believer.
Pros: Tech will continue to grow, so if you can manage to stay under the current leadership then you will make good money with stock benefits.

Cons: I was hired to solve customer problems but was terminated because I was critical of unethically pushing ChatGPT solutions to healthcare customers. The termination was remarkably sloppy, including lingering charges on corporate credit cards and threats to hit my credit. The contacts I was given to reach out for any issues were incommunicative. The company slogan is “One Microsoft” but corporate structure and incentives encourage a chaotic work environment where it feels like people are working against each other instead of with each other; it clearly manifested in poor management and product quality. Bonuses and stock options - a significant part of compensation - evaporated immediately after hire.
Advice: None
Pros: The clout and compensation were nice

Cons: The tech layoff's, not easy to be distracted by what is happening.
Advice: None
Pros: A lot is traction is happening at MSFT due to AI.

Cons: I joined News and feeds team at Microsoft with high hopes and enthusiasm, expecting a collaborative and supportive workplace. Unfortunately, my experience has been far from what I initially envisioned. The organization's leadership seems to lack the qualities of effective leaders. They not only micro-manage their teams but also create an environment that fosters toxicity and undermines employee morale. It's disheartening to witness the consistent favoritism and the tendency to gang up against certain team members. Such practices erode trust and hinder open communication, which are essential for any healthy work environment. It has become clear that the leadership's actions do not align with the values of fairness, respect, and professionalism that should be upheld. In conclusion, my time at Microsoft news and team has been marked by challenges stemming from leadership practices that hinder personal and professional growth. I hope that these concerns are addressed, and the organization can evolve into a more supportive and inclusive workplace in the future.

Cons: I’ve been at Microsoft for over 10 years. There was a time where I looked forward to waking up and going to work. I felt the work was challenging and rewarding. My contributions were acknowledged and I was learning from my peers and leaders. Over the past few years, however, I’ve seen a drastic change in culture. Priorities change frequently and result in poor work life balance. Mid and low level managers are focused on empire building and promote extremely toxic culture. On top of this, the company had layoffs and stretched it out over many months, keeping employees extremely stressed about job security. We were told to work extra hard during this time, as if to prove we had some worth, and rewarded for that effort with more layoffs and the announcement of no raises. All of this is happening during record high stock prices. It feels that management no longer values its talent and is just chewing and spitting out folks who have worked long and hard to contribute to the success of the company.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft stock has been doing very well over the past few years.

Cons: High stress having to do chat support.
Advice: More training. Make chat support less stressful.
Pros: Salary, benefits, meeting people from around the world

Cons: They cut people very easily and abruptly
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits are more than generous, they are stupendous.

Cons: Becomes very difficult to move from level 64 (Sr. Manager) to level 65 (Director). Highly political with many layers of oversight to get anything done, needing to go three layers up to approve internal decks and internal emails. Politics can create a highly toxic environment. Leaders pander to one another rather than doing what is right for the customer. Group Manager roles are a promotion in responsibility only, you double your responsibility and working hours with no additional pay until you can reach level 65. No guarantees that you will reach level 65 after working 70 hour work weeks. Certain teams have very little work life balance with a ton of expectation creating a lot of stress in the workplace. Operations are not available to support employees needs in marketing - can take up to 8 months to launch a marketing campaign.
Advice: None

3. On calls are too frequent and leads to sleepless nights.
4. No focus on employee growth.
5. Managers behave like cult members. They appear very cooperative and employee focused, and try to hide the real frustration in the team from senior management.
6. Very bad work culture.
Advice: Act honest. Accept the pathetic work culture and try to genuinely improve it (not just virtue signaling). 
Pros: Decent pay, well known name

Cons: You are encouraged to move to a new role every 3 years. You are also expected to move up. So, even if you love what you are doing, you will be forced to move up and change. Great for some, not great for others. There is also a point where age + income + too many years at level or in role = role elimination which happens every few years.
Advice: Understand that your audience is 18 -24 months behind the stuff your talking about today. Go back and demo and talk about what they can use today, not just what is coming down the pike.

Cons: Internal politics can limited your ability to grow and make decisions on your own.
Advice: None
Pros: I get to work on interesting projects that I am very passionate about.

Cons: Health insurance is a joke. They claim to have free health insurance just for your deductible to be extremely high. I couldn't believe my bill after leaving appointments. Layoffs have been brutal and even when they say you're safe, you're not. As they laid more people off, they just gave us more work until they were ready to get rid of us. But I guess it's still a business at the end of the day.
Advice: None
Pros: Pay was decent but the real money was in the commission. As long as you hit or surpass your quota, you will be making very reasonable pay. Perks+ and other benefits were great too and they covered our internet monthly. I was hourly so thankfully I didn't have to partake in Discretionary Time Off (DTO) and got paid out for my vacation. Flexible work-life balance and probably only went into the office 3 times out of my 2 years working for Microsoft.

Lots of old guard that will stay there until they are pushed out (can't make it somewhere else).

Cons: Work here is rather hard
Advice: None
Pros: Pay here is pretty good

Cons: I hate the review process as it feels arbitrary and, in some cases, its like a research project. It is also very inconsistent. My first manager had a slide deck where you had to research and fill in the values. Second manager basically said she does it off the communication notes. There is also a huge disparity in people's skill level. You would think being MSFT you would be with the best of the best and people who really know the platform, sadly not really the case. It turns out Microsoft ISD is like most places where you get good apples and bad apples.
Advice: None
Pros: Compensation package is great. Salary is competitive, though perhaps a bit on the low side - make 172k a year. Bonus last year was 30k and 48k in stock. Love the benefits, no charge for Health Insurance is awesome and the Perks+ stuff. You literally cannot find all of the benefits, people have spreadsheets to keep up with their are so many. The culture though is amazing. If you ever want a day off, you just need to ask. Teams are willing to help you and bend over backwards in an emergency. I love the people

Pros: Good Culture and working on good tech stack

Cons: Can be confusing to navigate
Advice: None
Pros: Large with ton so impact

Cons: Because my team was global there was no work-life balance. I tried hard to have boundaries, and carve out time for myself, but it was nearly impossible. Instant messages at all hours, expectations to respond immediately even at 10pm, and no way to effectively support that many executives within 40 hours.
Advice: None
Pros: Most of my coworkers were lovely people! I enjoyed that the company gives back and has a focus on philanthropy and volunteering. They also seemed to support innovation.

Cons: - I probably won't be promoted any time soon because it's hard to gain visibility and because of budgeting stuff

Implement mentorship programs and offer professional development opportunities to help individuals from underrepresented backgrounds advance in their careers. Additionally, set clear diversity goals and regularly track progress.

Remember, a diverse leadership team not only promotes fairness but also brings varied perspectives that can lead to better decision-making and innovation.

I also work for an amazing leader who treats his team like professionals. Compared to my previous industry, defense contracting system integrators, the compensation is significantly better. I'm not sure how it compares to other tech companies, but I know the culture here is significantly better. Beyond my immediate sphere of people I work with, Satya Nadella is an amazing human being and CEO. He promotes hard work, he is transparent, he handles communicating bad news well and promotes and lives by an inclusive culture.

Team

Cons: Long hours and increased scope due to layoff/ pressure
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of learning and development for career growth

Cons: There is no room for “standing still.” If you aren’t learning, growing, or solving world hunger you’ll get left behind. The firehose of information never lets’ up. Exec officers are beholden to shareholders and Wallstreet so don’t be fooled by their nice attitude and “empowering” lingo. You are a liability, not an asset.
Advice: It’s ok to have employees doing the same role for many years. It’s how you get great at something, you practice over and over.
Pros: You are not the smartest person in the room. Working at MS afforded me the ability to solve any problem as there was always someone to ask for help or guidance. Everyone is also very willing to help as success is tied to each other.

Pros: Culture , stocks and considerate

Cons: Limited chances for salary increase without expanding scope
Advice: None

Cons: Some people are frustrated with the small scope of what they work on or the slow pace but I think that's just a symptom of the size and complexity of the projects you work on at Microsoft
Advice: None
Pros: You get what you put in. If you want a good work life balance you can do that and be successful or if you want to put in a lot of extra hours you'll be recognized. Great pay and benefits.  Inclusive culture.  Easy to move around to other teams if you want to. My friends who were hired with me and didn't click with their first teams have mostly found new teams that they enjoy better.

Pros: Flexible schedule, you can work when you want to work New projects can test your large-scale design skills and help you develop a variety of skills and responsibilities Role for every type of personality on most teams - you aren't forced to be outward-facing if you don't want to be and vice versa

they were arbitrary. They chose at random.
They lost 3 top performers of the 5 from my department that were laid off.
Advice: None
Pros: Wonderful managers. Great working environment. Superior benefits.
Loved my job and coworkers.

Cons: Rolling layoffs: Microsoft has been laying off people pretty much once a quarter for the past several quarters. People who have been axed are confused and people who were spared are scared that they're next on the chopping block. Lack of pay increase: Executives and managers are getting bonuses , but the employees that carry the company are left without as the company complains of a waning economy. Satya made $55mil in 2022 alone, but this company cannot spare a small cost of living raise to their employees. 2-faced CEO: Satya continues to send out insulting "encouraging" and "ra-ra" emails to the company thanking them for their hard work and that the company would not be what it is without them...all the while as they declined to offer any monetary compensation for said hard work.
Advice: COMPENSATE YOUR EMPLOYEES
Pros: There used to be a large variety of free sodas

Cons: i've found the work to be boring
Advice: None
Pros: great benefits, stable and reliable work, the team i've worked on has had a good culture. good work life balance

Cons: Hours can be demanding. 24 hour on call for 1 week at a time.
Advice: Get staffing for 12hr on call shifts for engineers. All other disciplines have shifts
Pros: Results oriented culture where collaboration is encouraged

Cons: Pay is substantially below market value, reasoning is because they offer a “whole compensation package”. They say you’ll be paid $X amount annually, but they include the cost of health insurance and other random benefits, so your in pocket pay is $20K-ish less than the amount you’ll actually receive. I don’t know about Microsoft as a whole, but at the location I was at, higher up management doesn’t care about you or your work. They only care about the numbers that get them their annual bonus. Like a responsible employee, I put in a 2 week notice. Was walked off site that day, told I’d be paid for the two weeks, only to find out from HR that they wouldn’t be paying anything. So lost 2 weeks of pay. Luckily new employer actually fairly compensates, so me and the family aren’t not completely screwed for half a month. Lastly, they love to say there is upward growth. However every quarter they “don’t have money in the budget” or “don’t have positions for anyone” but will always have open positions to hire new employees. On that note, I was not a “disgruntled former employee” until the situation with my two week notice. Everything prior to that is an honest opinion of the company/position.
Advice: Properly compensate your employees and you won’t have retention issues. There is no reason someone should be able to go to a “competitor” in the same position and make literally 74% more money. Also instead of preaching the Microsoft values.. Try instead to actual represent the values.
Pros: Medical/Dental benefits cost zero out of pocket for family. Plenty of time off from day one. The benefits and time off is the only reason I gave 3 stars for “compensation/benefits”.

Cons: no problem with manager and company
Advice: None

Cons: I Can’t think of anything.
Advice: None
Pros: People, environment, culture. Microsoft is great and managers really care about you… the good ones. Unlimited DTO!!

Cons: There was a glass ceiling for me or lack of support for breaking it.
Advice: None
Pros: Top notch research organization. Great, supportive company.

Cons: They just keep taking things away. It started with the switch to "unlimited" PTO; then announcing 10,000 layoffs; then removing perks; then the most devastating blow (so far): no annual raises at all for full-time employees. Meanwhile, we're expected to still complete work at an increased rate, with less people (because layoffs) and for less money.
Advice: I understand that management's hands are tired here. It's really up to Satya and the SLT to make a change here. Management has been given the impossible task of motivating employees with zero morale budget and zero incentives. Seems like everyone (except SLT) has been put in a lose-lose position here.
Pros: Prior to 2023, the culture here was excellent. Very team-oriented, growth mindset, heavy emphasis on work-life balance and personal growth. Microsoft seemed to truly care about its employees. Plenty of perks as well, including gifts and generous bonuses and annual raises.

Cons: None that I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits are good and management is awesome

Cons: As mentioned above, it's a big, enterprise-focused company. The products tend not to be sexy and major decisions take time to make.
Advice: None
Pros: For better and worse, Microsoft is a big enterprise software company. While there's a handful of people working in consumer products (mostly in Xbox), for the most part the company is about enterprise software. And it is definitely a big company, and will often feel like one -- product teams are large, decision-making can sometimes be slow, and there are a lot of different angles to consider. But at the end of the day the company places people over process. There's very few processes that are actually mandated across the whole company, and few times the process can't be adjusted to fit local circumstances. Being a big company has other advantages -- it's a company your family has heard of with products they and hundreds of millions of others use. And because the company is so large, you can change jobs within the company and do some very different things. Microsoft's not grown as fast recently as some other companies like Facebook, which means somewhat older employees and more experienced managers. Medical coverage is very good.

Cons: None, I am very happy
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefit, it was a good decision

Cons: as a man in my late 40's I was constantly held back for promos. My sense is that this is still the case. I applaud the focus on diversity but worry about its impact on young men starting their careers there.

Pros: - Ignites creativity
- Amazing culture
- Great manager and leadership

Cons: My opinion of most businesses in the world and most industries, they force to much work on too few people. I'd love a raise, don't get me wrong. But I'd rather have more people on my team to spread the work around more.
Advice: Hire more people
Pros: I personally think the benefits are good for me and my family. But others, a few, do not like them. I think it is personal on works best for you and your family and if you have family on these benefits.

Cons: please stop making this app hard to use
Advice: None
Pros: very cool i love coffee

Cons: Big company, many layers, things move pretty slow. Hard to navigate at times and know what team or individual can help unblock something. Communication between organizations is not great in my experience. Inefficient processes seem to be hard to change.
Advice: Don't just talk the talk, but walk the walk. It's not enough to say you're listening but then nothing happens and no change is implemented.
Pros: They try really hard to take care of their people and they're very flexible when it comes to work and personal life. The compensated package is really good and the office locations in Reston are very nice. You will work with a lot of smart people that don't have big egos for the most part.

Cons: Complex organizational structure might sometimes slow down decision-making processes. In certain teams, the workload can become overwhelming, necessitating effective time management and prioritization skills. Occasionally, communication gaps between different departments can lead to inefficiencies
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft fosters a culture of innovation, offering numerous opportunities for career growth and skill development. The work environment encourages collaboration, and the company's global impact is truly inspiring. The comprehensive benefits package and flexible work hours are definite advantages.

Advice: None
Pros: Great people to work with

Cons: bad work life balance and leadership
Advice: None

Advice: Be transparent and open
Pros: Great company! Amazing colleagues to work with!

Cons: They often have RIFs unexpectedly.
Advice: None
Pros: Excellent corporate support from management

Cons: - The only training I've had in the last 4 years was diversity and inclusion training. - The latest - culture conversations - literally taught "there is no such thing as individual accomplishment". I didn't understand how this could be consistent with the stack ranking process but with the latest announcement it now makes sense. With this year's 0 merit and "historic" bonus levels (i.e. low) announcement its already been communicated that no one will receive rewards above the average target rewards that everyone will receive regardless of their level of impact. Thanks! Now I have no reason to even try to work or be concerned about impact.
Advice: - if there's no budget to replace my 5 year old desktop and we have to RIF 10,000 FTEs and kill entire teams and products, why is there budget to pay everyone left in the company a half day salary to attend culture conversations and diversity training? - why is it that non-D&amp;I protected candidates can't even move internally without the hiring manager being required to justify why 2 or more D&amp;I protected candidates shouldn't be hired first?
Pros: - Compensation &amp; Benefits - If D&amp;I is your religion, you'll have overwhelming opportunities to praise and worship

Cons: As someone who was laid off, I think the strategic sales teams are far more at risk for reductions than other teams. I also think Microsoft is at times too large. I would recommend joining anything in communications, engineering, product management, or any other field where you are building something tangible. Also, be careful of "Program Management" roles that are vague in their description.
Advice: Support employees by pointing them to tangible areas in the organization that create value. This could be special projects, hackathons, etc.
Pros: There were amazing things happening within Microsoft. Generative AI tech, awesome products, smart/sharp teams.

Cons: Cross org work can be hard
Advice: None
Pros: Good environment. Good growth opportunities.

Cons: Lots of ambiguity some times making it somewhat difficult to track impact.
Advice: None
Pros: Remote eligible makes work from home great.

Cons: Review system and bad managers
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance. Good benefits

Cons: - Enormous changes post COVID; a lot of churn; I came in with a original group of a dozen employees. A year later maybe three or four still remained. Losing co-workers that you've developed relations is difficult. - Compensation somewhat behind other tech companies, startups, partners, etc. - Expectations of work can be brutal, sometimes you will hit 60/h weeks during releases. - Frequent management changes. It can be difficult to get promoted when you have a different manager every year.
Advice: - Increase compensation and when communicating with employees - "Less is more."
Pros: - One the best tech companies in the world - Amazing supportive people that are interested in things beyond money but making the world a better place with technology

Cons: No rotating shift stuck on nights , company refuses to rotate employees
Advice: None
Pros: 3 days on one week 4 days on one week

Cons: - Some bureaucracy/disorganization
- Use of legacy tools/codebases 
- Not diverse
Advice: None
Pros: - Room for advancement
- Opportunities to work outside of your main domain (learning)
- Relatively "safe" from recessions

Cons: Many teams working on similar work which leads to internal competition.
Advice: None
Pros: Great opportunities and projects to work on.

Cons: - bad WLB in Azure 
-
Advice: None
Pros: - Stable job
- good WLB outside Azure
- Remote position, can work from anywhere

Cons: You will be extremely busy with learning new products, keeping up with administrative tasks and balancing a lot of meetings. However, you learn quickly on what to prioritize and where to invest most of your time (meeting with customers is the most important).
Advice: Reduce sales tool complexity and make sure that sales reports and metrics are aligned so that what sales is paid on matches what management prioritizes.
Pros: While daily life can be hectic, the company prioritizes time off and personal well being so you can take time off as needed to refresh and recharge. Sales leadership is very supportive if you reach out and clearly articulate what you need. As with any large company, you have to be good at navigating the complexities of each org, but it's worth investing the time in learning where to go to find answers. If you stay the course, max out your 401(k), employee stock purchase plan, and stay invested for the long term, you will have a nice nest egg to retire on. This is one of the best companies to stay with for the long term. Job hoppers will not do well here, but it is a great place to explore different career options within the company.

Cons: I love Microsoft, but teams and environments can be toxic and unbearable.
Advice: Advise managers not to give up on their employees or take sides,
Pros: You are not safe anywhere; so don't play safe. Dare to play hard and not be afraid of failure.

Cons: Bureaucracy Back to back meetings Constant reporting culture Growth Mindset is a talk, if you make a mistake, you’re pilloried Performance based review system and bonus (called Connects, now rated against a line b. bell curve but still works the same with expectations of percentage of employees at all stages)
Advice: You built a precarious inclusive culture on the backs of employees who demonstrated vulnerability in sharing their stories and then you riffed them and stopped investing in D&amp;I budgets. Don’t say you care when you’re not prepared to put your money where mouth is. Don’t say you’re a Learn it all culture when you divest in L&amp;D resources Your expectations of managers during COVID was high but your support for managers was poor, upper executives didn’t match support for the managers that took incremental emotional load.
Pros: Smart people New AI innovation Overall compensation package Hybrid work

Cons: Microsoft isn’t for those who are comfortable being in one specific position for three or more years. They will reinforce the need to self-develop and learn new skills. It's not uncommon for lower-level positions to be changed around or reclassified, so employees need to keep moving forward into greater Microsoft.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft benefits are amazing They vigorously promote from within (can be a con for some) Awesome work-life balance

Cons: Not all teams display the Microsoft culture
Advice: None
Pros: Interesting work
Executive wants to create a good culture

Cons: The work can be fast-paced and changes seem to come out of nowhere with little warning from leadership. But that is often true in any large organization.

Cons: Bad management Creating a fear culture HR is a waste of time Culture has changed drastically in 2 years Get a bad manager and you’re life will be awful.

Pros: Great benefits
Amazing wlb
Amazing team

Cons: Pay is not as good as other competitors
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of teams and opportunities

Cons: Management chain is a drag on completing work Org structure has too many managers who do not know what they're doing HR, C-Suite, and upper management could care less when your manager sucks Is more interested in keeping the "good ol' boys club" rather than acknowledging failure or accepting that alternative solutions are more effective Your new ideas are a threat to the company and their management chain Management doesn't know nearly as much as you, so they try to put you down and gaslight you HR could care less that you saw bad things, motto, "See something, report it", but reality is, "reporting something means you're the next to get fired" Mission statements are there only to lure you in, make you think they do good. They don't follow the mission themselves. Complete con-job
Advice: Review your own self worth cause you're degrading the company value, capability, and progress. If you cannot build it, don't act like you know how and stay out way of those who are actual professionals at computing. If you have mission statements, FOLLOW THEM! I cannot express enough how pathetic your execution of the mission statements was. Yet you pitch them in meetings like you follow them. All lies.
Pros: Challenging work Large variety of type of work to do Variety of people from all different walks of life

Cons: Constant reorganizations are frustrating. 

Promotions aren’t clear
Advice: None
Pros: Enjoy working with smart, knowledgeable individuals.

Cons: Long work hours &amp; can be demanding
Advice: None
Pros: Good work environment &amp; friendly ppl

Cons: PTO - We have 3 weeks of PTO which is good compared to the average two weeks off but not compared to other tech companies that start at 4 weeks off or have unlimited PTO. In addition, you have to wait 6 years for an increase in PTO. Team sizes - I was surprised by how many people were on a team. The smallest team I've been on is 14 people and the largest has been 19. My last company capped teams at 10 people and I felt like I had a much closure working relationship with my manager. I struggle to get meaningful time with my manager with a team of 19 people right now. Work/life balance + Stress - Depending on which customer I am working with the role can be very stressful. I find it pretty hard to detach from work at the end of the day and often stress dream and lose sleep. This is stress I am getting from the customer, not from my manager or other internal leaders.
Advice: Consider offering more PTO and making the teams smaller
Pros: I love working at Microsoft. We have great culture and amazing benefits. A few of my favorites are the 50% match on every dollar that goes into our 401K, the generous stock bonuses each year, $1500 a year to go towards fitness/wellness needs and no monthly health insurance premiums. Lastly, we just have really good people! I very rarely work with anyone I don't get along with and have made some really great friendships!

Cons: low comp compared to competitors
Advice: None
Pros: fast pace
interesting work
smart colleagues

Cons: Seen as an intern role with experience when role states apprentice could someone without any background and to build them up. Was the biggest barrier, do your best and network with everyone. Maybe consider going into office with the team that is hybrid.
Advice: None
Pros: Remote, all equipment setup, paid weekly, hands on coding experience, learned Typescript and software development experience was valuable to see the day to day life of an engineer and project life cycle.

Cons: No Cons at this time 
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing opportunity, well positioned products and capabilities.

Cons: Pay is not as competitive as peer companies.
Advice: Increase pay to keep top performers!

Cons: salary
location
tech
Dental
Learning
Advice: NA
Pros: Work life balance
tech
benefits
401k
Health insurance

Cons: Massive company means everyone's jobs are smaller with more overlap. You will spend more time doing "alignment" with other internal people on a lot of days than you will do the actual work.
Advice: None
Pros: Extreme scale - opportunity to work on things that are global and huge. Tons of smart people in every field. Strong brand, good ethics. A company you can be proud of.

Cons: No downside of being in the company
Advice: None
Pros: Work culture is really good.

Cons: nothing much in general in company
Advice: None
Pros: work is good over there

Cons: Slow moving teams and hard to make an impact
Advice: None
Pros: Healthy work life balance is great

Cons: No problem working at Microsoft
Advice: None
Pros: Nice place to work great

Cons: Stuff moves really slowly, culture depends on your team and in my experience there isn't much you can do to influence your team culture. The employee demographic overall is on the older side, which isn't a con in itself but if you're young/fresh out of college don't expect to meet a lot of peers who you'll want to socialize with after work. Also in my team the onboarding for new grad hires is nonexistent and I see the new grads being stuck with busy work while interesting/high impact work is reserved for people who have been at the company for 10+ years.
Advice: None
Pros: WLB, benefits, all that is great. Work is generally very laid back. Moving teams within the company is doable because it's unlikely you'll be ignored by the hiring manager since you are already an employee, however you still need to go through the whole interview process.

Cons: There were no cons at this place
Advice: None
Pros: Everything was good at this place

Cons: I was laid off for performance without any performance review
Advice: very poor management. Do not closely monitor work. relies on peer feedback only.
Pros: Has good work life balance

Cons: i didnt like the windows
Advice: None
Pros: nice pc to play with

Cons: Horrible Manager, work wasn't impactful
Advice: lol
Pros: Work with some of the smartest people.

Cons: Pay is less compared to FAANG companies, I've seen people quite Microsoft due to bad managers (so happiness may vary based on teams), work-life balance can be bad during some crunches, live site support will be mandatory if you work on the web.
Advice: Make the hiring process better, improve pay for people, if you cut people and freeze hiring, expect every aspect of the product to deteriorate and build up engineering debt that you'll never be able to pay back and forever take hits on productivity and dev velocity. More investments in engineering culture.
Pros: Flexibility, work-life-balance, some of the benefits are nice (stayfit reimbursements, donation matching, 401k 100% match, unlimited time off, etc.), lots of internal technical resources so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

Cons: Products are difficult to use (and sell). Marketing will be unimaginative, not a lot of room for creativity. An overinflated sense of urgency and self importance drives a tendency to overcomplicate work. You'll likely be in meetings all day. Biggest con of all: The company talks a lot about diversity and inclusion but one manager who doesn't understand you will smear your reputation and end your career. And even if you had 11 great years there prior to being re-orged to him, everyone will stand behind him.
Advice: Listen to employees when they raise flags about managers who are creating circumstances that prevent success. And make sure your white male managers learn to receive and value feedback.
Pros: Good pay and benefits package. Smart colleagues. Fun problems to solve. Well fleshed out teams.

Cons: Large company means things take longer, leadership makes decisions
Advice: None
Pros: Opportunities, growth, smart/collaborative environment, people

Cons: Experience depends on the team. I had a bad experience (3 different managers in 18 months-- two of whom left on one days notice). Others had better experiences on other teams.
Advice: None
Pros: Smart, driven people; large budgets; great benefits and matching giving program

Cons: None, its a great company to work for
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture and work life balance.

Cons: Super team dependent company. I quit because of my team environment and work-life balance. Standing up for myself unfortunately only made it worse. Politics!

Cons: Very large organization with mid level managers trying to keep their jobs makes it a bit of a rat race at times.

Advice: None
Pros: Everything benefits and pay are great

Cons: Base pay may grows slow
Advice: None
Pros: Base pay, bonus and benefits are great.
Many 100% remote positions.

Cons: Lived experience of the culture is still varied across a spectrum, depending on where in the company you work. Largely determined by your direct manager and/or the leadership above them. Pressure to deliver and individual results often still trump contributing to the success of others and leveraging the work of others (how) vs. just the "what" of delivery no matter what damage was done to achieve it.
Advice: Honestly evaluate your own MINDSET and how that matches with the aspire-to culture. Make adjustments where needed. Then MODEL the behaviors of the culture , really. That will accelerate the culture change, morale, productivity, learning, and ultimately innovation across the company.
Pros: Incredible benefits, opportunity to impact and change the world (literally), work with and learn from some of the smartest people on the planet.

Cons: I honestly prefer apple for my work

Layoff can happen at anytime.
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture: Managers are very open.

Good salary package.

Cons: You’re literally just another number 
Microsoft pretends like they care, will string you along, and then lay off hundreds of thousands of employees without notice

Cons: Since the CEO took a raise last yr then laid off about 20,000 people the fear mongering is at an all time high, every day you stress if you'll be next. The ranking system Balmer had was removed but brought back this year as a scale. It's a dumpster fire. Lie and kiss your superior feet but make sure you are toxic then you are promoted. Do your job you are passed over. They claim DEI but they don't live it at all. just more lies and puppets of senior leadership team. No loyalty to anyone but walstreet.

Pay people what they are worth and leave the stick/carrot up to the IC to determine whether personal time off is more important to them in the current FY or ADDITIONAL, aka rewarded for going ABOVE expectations, pay is more important to them. Rewards should not be lumped into my base value of worth for doing the job, yet they are.

Advice: None
Pros: good work life balance and culture

Cons: As a new hire I've never felt more lost than I have at Microsoft. I've worked at 2 other companies, one of them being a fortune 500 company with a big tech sector and while I have the most experience starting this job it is by far the hardest to excel in. It's hard to get others to help because everyone's remote, and the environments we work in is so convoluted and hard to understand. I've been here a year and still feel like I started yesterday. Also, there is a new initiative to increase velocity, but they also announced no raises this year. So basically, doing more work for less money. The worst is how much it affected my mental health. I've started seeing a psychiatrist because this job has been so draining and has caused depression. Just today I was hoping to focus on one area of frontend work, but then I got recruited to do some backend things which I'm not familiar in and investigate some logs.
Advice: None
Pros: Great pay and benefits and if you like working from home they fully support the work at home model.

Cons: very hard to advance, need to get hired high level otherwise very hard to advance
Advice: None
Pros: Good people, interesting work, wfh is really good

Cons: Pay, doing several jobs but not being fairly paid, not recognized for hard work. Leadership at the top has no clue of what we are doing and how to help make things better. There is no real path for promotion- it's harder to obtain a new role then leaving and reapplying. They base your position on a level and some jobs have such a high level that you can't even apply to them. This is wrong- if you leave and come back, leveling is not an issue. So, being a valued employee for several years holds no weight.
Advice: Levels should not be accounted for when employees are trying to move up and get promoted. Your experience and performance are what should matter. Finding more ways to make retail employees more marketable and a chance to get to corporate positions should be more supported.

Pros: Sales Resources for Sales team

Cons: Can have a bad team or a good one
Advice: None
Pros: Many nice intern events and activites

Cons: - The promotion system is horrible and does not reward talent and "impact". Your promotions are dependent on not just your manager but also your skip level manager. Even after working on multiple high visibility projects, demonstrating strong technical and leadership skills, as a woman you will have to prove all those items twice as hard as men at this company. That goes for minorities as well.
Advice: Rework the promotion system so it is less polically driven, and more objectively driven. As a tech company, you should be rewarding technical expertise and impact objectively and less subjectively. Women and minorities are still facing a glass ceiling for promotions from level 1 and 2 to senior and up. If you are truly about diversity and inclusion, then take a harder look at your promotion system.
Pros: - Ok pay - Good benefits - Interesting projects

Cons: Still a massive company with massive company issues. Hard to get promoted. People stay in the same role for a long time.

Cons: Working as a Web Developer at Microsoft has been an enlightening journey, but like any experience, there are a few drawbacks to consider. While the positives are abundant, here are some cons that I've encountered during my time at the company: Bureaucracy and Size: Microsoft's vast size can sometimes lead to bureaucratic processes. Decision-making can be slower due to multiple layers of approval, which can be frustrating when you're eager to implement innovative solutions quickly. Fast-Paced Environment: While the fast-paced nature of the tech industry is exciting, it can also be demanding. Tight deadlines and ambitious project goals can sometimes lead to high-pressure situations, affecting work-life balance. Complexity of Projects: Given the company's focus on cutting-edge technology, projects can sometimes become quite complex. While this presents an excellent opportunity for growth, it can also be challenging and overwhelming, especially for junior developers.
Advice: None
Pros: 've had the incredible opportunity to work as a Web Developer at Microsoft, and let me tell you, it's been a journey filled with growth, innovation, and unparalleled experiences. Here's why I absolutely love being a part of the Microsoft web development team: Cutting-edge Technology: Microsoft is at the forefront of technological advancement, and as a web developer here, I've had the privilege of working with the latest tools, frameworks, and technologies. This constant exposure to cutting-edge innovations has not only enhanced my skillset but also kept me excited and motivated every day. Collaborative Environment: The work culture at Microsoft promotes collaboration and teamwork like no other. I've had the chance to collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry, and the brainstorming sessions, code reviews, and pair programming exercises have significantly improved the quality of my work. Continuous Learning: Microsoft places a strong emphasis on learning and growth. The company offers various learning resources, workshops, and conferences that have helped me stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving web development landscape. The continuous learning mindset here is truly inspiring. Impactful Projects: One of the most satisfying aspects of working as a web developer at Microsoft is the chance to work on projects that have a global impact. The products and services we create touch the lives of millions, and knowing that my code contributes to such impactful solutions gives me a sense of purpose. Diverse Perspectives: Microsoft is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment. This diversity of thought and perspective has enriched my problem-solving abilities and has opened my eyes to new ways of approaching challenges. Work-Life Balance: Despite being a tech giant, Microsoft values work-life balance. The flexible working hours and remote work options have enabled me to maintain a healthy equilibrium between my professional and personal life.

Pros: work life balance with happiness

Cons: Performance reviews plan to manage a percentage of the workforce every year Hard to stay employed there after the age of 60 you can't be happy in a position and not wish to advance. Quit allowing people to evaluate their peers that they compete with in performance reviews reward teams over individuals Everyone deserves a sabbatical
Advice: The perception that no US employees retire from Microsoft seems pretty accurate to me. Quit laying off people over the age of 60. Quit allowing managers to not give bonuses to someone that has been there 20+ years and has never not had a bonus before. Don't expect everyone is wanting to move upward in their career.

Cons: Haven't found any downside yet. It's great.
Advice: None
Pros: Honestly the best corporate leadership culture out of any company I've ever worked for. Management says they care and it's evident in the way they treat people. Their actions actually match their stated values. Which is pretty amazing. Benefits are good pay is good it's really hard to beat. But the healthy non toxic culture would make me stay even if i was offered significantly more money. It's that important. Also remote work. No amount of money would ever convince me to go back to an office and so far they 100% embrace remote for some positions so I'll likely be here for a very long time.

Advice: None

Cons: not too much cons old fashioned software engineering company
Advice: None
Pros: nice environment great culture nice facilities

Cons: -CFO office runs our strategy and R&amp;D now, not technical leadership (IBM spiral) -Middle management ("frozen middle") runs the place, and has suffocated any and all creativity and drive to take pride in quality of work out of the ICs. -Promotion decisions in last 2-3 years have been even less rational than crony days of yore; people completely unqualified for the role and responsibilities they are being given slotted in for political agendas and being given far more chances to fail than anyone before them; ICs paying the price. -Last of the long termers advantages to staying were eliminated with the guaranteed holidays. Now, you can be here 1 day or 20 years, and you are the same. New system will be abused heavily by "frozen middle"
Advice: None. They don't read or care about the opinions of us peasants.
Pros: Used to have better WLB, increasingly not so much. Medical and Stayfit are better than many places. Otherwise, only Pro remaining is you have a job, and usually pays better than 80% of other places, but not if you are a talented veteran. If that, you need to leave asap.

Cons: continual underpayment even during the boom years, and now that the economy is down that pay differential feels worse. At least more people kept their jobs than at higher paying competitors
Advice: None
Pros: Chill culture, smart colleagues, interesting work with lots to learn

Cons: micromanagement and not enough self autonomy
Advice: none
Pros: pay is pretty good with bonus

Cons: Intense competition: The tech industry is highly competitive, and Microsoft is no exception. Employees may feel pressure to constantly perform at a high level to keep up. Large and bureaucratic: As a large corporation, Microsoft can sometimes feel bureaucratic, with layers of management and decision-making processes. Work-life balance: Some employees may find it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance due to the fast-paced nature of the tech industry.
Advice: None
Pros: Great compensation: Microsoft offers competitive salaries and benefits packages to its employees. Opportunities for growth and development: Microsoft encourages its employees to pursue their professional goals and provides various learning and development programs. Innovative culture: Microsoft is known for its innovative and forward-thinking culture, which fosters creativity and encourages employees to think outside the box. Impactful work: Many employees at Microsoft feel that their work has a significant impact on society and the world at large. Diverse and inclusive workplace: Microsoft prioritizes diversity and inclusion, providing a safe and welcoming environment for employees of all backgrounds.

Cons: Bureaucratic processes, lots of KPIs
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, good Work life balance

Cons: It's a very large company, so your mileage may vary. Every manager is different and your work may not have the impact you want. This is reconciled by the opportunity to move internally.
Advice: Keep up the regular town halls with the leadership team, and answer the harder questions when they come up.
Pros: Many people at Microsoft have been there for a long time. I anticipate doing the same because they value growth and learning. Mistakes are opportunities to learn, and everyone advocates to getting help sooner rather than later.

Cons: Some internal processes can be heavy and slow down your work.
Advice: Stay connected to the field and talk to your people
Pros: Great company, great technology stack with smart people with a strong collaborative mindset. A great place to grow!

Cons: - Pay is lower compared to other companies. - Too many inept middle managers throughout the company. - Senior management is completely out of touch. - Turn around time to accomplish anything is slow. Don't expect anything to be completed on time. - Many teams like to play the blame game and refuse to take responsibility for work assigned to them.
Advice: - Reduce the number of unnecessary middle managers. - Give engineers the resources they need to complete their projects on time. - Stop allowing certain teams to shift blame and work onto others. - Try harder to actually include people when if you're serious about diversity and inclusion. Right now, it's mostly a fad term that doesn't mean much outside of public presentations.
Pros: - Good benefits - Good work/life balance

Cons: Large organization, Changing Landscape and Cube lifestyle.
Advice: None
Pros: The Culture, Campus and Colleagues.

Cons: too focused on results instead of wellbeing within my team
Advice: None
Pros: overall company culture is great but not within my org

Cons: "Culture." This is a hot-button word leadership and sr. leadership like to tote around, but the reality is the shareholders heavily influence the culture and future of the org. The 10,000+ layoffs this year (2023) no or very limited raises this year "due to economic times" came as both a shock and a disappointment, as the organization has had a record-breaking year (again) and is looking to spend $69,000,000,000 in CASH for Activision/Blizzard. It does not seem to add up. "Diversity + Inclusion" is another hot-button word Microsoft likes to use, but the company only cares about diversity of color, not diversity of thought. DEI here just checks a box and feels more like pandering than actually doing anything of substance. Benefits - while the benefits are excellent here, they vary greatly per role. The company likes to talk about being "one Microsoft." Still, there is a huge disparity of benefits and rewards between retail/hourly workers and corporate Microsoft, also referred to as "greater" Microsoft. Corporate employees get higher stock/bonuses/rewards, have 3x the amount allotted for fitness reimbursement, and have higher tuition reimbursement than hourly workers (data centers, stores, digital sales reps, etc.). I understand there may be different rewards for perceived differences in value/ROI, but don't pretend to be "one Microsoft" if all is not equal. Paid time off - Microsoft used to have accrued time off based on length of service. This meant you earned your time off. However, the org recently moved to "unlimited discretionary time off (DTO)." On paper, this is great; at the discretion of your manager, there is no longer a cap on the amount of time you can take off. It also looks great on paper to say "unlimited time off." The issue is that it is discretionary. Instead of telling your manager when you would like to take time off based on your earned PTO, you now have to ask permission. Your manager is now free to tell you "no" if it does not align with the needs of the business.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft offers very generous benefits. The cost of medical, dental, vision, legal, AD&amp;D, and life insurance for a family of 3 was less than $80/month. Microsoft also offers 401K match, employee stock purchase program, tuition reimbursement, adoption reimbursement, and a fitness/health reimbursement. Pending your team and your manager, work/life balance and flexibility can fluctuate. In my case, we were "required" to be in the office one day/per week, but was not enforced. Other team leaders require you to badge into an office 1-3 times/week.

Cons: Not much downside here, maybe tech stack
Advice: None
Pros: Good engineers, wlb, pay good high stock growth

Cons: Large organization so moving up the ladder is more difficult

Cons: long working hours, politics, culture,
Advice: None
Pros: benefits, people, and work-life balance

Cons: I was first on a team that had no proper direction on what we would do. It was pure chaos. They would change the team's mission and reorg us multiple times. It was not like that on a different team after I made a switch. So choose carefully!

Cons: Corporate bureaucracy extends across roles that are reflected in the core business decisions.
Advice: Treat employees like assets rather than business expenses.
Pros: Industry leader of identifying and applying the latest technologies

Cons: On the downside, I felt that the company didn't always communicate clearly about changes in policies or procedures. There were a few times when I found out about new initiatives or changes through the grapevine instead of through official channels, which could be frustrating.
Advice: Provide opportunities for growth: Employees want to feel like they are growing and developing in their careers. Offer opportunities for training and development, and help employees set goals for their professional growth.
Pros: I worked at Azure for two years and overall, it was a positive experience. The company culture was great and everyone was friendly and supportive. The work environment was also very collaborative, which made it easy to work on projects with colleagues from different departments.

Cons: Very short-sided when it comes to customers Longterm needs. They are not a partner when it comes to working with SLG government.
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits package is great "0" cost healthcare

Cons: - Amy Hood has explicitly said they target 70% pay of the FAANG companies. They justified this by saying we have more stability and less WLB issues. Now we've laid off over 10,000 employees, we've been told by Satya to "do more with less", and we've had our bonuses eliminated despite hitting an all time stock high. Given the actions of our leadership, proceed with caution - Certain teams like Azure and Xbox have far worse work life balance than other teams. They can also be highly competitive, making a raise or promo difficult - Role expectations can be pretty rigid. Rather than management looking at your strengths, you are graded against a strict rubric. If you don't fit the mould, your career will suffer - Internal transfers are just as hard as external transfers, as you still have to do a full interview loop
Advice: - Cut the crazy politics. The teams are extremely vertical and too much time is wasted with people trying to figure out how to appease the person above them. Empower and trust the ICs to work with autonomy - Either pay like a FAANG company or expect worse performance than a FAANG company. You can't have it both ways - Handle layoffs with more tact. The rolling layoffs for 4 months that could hit at any time were incredibly disrespectful to every employee in the company. There's no reason you couldn't tell us how many of the 10,000 target had been laid off already, or pick certain days to do the layoffs so people didn't have to worry the next day. Other companies handled this with more dignity. Don't reinvent the wheel, just follow their lead.
Pros: - Relatively stable if you're on a team that turns high profits - Good Healthcare - Full remote is supported

Cons: Sometimes, the pace of change is slow.
Advice: None
Pros: I like working with really smart people.

Cons: Can be stressful, it feels like you shoulder a lot of work.
Advice: None
Pros: Very talented people, you will be better at your job during and after your time there.

Advice: None
Pros: good culture and work life balance

Cons: The work is endless in my opinion
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits are a plus and management depends on team

Cons: a big con was the org leadership - a culture of politics
Advice: None
Pros: the one pro was the benefits

Cons: Any customer-facing job can be exhausting.
Advice: None
Pros: Interesting tech and good compensation.

Cons: -Toxic management expects delivery at all costs -Maintenance and bug fixes aren’t valued, only KPIs -Career progression is almost entirely dependent on manager and what work they choose to give you. Creating impact outside of the scope of what your manager assigns you is seen as insubordination. -Low pay which is falling further behind the rest of the industry year after year -Incomprehensible quantities of technical debt created by sky high turnover and pressure from management to deliver KPIs quickly and then abandon them -chaotic on call rotations with little to no onboarding for new developers. Expect to be pages continuously for the entire duration of your rotation.
Advice: Stop bleeding engineers by increasing pay and giving engineers time to pay down the tech debt that has accumulated over the years. Microsoft’s culture of pushing a KPI out the door, claiming impact, and then abandoning it and moving to something else with no plan for ongoing maintenance is not sustainable. Stop treating engineers as disposable.
Pros: Intelligent coworkers, good brand, universal tech stack

Cons: There is a lot of process overhead
Advice: None
Pros: Get to work on technically challenging projects.

Cons: Constant re-orgs (minimum once per year), lack of leadership accountability, focus on the daily firedrill instead of focus on core strategy
Advice: None
Pros: Some of the best benefits in the industry, competitive pay, good people

Cons: Just as with any company, it is 100% dependent upon your manager, and their willingness to fight for you. If you get a bad manager, the odds of you being promoted is very low.
Advice: Managers who have been in the role for several years need to step back and look at the dynamics of the managers underneath them. Just because somebody has been there a long time does not make them a good candidate to be a people manager.
Pros: Microsoft is amazing places to work. With amazing people who are super talented.

Cons: Specific to MS products only
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and great culture

Smart People
Amazing Experience

Cons: Full remote work isn’t favored
Advice: None
Pros: High impact work
Focus on impact rather than busy work
Decent work life balance

Cons: Work life balance is non existent, so pay doesn't really scale, and vacation is a dream. Burn Out is a definite promise. Culture is unprofessional, managers are not managers, they lack professional training, and with that non ethical, hostile work environment, and bias towards ethicality.
Advice: You lost your one benefit, your winning culture, it will take decades to win it back. Sad to see all of the companies revenues leaving US and going to other economies.
Pros: Pay is great, vacation depends on your manager, since its not guaranteed, but unlimited if you have a good boss that favors you.

Pros: Great group of co-workers always ready to help.

Cons: long hours of work per day
Advice: None
Pros: nice environment and cool colleagues

Cons: Moved on because I had two terrible managers. They both didn't like new ideas and didn't value the prior experience I brought to the table. Word of advice, make sure you are 100% sure the level of the role before accepting. Managers will take advantage of experienced employees and align them to lower-level roles because of the prestige of working at Microsoft. They then wonder why these experienced employees are bored.
Advice: Do better! Be open to new ideas and ensure employees are aligned with the role and its impact based on the level.
Pros: Microsoft cares about their employees. The benefits are top notch and the work-life balance is phenomenal.

Cons: Nothing I can think of for now

Pros: Work balance life is great, you have the opportunity to work up to 100% from home, benefits are great for medical, mindfulness, etc

Cons: * Dropping employee numbers is now viewed as an easy way to meet earning expectations. * Employees over the age of 50 - beware!
Advice: None
Pros: Loved it when I first started in the 90's.

Cons: Mission, core values and leadership principles are well defined yet not followed by many leaders. I worked for a few poor leaders focused on themselves rather than employees. Words and action contradict. Discrimination is real and HR is about protecting the company not assisting the employee. Managers/leaders do not engage in real issues that need to be solved.

Pros: Work life balance is great

Cons: It's still a big company; they will throw you to the wolves without hesitation, regardless of tenure, skill, etc
Advice: Maybe don't allow rampant overhiring just to end up "empowering employees to find a new job" and blame it on a pandemic
Pros: Good W/L Balance Great benefits Lots of potential to work on impactful products Good growth opportunities Company culture generally pretty inclusive/feel-good

Cons: the standard operating procedure is to hire recent college graduates and have a seasoned person train them and then turn around and "layoff" the seasoned person - keeping the recent college graduate who has no experience. On top of this practice leadership is reducing benefits, salaries and bonus while the CEO received a 10% raise this fiscal AFTER laying off 12000 employees due to the economy.
Advice: hire people who are qualified to do the job not the cheapest you can find and treat them with the same level of respect that you expect

Advice: When you acquire a company, communicate better with them. Let people know that you’re looking to make changes. Notify those who are no longer needed from the acquisition earlier on so that they have the opportunity to look for other work within Microsoft. There were several people from my team that were let go that are highly competent and skilled, and could’ve been a benefit to your company. Many were let go not due to poor performance but because of a balance sheet.
Pros: Profitable, competent, strategic, great benefits, and perks

Cons: Career opportunities are there, however, it's important to voice your career goals to your manager early on
Advice: None

Cons: General uncertainty re job stability
Advice: None
Pros: Great training and opportunity to move around the company

Cons: Too woke. Trying to change my worldview instead of respecting my perspective. Racism in the workplace. Groups for minorities only, and activities that benefit and preferential treatment of people who identify a certain way is highly inappropriate. Integrity in the workplace is not honored. Manipulating clients to adopt ESG aligned behaviors by discounting prices.
Advice: Be real with your team. Remove the "snob" culture. Be accountable. Care authentically.

Pros: Both management coworkers do everything to help. In my 2 years of working as a full-time employee, I have grown in my professional and personal life thanks to my co-workers, including management who are also co-workers. Microsoft treats us as family, no as employees. The benefits are incredible and Microsoft always is looking for improvement.

Cons: Working in "the matrix" makes decision making slow. Lots of meetings. Lots of people that have to get on the same page. Lots of dependencies. Pace of reorgs can be draining. I've had a manager change every 9 months.
Advice: None
Pros: AI innovation has created tailwinds for the company. Work environment is fast-paced, collaborative and mainly focused on customer and business outcomes.

Cons: * As with most large companies, you’ll have limited upward visibility or mobility unless working on an important customer facing project. * Pay is lower than most big tech companies
Advice: Managers who are directly over the team should have a larger stake in understanding the work that is being done. Devs should not be writing their own stories, closing out their own stories, etc bc of a managers lack of understanding of what’s going on. Not asking for technical knowledge from managers, just the basics so valued conversations can be had.
Pros: * Stable work(for the most part) * Great benefits: 401k matching best in class along with healthcare * Job can be remote on team by team basis

Cons: The CEO has changed a lot for employee’s empathy. Since his tragic loss he’s checked out as a cultural leader. Other SLT’s are running the company into the ground, and the culture has so much become toxic.
Advice: Get empathy back for your front line employees, and start rebuilding your culture! Without a positive culture, your employees are dying.
Pros: Stock equity, health insurance, other benefits

Cons: I was told by Microsoft upper management that my team would not be affected by layoffs and then I was laid off 2 weeks later.
Advice: None
Pros: I loved my position at Microsoft. The managers seemed to really care about the employees. Even after I was laid off, my manager continued to contact me about how I was doing.

Cons: Hard to make progress with internal stakeholders Processes are confusing and complex Total comp less than other high profile tech companies Career progression is hard unless you have a high level sponsor

Pros: Good WLB in sales The blue badge opens doors with customers Access to all latest Microsoft tech Internal IT really good

Cons: Microsoft can sometimes be lower in compensation, but I believe they make up for it in their benefits, flexibility, and work life balance.
Advice: None
Pros: - Remote available - Flexible - Support learning and growing

Cons: Manager really makes it or breaks it. I'm not sure how all orgs are but mine defs isn't a healthy position to be in

Cons: Constant reorganizations can be a headache
Advice: None
Pros: Good tech to work on in Azure with some fantastic engineers

Cons: My time as an engineer at Microsoft was nothing short of disappointing and left me with an overall negative impression of the company. While it is undoubtedly a prestigious tech giant, my personal experience has been far from the ideal work environment I had hoped for. First and foremost, the work culture at Microsoft was incredibly toxic and cutthroat. Instead of fostering a collaborative atmosphere, there was a constant sense of competition among colleagues. This environment made it difficult to form meaningful working relationships and left me feeling isolated and unsupported. The excessive focus on meeting deadlines and achieving unrealistic targets often overshadowed the quality of work and employee well-being. Additionally, I was dismayed by the lack of recognition for hard work and dedication. Despite putting in long hours and going the extra mile to deliver results, I seldom received acknowledgment or appreciation from management. This lack of recognition left me feeling undervalued as an employee and significantly impacted my motivation. Furthermore, the technology and tools provided were outdated and cumbersome to work with. While Microsoft is known for its technological advancements, it was surprising to see that the engineering teams were often forced to work with subpar resources. This not only hindered our productivity but also made it challenging to keep up with competitors in the rapidly evolving tech industry.
Advice: None
Pros: I recently had the privilege of working as an engineer at Microsoft, and I must say, it has been an extraordinary experience that exceeded all my expectations. From the very beginning, I was thoroughly impressed by the company's commitment to innovation, its supportive work culture, and the plethora of opportunities for professional growth. One of the standout aspects of my time at Microsoft was the cutting-edge technology and projects I had the chance to be a part of. The company's dedication to pushing the boundaries of innovation was evident in every project, and as an engineer, it was both inspiring and motivating to work with such visionary teams. The resources and tools provided were state-of-the-art, which allowed us to develop solutions that had a real impact on the world.

Cons: Customers have a hard time seeing the value of Dynamics 365 and if you are lucky enough to sell something it might look like 1 -3 deals per quarter ( if that) . There are better CRM and ERP platforms out there, and ERP is an even harder solution to position to customers who have no current knowledge of D365 ERP.
Advice: expectations are unrealistic for sellers

Cons: No free food at all
Advice: None
Pros: Free drink and place to grow

Cons: . Recent layoffs across the company shocked many ppl. .Azure orgs have a steep learning curve because the systems are complex . Oncall and incident driven work may not be for everyone .Azure is quite complex to ramp up. Depending on your manager and the level you get hired, you may be expected to understand the systems in unreasonable time. This gets worse when Senior employees do not help well with ramp up or don't have good documentation available . Azure has lots of diferent orgs. So all I am saying here is team dependent. I dont know how it is in other orgs or teams across Microsoft. The quicker you ramp up, the easier the job becomes, the better your confidence and WLB
Advice: None

Pros: Best work life balance you can get

Cons: I didn't learn anything from my first team. The team wanted more of a Project Manager and didn't utilize any of my skills. When I switched teams, there was a huge difference. The work culture was great and they expected me to own a Product and make my own decisions. I think you use your interviews wisely to gauge the position.

Cons: Hard work but very rewarding
Advice: Interact with employees as much as possible
Pros: Great work environment, friendly people

Cons: Cuts last year don’t align with culture messages and create a lot of stress. New procedures are constantly changing yet scrutinized by leadership when “incorrectly “ applied

Pros: Benefits Variety of projects and products to choose from.

Cons: The firings of the last 9 months, coupled with senior leadership being tone deaf, is grating on everyone's nerves. Some folks are getting unhealthy with the stress. TONS more scrutiny on milestones in sales. People are exhausted.
Advice: Stop acting like we're broke. Give us travel money, to visit customers, so we can rebuild relationships which have frayed for 4 years during the pandemic. Other companies encourage travel and therefore win deals.
Pros: Good benefits in general, culture historically great. Status and reach in market.

Advice: None
Pros: Culture, Flexibility, teamwork, Diversification, workload

Cons: Toxic culture at the top that trickles down to the Field It is common knowledge that if you are a 50+ white male you will be passed over for internal roles and promotions I was used for interview fodder on multiple occasions (10+ times) before being laid off Microsoft is WOKE to the detriment of its employees and customer
Advice: I would clean house of all the WOKE Executive and HR Kool-Aid drinkers The culture of employee on employee competition leads to inefficiencies and when they are stack ranked (limited rewards that are given out with a slider bar managers have to use to model reward disbursement). Making your number is not enough, it comes down to "how you compared to your peers" and whether or not you are in a protected class.
Pros: Awesome pay and benefits plus you work with some very fine people

Pros: -great coworkers and good team culture -Decent WLB - work is interesting (at times)

Cons: The culture can be less than desirable. If you can read news headlines on weird stuff Microsoft pushes out, there are of course internal dilemmas and moral sidelining arguments everywhere. Also another company suffering from going "woke." And of course, recently, bonuses were revoked despite record profits.
Advice: None

Cons: Long hours, management needs more involvement and transparency with team members
Advice: better communication and involvement with team members
Pros: Great Pay, Awesome team members,

Cons: The hierarchy is incredibly vertical meaning that there are a ton of ranks you can climb and studios that have longer histories have a lot more people who are high ranking that dont actually contribute to the project and end up making poor choices or none at all. Many times they are hard to find or communicate with because they are either not in the office or theyre tucked away in unknown meetings. They'll use cool catchphrases like 'we're working towards a process that allows us to make decisions faster' but that meeting often lasts way too long. They roll out a new structure that everyone has to follow and it disrupts everyone. Rinse and repeat every quarter or so. It's pretty insane tbh.
Advice: Have more leaders who are also individual contributors. If you have more than 25% of your team leadership spending the entire week in meetings, they aren't actually in tune with whats going on in the trenches.
Pros: Compensation package and perks are amazing Plenty of work to do and ways to create value for the company Able to level up your career in multiple ways

Cons: tech bros live here. lot's of talk but not a lot of 'walk' when it comes to DEI. culture shift was great for the first few years of Satya, but now it's changed. Engineering teams are not diverse enough. PMs are undervalued. Too many politics and work overload.
Advice: figure out better ways to recognize folks and drive transparency around performance review and promotion tracks.
Pros: great benefits including $1500 extra in stay fit/wellness which also includes some kid's camp cost eligibility. tuition reimbursement, great learning platform, and amazingly talented workforce. it's a huge place, so lots of opportunities to move around.

Advice: None
Pros: stable job with good benefits

Cons: No real downsides, had to work hard but it felt rewarding.
Advice: Keep it up,
Pros: Flexible working hours and great job perks.

Cons: - A lot of corporate red tape
Advice: None
Pros: - Fantastic teams who work in collaboration - Great pay - World Class benefits - Amazing office - Control over career growth

Cons: The company culture can be artificial feeling, meaning that part of your compensation is tied to how good of an employee you are. That means that people tend say they'd love to help you as that would help demonstrate they are a good employee.
Advice: My immediate leadership was fantastic. Keep doing what you're doing.
Pros: Let's face it, prestige. In addition, the benefits are top notch, and the people in general are all professional and good at what they do.

Cons: Too much randomization in org structure.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance and allows hybrid option

Cons: From what I hear, not all organizations within MS are the same. I, however, have only seen one. In my org, we have a codebase that is truly unpleasant to work with. It is bad in every imaginable way, from size, to readability, to performance, to architecture. What makes this worse is the fact that engineers are expected to do the work of product and project managers as well as DevOps. That's in addition to our own work. Theoretically we have product people, but I've never seen them do anything useful except maybe some really high-level stuff. Everything that a PM does in any other company, your team is expected to do. You will see a lot of people who've been at MS for decades. They've not seen much else, or have seen it so long ago that they have no understanding of the current state of tech. And because they've been here for so long, they have a lot of weight. That's why that codebase is such a disaster and why it will remain a disaster despite constant efforts and initiatives to improve it. No architect is ever gonna say "I messed up, this is all bad, delete it" or "We decided to use tech X because it seemed cool, but we don't actually know how to use it, so we applied it in the same exact way as we know how to apply the old tech Y". And despite tech X actually being awesome, the team produced a monstrosity because all they know is tech Y and reading a couple of tutorials didn't help. To be fair, there are a lot of smart people here, who care about code quality, but the higher a person gets in rank, the more they care about looking important and covering their own behind. The company itself is gigantic and therefore a bureaucratic nightmare with proportional amounts of Kool-Aid being distributed. After the layoffs we are expected to "do more with less" (as if that wasn't already the case) and we won't get a cost-of-living pay increase this year because of "difficult economic situation and uncertainty". That was announced a few weeks after a record-breaking profits announcement. There is also an eternal corporate song in the air, about supporting the latest trend. At the moment it's diversity, inclusion, equity, social justice, etc. Obviously, the company doesn't actually care, none of them do, but it has to project an appearance or be eaten alive on Twitter. So just smile and wave and you'll be fine. Overall, it's just another large corporation. You can have an amazing experience, or you can have a terrible experience. It all depends purely on the org/team that you end up in/on.
Advice: None
Pros: Good teammates, depending on team. The salary is better than those of most startups. The stock is not just lottery tickets unlike most startups. Some great benefits, such as the ability to put additional $33K (instant Roth conversion) into your 401K after topping off your max annual contribution ($22.5K) and Microsoft's match ($10K).

Cons: - Microsoft is highly risk averse from a legal standpoint because they get sued so often with such a big target on their back, which often results in mandatory inefficiencies, overcomplication, and job frustration for the sake of strict compliance - Highly visible, publicly traded company that is constantly being criticized by investors and not immune to their pressure to influence business decisions towards short-term profitability staying in a double-digit growth rate in lieu of long-term gains; hence the massive, global 5% workforce layoff - Overly progressive and woke, at times, but the most reasonable of the big tech companies by far
Advice: Please keep those cons above in mind and don't be afraid to continue pushing back with your influence.
Pros: - Amazing &amp; fun culture - Transparent &amp; caring leadership - Career growth opportunity - Top of market compensation (or very close, if you include stock) - Benefits can't be beat - Financially well-positioned for long-term growth with such a diverse product portfolio - Realistic and effective DEI plan and approach

Cons: Overall ability for work to get done
Advice: Please listen to your workers more.
Pros: -good atmosphere
-Definitely a job you can like

Cons: Compared to its competitors, Microsoft consistently offers lower pay, particularly for business disciplines. Expect to make less than you would at Google, Amazon, or Meta, and potentially be given a lowball offer. Because of the focus on improving culture, it takes longer to become a people manager, which can be a con if that's important to you.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft is an all-around solid choice if you want to go into big tech. It has the prestige and respect to open doors throughout your career, and enough departments to ensure you're constantly growing in your discipline. Company culture and values are solid--and there's a real effort to improve, even if pockets of the old company (a place that was aggressive, Type A, competitive, and gate keep-y) still exist. I'm proud of the work we do and don't feel like I'm contributing to a worse-off world. Their commitment to leading the hybrid work conversation means remote work and hybrid schedules are accepted as normal.

Cons: Layoffs are rolling through every department.
Advice: None
Pros: Awesome company with great benefits.

Cons: As a company of 200k, I can only speak for the small piece I work in. There is a lot of disorganization and a lack of process. There is no real desire to fix it either. As a person new to role, it has been quite difficult to get up to speed. SO many materials, but lacking in focus and direction.
Advice: Enforce cultural values. Don't let people slip through the cracks. Ensure all members of the team are comfortable and have a clear and focused path.

Cons: It depends on the team you're working.
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits are best in the industry

Cons: Some of the cons of working with Microsoft include competition for advancement, 40-hour work week, isolation, not much variation. Teams can be complex and challenging to use effectively, particularly for users who are new to collaboration platforms. Cost considerations — While the Office 365 subscription is generally more cost effective for most businesses, it may not work for your business.
Advice: None
Pros: Some of the pros of working with Microsoft include a full range of health benefits, yearly allowance to pay for any out-of-pocket expenses that insurance does not cover, extensive benefits geared toward the physical, mental, and financial well-being of its employees. Microsoft also offers fun-filled activities at most of their sprawling offices globally.

Cons: pay is less compared to other companies
Advice: None
Pros: great culture and helpful people

Cons: None that I can think of.
Advice: None
Pros: The Pay, The benefits, The experience.

Cons: Artificially induced skillsets or projects to increase job security. Some seem to have a work more, think less approach. Although they are flexible with work/life balance on paper, it feels like it discouraged to utilize the benefit.
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible Work location &amp; hours, devotion to skill development in employees

Cons: Lack of inflation increase this last year
Advice: None
Pros: Maternity leave 5 month full pay

Cons: the pay is very low
Advice: None
Pros: work life balance is perfect

Cons: There was one guy they brought in to lead Production at the end of the project. He was the worst Manager I ever saw. He knew very little about Production and drove the team into the ground. $ichard
Advice: Continue to promote and train from within. It builds team moral and staying power.
Pros: Great onsite leadership in the beginning

Cons: It's hard to get ahold of the department you need for very important issues such as payroll.
Advice: Be more diligent in communication channels with all of your associates.
Pros: I love Microsoft they are absolutely the most difficult to understand, I see building for them as a challenge though. There is nothing I can't figure out after breaking it all the way down. Super excited to see where it goes in the future and the future of web3 and AI.

Cons: Lack of knowledge of consumers Lack of knowledge of markets outside of the US Lack of brand identity frameworks Sexiest practices and Head of MSFT HR is not people oriented Lack of training for men on how to manage women, women of color, and professionals from other countries.
Advice: Inclusive environments trump diversity. If Microsoft doesn't train their management on how to treat, trust, and develop diverse leaders, all your diverse talent will end up leaving. Don't block successful women because your teams need to check the box. Don't initiate investigations to listen to our voices if your management will end up retaliating against us and find any excuse to get rid of us. Increase your salary to L67 and L68 women leaders. As far as I could see, this level lacks women and non-alpha males, let alone, women of color.
Pros: Passion for their products Teamwork Very clever engineers

Cons: Pay is slightly lesser than FAANG
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is good

Cons: There are not cons with a good work life balance
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is very good

Cons: No cons, this place is great.
Advice: None
Pros: Great company and amazing people

Cons: Biggest drawback is that career growth is super slow and getting things done requires a large concerted effort across many teams, so things move slowly. This can sometimes drain energy and result in tedious work, rework, overlapping efforts, etc. Second issue is that at least currently, there is extremely limited mobility due to hiring slowdowns everywhere. Compensation is not the best compared to other big tech.
Advice: None
Pros: Overall it’s a fantastic company to work for. Great leadership team and company culture. Exciting and wide-ranging product areas and incredible opportunities to drive meaningful impact (especially recently with the leadership in AI).

Cons: Work can be poor or mediocre Old company, way too much politics
Advice: Focus on core engineering, don't always aim to be the follower
Pros: Established name Great benefits Some units, like Dev Engineering have great work for engineers

Cons: Large corporation making it harder to be visible
Advice: None
Pros: Benefits Work/Life Balance Career growth

Cons: Depends on the team and leadership
Advice: None
Pros: Culture and opportunity to learn

Cons: Seems a little too highly focused on stock price/shareholders - at the expense of employee compensation, retention, and overall satisfaction
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible work/life balance, good management

Cons: Toxic environment with lots of unqualified people safeguarding their jobs. Pay is average and they absolutely rob people of the equity they should have. They can get away with it because most Montanans are so content with decent pay. Greedy C-level
Advice: Incentivize employees with the life changing money that should be an opportunity for them at a company like onX
Pros: Being in MT is nice

Cons: They should stop laying people off
Advice: None
Pros: Good except for layoffs They are pretty old school in terms of design and everyone is a number

Cons: Mandatory trainings
Sheer size of the org creates difficulties
Acronyms/company jargon
Interview process
Advice: It may just be the business unit that I'm part of, but Microsoft has done a great job with creating a culture of psychological safety, positivity, and support. Everyone is willing to help, and I've never been afraid to ask a question. My team is dispersed across the US, but it doesn't feel that way due to Teams. Workplace felxibility is really nice and benefits are incredible.

Mandatory trainings can pile up quickly, and though I'm completely on board with certain initiatives, these are hammered in over and over and over via trainings, meetings, and overall company OKRs and not in a healthy way. The size of the org can create confusion when trying to get work done, or just to understand how the platform all pieces together. Acronyms need to be greatly reduced. When new you can't understand any sentence from anyone for the first month or so, and most employees end up making their own glossaries. Interview process was extremely drawn out, sometimes not hearing anything for weeks or more. 

I had worries about joining a company with 180k employees, but it's so much less corporate-red-tape feel than I exoected. Overall an amazing place to work, and the pros greatly outweight the cons. I plan to carry out the rest of my career here!
Pros: Company culture
Overall deal (pay, bonuses, benefits, culture, flexibility)

Cons: Awful work life balance sometimes
Advice: None
Pros: Great salary, social package and ability to work from home

Cons: Management often has no idea what we do or how to implement what we are asked to do. We are simply instructed to do it within certain limits with no understanding of what all can be done in a set amount of time.
Advice: Return the CSAM role to a technical role. Too many M1 Managers are former retail store managers/marketers and have little understanding of how cloud computing works. Also more and more CSAMs are being hired with no technical knowledge at all.
Pros: Great pay and support from colleagues

Cons: no cons no cons no cons

Pros: Nothing special. work life balance

Cons: if you are lucky to get into Corporate the skies the limit. if you work with the new Microsoft Digital retail Store be very careful. You are doing everything as if you are corporate which gets more pay and benefits, you are not! They have adopted a new Hybrid work environment however you are stuck with a Who you know not what you know situation. if you are good at being treated as a retail employee and not a Company employee. Unfortuatley you will be stuck with getting half the average pay for any roles for the Ft. Lauderdale/Miami region. be carful of who you talk to and befriend. You can be the best at what you do but if you are not a "yes" person they will black you out. I spent 7yrs with the company and when I had to take STD for a surgery i returned to have my role shifted and downgraded from Full-Time to part-Time with no cause or explanation. I company is great just try not to get involved with the Retail side of the company. They are very unorganized and play favoritism

Cons: New FY, politics and egos take over again at MS. Our project totally changed paths due to upper management politics.

Cons: You are valuable until you aren't. I worked there for +19 years and forgot towards the end that I was just a number. It isn't a bad thing necessarily just don't get lulled into that they "care" about you. They care about creating a great environment for you to do your best work so you can drive more impact at the company. They don't actually care about you as a person beyond what you can drive for them. This is a mirror reflection of the state of companies now. Find a company that works for you - it is just a day to day value exchange.
Advice: None
Pros: Good culture that believes and acts as if existing employees are its greatest asset. Lots of learning, training and growth opportunities for those motivated to pursue them. It is an opportunity to work with and learn from very smart, dedicated people.

Cons: Recent layoffs have hurt morale.
Advice: None
Pros: Team is always willing to help.

Cons: Role:
If you have never worked in consulting before, the Consulting Services department at Microsoft might throw you off. 
- You interview to get into the company then you have to interview to get on projects to even get work in consulting. (Not terrible but a little annoying)
- There are a lot of challenges for early career college hires in consulting. Most projects ask for well-seasoned X, Y, and Z technology experts. Which begs the age-old question "How will I get experience if no one gives me a chance to gain experience." It is possible to get on projects as a college hire but it can be discouraging at times. This role at this company definitely requires a go-getter mindset. The projects will not come to you, you have to go and find them.

Company:
Each department at Microsoft is like its own company which can create inconsistencies among employees and the messaging received.
Advice: Within consulting I think it would be valuable to focus more on the technical ramp-up of all employees of all levels rather than how consultants deliver.
Pros: Pros regarding Role:
- Role offered remote option
- Ability to learn many different technologies
- Constantly on different projects which can be good if you hate the idea of doing the same project for months
- Involves a mix of soft and technical skills as it is a customer-facing role

Pros regarding Company:
- Fantastic people that can offer mentorship
- Amazing benefits
- Options to move laterally within the company

Cons: No documentation or proper support for new engineers. The company has a culture of using "word of mouth" when engineers encounter issues (i.e. "Oh you're trying to understand this code, well no one knows how it works except John. He left the company 5 years ago but I'm sure you can still ask him about it")
Advice: Productivity would be tenfold if there was an internal investment in documenting how systems and packages work. I've probably encountered less than 5 readme files in the last year
Pros: Limited workload, don't have to do much

Cons: Large org, sometimes hard to get through red tape
Advice: None
Pros: Top notch talent with high paced atmosphere

Cons: compensation could be more competitive
Advice: None

Pros: healthy work culture, good work life balance

Cons: not much to con, great benefits
Advice: None
Pros: great benefits and travel reloc

Cons: Advancement faces competition due to a high concentration of talented employees and strict focus on controlling budget. Since 2020, isolation can be pretty bad, particularly for remote ICs who don't depend on others for their day-to-day (i.e. Software Engineers) or those in different locations. Lack of variety can be an issue, with work occasionally feeling repetitive or mundane. Internal politics and bureaucracy can sometimes be a major drain, causing massive churn and headaches for ICs just trying to do their job. Growing disconnect between frontline employees and executives this year following poor management of mass layoffs, creating an atmosphere of mistrust. Aggressive cost-cutting measures being effected this year, perceived as needless, have impacted employee compensation and benefits, further straining the relationship with executive leadership.
Advice: The influence of Satya Nadella's leadership on Microsoft has been unquestionably transformative and has mostly led to significant improvements in the company's performance and culture. However, it's concerning that there seems to be a shift in the level of respect and engagement with employees, particularly in light of the recent layoffs. The pride that Microsoft employees once held for their company appears to be waning. To foster an improved individual contributor (IC) experience, Microsoft leadership should consider the following: In times of truly necessary workforce adjustment, ensure transparent and compassionate handling of layoffs. This would alleviate anxiety and maintain the dignity and morale of all employees. No employee should ever be informed of their position being eliminated over a video call, which was my unfortunate experience. Continually enhance learning and career advancement opportunities. This includes fully funded travel for remote employees for morale or collaboration weeks. Address the advancement competition and budget constraints. Quarterly promotion cycles have improved the situation, but a more substantial promotion budget could help further. Efforts should be made to ensure that employees do not need to leave and return (boomerang) for advancement. Foster an environment that encourages creativity and variety in work, such as through job rotations, shadowing opportunities, or more project-based work. The Hackathons are an excellent initiative but extending such principles into daily work could be beneficial. Minimize internal politics and bureaucracy. Emphasize transparency, collaboration, and accountability, and reassess the necessity and effectiveness of multiple layers of middle management. Open and honest dialogue about these topics at all levels can lead to a healthier work environment.
Pros: Dramatic improvements to Engineering culture, as well as general organizational culture since Nadella took over as CEO. Provides competitive compensation and extensive benefits packages. Opportunities for learning and career advancement span across various domains and technologies. Demonstrates corporate social responsibility through substantial philanthropy and sustainability initiatives. Global presence leads to work on meaningful and challenging projects with substantial impact. Flexibility for global relocation available, coupled with strong immigration support.

Advice: None
Pros: Very cushy company with a nice benefit package that makes it a tough decision to leave

Cons: Lower level managers and supervisors obsessed with metrics instead of results. Especially any metrics which reflect on them. Many would rather make you do something a**-backwards because it looks good on a report.
Advice: Big organizations are difficult, because how do you assess employee performance without reducing everyone to metrics which can be gamed? I don't know, but giving employees more freedom to choose an approach will motivate them to come up with novel solutions and outside the box thinking. As things are everything is very 'top down'.
Pros: Many knowledgeable and hardworking collogues. Very friendly and professional.

Advice: None
Pros: Good managers, genuine people. Knowledge sharing environment. Step forward in the career. You will learn a great amount skills and grow as an engineer. Good culture, no micro management.

Cons: Not Hybrid or remote - While I understand the reasoning, the option for hybrid work is unmatched. Layoffs - At the moment - and of no fault of MS - we are in an economic uncertainty which has required them to make some difficult choices. This has everyone on edge with no knowing if they will have a position from day to day.
Advice: Continue to support your teams in the way that they need to be supported. Management is not only about delegating tasks, but also about the development of your team members.
Pros: Flexibility - The hours of work really allow for flexibility as long as deadlines are met. Benefits - Some of the best benefits in the market Culture - While I can't speak for every Org, my org truly had one of the best and most supportive cultures. My PM focused on personal and professional development and wellness during every conversation. Pay - Self explanatory.

Cons: Not sure if there's major cons
Advice: None
Pros: Good culture, learning resources, great benefit

Cons: Constantly in churn where no one knows what to do and how you do your job. If you aren't an "own it" type of person that needs to be told what to do, it is a rough onboarding process. Very little hand holding. Imposter syndrome is real, and in this environment you'll feel it.... and feel alone at times.
Advice: Too soon to say. My manager is awesome (I think he is an M2. We have no M1 currently.)
Pros: Tons of great people to partner with. Someone knows what you don't, and is willing to help. Benefits are amazing. Accommodations for disabilities, including ADHD/ND. Lots of support around mental health. Unlimited time off. Not micromanaged, and you can own your business and chart your ship.

Pros: Great environment and benefits. Great people and culture

Cons: This place drives anxiety and depression with its employees. Innovation is frowned upon unless you are one of a very few elite. Most people here are all about looking good instead of doing good. If you have a bad manager you're done. Find a new one asap. A good manager is better than a good role here.
Advice: I had a manager who wasn't comfortable with a direct report having big impact. These insecure middle managers are what's wrong with Microsoft. They stifle inclusivity, productivity, and innovation. I highly recommend devising an innovative model for management. Something like contributors getting to choose their manager without penalty. It might seem extreme, but the company would be much better for it.

Pros: Amazing benefits and Competitive salary.

Pros: Work balance is extremely well

Cons: Leadership that yells in meetings. High turnover rate on projects. Poor senior leadership accountability that leads to turnover. Constantly moving goal posts for project goals. Managers that throw people under the bus to protect themselves, lack of leadership accountability, continued promotion of the same people that have been working in the group for 8-12 years. Studio GM that doesn't understand games. Poorly staffed (understaffed projects). Poor work/life balance (generally 70+ hour weeks). Luckily I wasn't impacted, but layoffs are a constant fear that could severely impact your family and living.
Advice: Take accountability for your decisions. Don't expect external developers to eat the costs for you forgetting project agreements and changing design every 6 months. Don't tell your employees taking over mismanaged projects that they won't be blamed for them and then blame them. Stop the group culture of complaining loudly and throwing others under the bus.

Advice: None
Pros: not to much work for good pay

Cons: Grow is really depends on team
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance, good benefits and team event

Cons: The status quo is the status quo, not a lot of opportunity to go far with things, and you just may get cut from mass lay offs because you were just unlucky. Not the place I'd make a satisfying career, with management being a only them party, and the only way to make headway on any product is to get management to make it a task, elsewise it'll never get done, because there's no incentive to go the extra mile. It's a boring place, with amazing benefits, if that's what you want you can find it there.
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing pay, benefits package and wonderful coworkers.

Cons: Less impact due to size of the company
Advice: None
Pros: Massive company, huge network, great benefits

Cons: Refreshers vest over 5yrs Constant change in territory assignments Lot of cooks in the kitchen
Advice: Encourage a culture of ownership
Pros: DTO is great if you take advantage of it Relaxed WLB compared to competitors

Cons: WLB heavily depends on team, no raises for bs reasons in 2023
Advice: Give us the raise we deserve and stop pretending like you're getting less money this year when we have record profits
Pros: Good benefits, decent salary, decent WLB depending on your team.

Cons: You can kinda get lost in the work - overlooked sometimes. Recognition is kinda blah because there are SO many people working on something that it's hard to fully take credit.
Advice: None
Pros: Huge company with a global impact. Feel good type of work. See your work in everyday stuff.

Cons: Long hours &amp; not the best pay
Advice: None
Pros: Talented and very driven colleagues

Cons: My former manager was incompetent and not the right person to lead the team. Given the team was new to the org, the business expectations were unrealistic which made it difficult to meet or exceed sales goals. I, being one that excelled in previous sales roles, struggled in this role and made endless strides to improve. Instead of management assisting me in finding a better role, I was abruptly fired right after being told I received a raise. (Yes, this was all in the same conversation and no I cannot sue because I live in an "at will" state). I was told I am eligible for re-hire in other positions, yet I have been unsuccessful in pursuits to get back into the company.
Advice: Set realistic goals, create definitive roadmaps for those who wish to expand their careers, only hire sales mangers who have been sellers within the last 5-7 years.
Pros: Great pay, generous training curve, tuition reimbursement (among other great benefits), endless education, collaborative colleagues, etc.

Cons: Slow paced given complex tech stack and business
Advice: None
Pros: Great team and learning environment

Cons: Stingy with Benefits Inconsistent about remote work, not a lot of support for remote offices but also little investment in campus buildings.
Advice: Sort out remote work. We lag behind our peers in budgets for remote office supplies and budget, while also leaving our campus buildings functioning on half staff and reduced services.
Pros: Collaborative Culture Free soda Lots of opportunity

Cons: None that comes to mind.
Advice: None
Pros: Culture, people, innovation, growth mindset

Cons: There was a lot of pressure
Advice: None
Pros: Nice ppl worked at the comp

Cons: Terrible compensation package for hourly/administrative roles.
Advice: None
Pros: People, new culture/direction under Satya

Cons: Good work life balance depending on the manager
Advice: None
Pros: Some bad toxic managers are there

Cons: Typical big company motions. Slow move to change, difficult to move/get promoted internally. Senior leadership claims empathy but doesn't seem to care, very robotic e on addressing pay/layoff concerns despite being a constant issue during company polls.
Advice: Actually emphathize with your employees and offer better compensation.
Pros: Good benefits and training opportunities depending on which organization you work in. Lots of great low/middle management. Great work life balance

Cons: - micromanaging (depends on the person really) - sometimes you won't get support from your superiors - lots of cold calling and doing your own lead generation
Advice: None
Pros: - growth opportunity - job is enjoyable if you like sales (I just personally don't like sales) - team is great - physical location is great

Cons: - Layoffs have been rough, and we are not getting any merit increase this year. This has hurt morale a lot. There are a lot of people working hard and were looking forward to some sort of raise. - MSFT is a machine of a million gears, some bigger than others. You have to accept that you can only impact so many gears around you, and if you want to expand your network you have to make a concerted effort to do so. - There are always some people who make it through the cracks in hiring. Thankfully, I think that is less the case at MSFT, but still, it happens. I just wish we were more rigorous in some aspects of hiring, especially for non-technical roles.
Advice: Take care of your employees and reward them! We are doing great as a company and yet you think it's a good idea to take away merit increases in a year of high inflation? And announce this RIGHT after Signals survey ends? This is NOT how you reward performance and I thought MSFT was a "pay for performance" company.
Pros: - Great "deal" if you negotiate comp right. My team works very hard and is always engaged, but our manager makes sure we have adequate rest and recovery days and we load balance. - This is very subjective, but I've had great middle managers. They model, coach, and care and I'm very grateful to have such good immediate management here. - You work with brilliant people daily. For the most part, everyone here works hard and wants to help you out. Those who don't are real outliers and get spotted out quickly. You have to learn how to be a team player here. - The benefits are world-class. MSFT health care is the best I've had by far of all my employers.

Cons: Executive leadership has handled the layoffs extremely badly. Announcing layoffs rolled out at an unknown frequency over an extended period. Limited, sporadic communications. It's like water torture. Can only conclude that management no longer cares. Would have been better to do them all at once rather than letting them linger. Beyond toxic for morale. Lots of talk about empathy being a core value. And then the least empathetic thing possible.
Advice: Understand the long-term impact of your actions. Business conditions, even macroeconomic ones, are cyclical. At some point you will want to grow again but will have attrition of people you don't want to leave. And won't have internal referrals.
Pros: Good products and technologies. Decent benefits.

Cons: Work might not be as exciting as a startup, and you need to work your way into harder engineering projects
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, fantastic work culture that promotes growth. Very kind to their employees, and work is super motivating

Cons: Layoffs. If you're going to do them, don't make a one-time announcement that they will be recurring over the next n months. Better transparency of the job elimination process and criteria. Also, if I'm calculating correctly, my severance pay is an embarrassment. Especially given my tenure (18 years).
Advice: There has to be a more humane and effective way to handle the challenges precipitating layoffs. You're losing great talent and irreplaceable IP. There is no depth of knowledge in the areas I handled, leaving my former team in a position to risk failure, accuracy issues and delays.
Pros: Access to new Microsoft technology, autonomy, management support, exciting work, benefits

Cons: manager is not good. just know launch new projects, never consider fixing the exsited problems

Pros: The company is very diverse and does its best to maintain a healthy work environment. There are lots of company perks such as reimbursement for healthy purchases. They hit the best they can and it cultivated a culture of growth. Everyone is doing their best to be empathic to each order and our customers. At least in my team there’s a culture in maintaining clean code, we have book clubs and are not afraid to question code They allow hybrid and even remote work!

Cons: More responsibility should be given to every individual
Advice: None
Pros: Good company. Had a good environment of growth

Cons: Like at any company, some teams are better funded/ supported than others. Some teams are "startup-like" and those tend to be more chaotic and turbulent, with managers overworking people and coworkers throwing one another under the bus to show "impact". Microsoft is not immune to bureaucratic dysfunction.
Advice: Focus on growing &amp; retaining good management.
Pros: The benefits were fantastic, and most of the managers and coworkers I had there were some of the smartest, kindest people you could hope to work with. For the majority of my time at MS my work-life-balance was great. Internal mobility is usually frictionless (although recent economic conditions have certainly made opportunities more limited).

Cons: Hours can be continuous - 24/7, recent trends toward cost reduction.
Advice: Try to make the organization more flat if possible
Pros: Great benefits, interesting work, long-time MSFTies, literally endless opportunities

Cons: A lot of bureaucracy due to size.
Advice: None
Pros: Very good work like balance.

Cons: At this large of an organization you’re just a number to the SLT when it comes to layoffs regardless of performance or skill.
Advice: Employees deserve more proactive and honest communication from higher levels. More investment in teams below SLT.

Cons: Compensation is not great when compared to market.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft has great work life balance and a great company to work with.

Cons: As you go higher up in the company there are a lot of politics and egos to navigate. The company is quite siloed. The data can be a mess. The pressure and expectations are high. Long hours and loads of meetings aren't uncommon. Recent hiring freezes and mass layoffs. Lots of outsourcing and offshoring. Partner's are concerned about eroding incentives and conflicts of interest. Frustratingly complicated buying processes (too many products/agreement types, etc.) and poor customer service/support. Not very nimble.
Advice: None
Pros: Most of the people are amazing. They're smart, driven, diverse and inclusive, etc. The product portfolio is vast, some are market leaders others are newer/lesser known. Strong brand recognition, and one of the top players in the industry. Great senior leadership, with values and vision for the future. Above average total compensation.

Cons: Promos speed will depend a lot on which team you are in
Advice: None
Pros: Good learning oppotunities Great culture and people Flexible work schedules Nice WLB

Cons: Currently everything is pretty fine.
Advice: None
Pros: Provide a lot of opportunities to learn from each other and coworkers in the team share their experiences and skills every week

Cons: Limited career growth Culture getting more and more toxic
Advice: Some product needs good engineer and Microsoft is not creating a good environment to retain good employees.
Pros: WLB after I get familiar with company and product Package sits at 60%-70% among SWE For immigrant, day 1 green card

Cons: You have to seek out these opportunities, take control of your career path.

Pros: Regular training for compliance, but more importantly training to elevate my craft in sourcing and recruiting. We were encouraged to join outside groups and associations and we had a budget to do so for anyone on our team.

Cons: Cases can often be stressful, and customers are very demanding. Customer meetings easily can take an hour or so often I needed to multi-task or work overtime to catch up.
Advice: They only reach out if something is wrong. Managers only contact you if you're falling behind on SLA.
Pros: Most supportive, most professional group of engineers I've worked with. Company Culture allows you to learn and make mistakes. Every one of my fellow engineers really values learning.

Cons: A lot of projects move very slowly
Advice: None
Pros: Very good combination of products line

Cons: Career growth can sometimes get stagnated by less than interesting work that has more business impact.

Advice: None
Pros: good benefits and work/life balance.

Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Solid benefits, lots of projects

Cons: too many senior leaders who don’t positively contribute to projects or meetings. The best performers are not always the ones who get promoted. rather the ones who do get promoted are the ones who stick around long enough and who play into the office and team politics.
Advice: None
Pros: Nice perks, smart coworkers, decent campus

Cons: Remote workers are cut off from culture
Advice: None
Pros: Very family friendly and flexible

Cons: Can be slow and feel bloated, some people don't have much work to do.
Advice: None
Pros: Really good work life balance and supportive culture

Cons: Started at the company when I was really young at entry level. Leveling up internally is challenging. In most cases, there are only lateral moves if you get a new job internally. Annual reviews/promotions have to be fought for by a manager that is willing to speak up for you. On average it takes several years just to grow one level. Needs senior management and HR to review and approve two level jumps. External new hires are being hired into the company at market standard rates and levels and the internal employees are fighting to be level set at the ever changing market standards.
Advice: Some people should not be people managers just because that is the natural progression of their career.
Pros: Benefits were the main reason I stayed for so long.

Cons: It's a big company...you have to learn your way around.
Advice: None
Pros: I wake up and get to work with brilliant people every single day, internally and externally. What more could I want?

Cons: Culture is Terrible for Women. Executive Leaders say one thing but there is zero support for women in the field. If you speak up you will get blacklisted not supported. Too many biased process and yearly reviews are the worst. They aren't based on what you have actually done but instead on perception and usually by a manager that has not spent any time with you and is just going by whatever opinion the salesperson has of you.
Advice: Start actually supporting diversity and inclusion instead of just talking about it all the time.

Advice: Unfortunately, there is still secular pockets of politics, that are frustrating to navigate for ideation
Pros: -Positioning itself for future success correctly and competitively -Work Life Balance is secular but tends to be much better than most competitors. -The people and what you can learn from them ... they make this company great period

Pros: Top notch benefits. Good work balance

Cons: nothing I can think about
Advice: None
Pros: the team was really great

Cons: The work itself is tedious and not very interesting. Easy to get bored if you’re not a self starter who can find ways to make the work interesting. Almost have to be a hammer in search of a nail to not be bored. No real room for career growth.
Advice: Need a refreshed approach to hill strategy; current strategies are antiquated. Need some fresh blood at upper management in gov relations.
Pros: Great salary and benefits, autonomy to do the job. Nobody is going to hold your hand and nobody is going to micromanage you. Very much trusted and expected to contribute to the team and get the job done as a team.

Cons: Work life balance iis too great. Want to do some more work. No work = slow promotion
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance is great.

Cons: There are pockets of top-down pressure, lack of work life balance at times, but the most serious &amp; consistent con has to be the compensation. It seems like the company would rather pay 2x your CTC and hire a person with lesser experience than pay you more and bring up to market standards. With this attitude, Msft will keep losing the talented &amp; intelligent folks :( The process of awarding SSAs and other benefits is extremely opaque and doesn't seem directly correlated to the business impact you had in the preceding years (but on some very vague events from long back in the past)
Advice: Care for your existing employees' compensation. They are super talented people. Instead of hiring someone with lesser experience by paying double the price (as you need to match the competing salary), increase it for the existing employees. People aren't stupid. They get to know the data points and the intelligent people will leave over time (once they overcome the intertia of a switch) if this continues. Using the "Microsoft deal" as an excuse will not work. You could replace the person, but you can't replace their experience. Value loyal employees who are performing.
Pros: The scale of the systems here is massive and the breadth of teams across the company is very good if you want to explore internally. Met some very intelligent folks (unfortunately they left over time) and learnt a lot. Became a better professional and human in general. Company actually values diversity and inclusion and usually, you have the flexibility of work hours and leaves.

Cons: Very big time commitment and hard to rise
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture and earring potential

Cons: Slow career growth, Low rewards/Total Comp for Early in Career
Advice: Make sure you are rewarding people based on worth. A SWE 2 with years of experience at the company is worth significantly more than a new hire out of college. The pay and rewards should reflect that
Pros: Amazing benefits (401K match, ESPP, Medical), Great company culture, Beautiful campus

Advice: None
Pros: WLB is good and no toxic culture

Cons: Nothing i can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Really good with good perks like 401k

Cons: Typical big organizational issues and sometimes the work load can be a lot but only happens at certain times throughout the year.
Advice: Continue to challenge the status quo and create more moments to hold the mirror in front of people leaders faces to help with their growth and development. Managers can be the very thing that derails all of the company great progress because of their fixed mindset.
Pros: Company with great focus and great people. Leaders are fun and enjoying to work with.

Cons: Compensation on the lower end
Advice: None
Pros: Very accommodating and lets you work at your own pace.

Pros: The people and culture are the highlights.

Cons: terrible stock comp plan what a joke
Advice: None
Pros: brilliant leadership responsible managers ridiculous benefits

Cons: Work in my current team is not engaging. Worked on multiple projects that end up not going anywhere. Seems like a lot of work is being done just for the sake of showing impact.
Advice: None
Pros: Perks, Benefits and Salary is great.

Cons: Sometimes the DEI programs are creating biases in treating employees fairly across the board. It is unfortunate because many people representing minorities are very talented and we don't do a favor to them when we create ad-hoc promotions and/or different treatments. Environments can be extremely political when you touch upon these arguments and there is clearly a disparity of treatment if some concern arises.
Advice: It is a great company with further fantastic potential. Last year's raise was nothing compared to the competition. The problem is about the stock refreshers. Add at least 50% more refresher packages for people to align with the industry and you will retain people for a very long time and coach your leadership to treat people "EQUALLY" based on impact and competencies. All the rest is awesome.
Pros: The company culture changed dramatically since Satya took the leadership in a good way. Opportunities to learn are infinite and the company can accelerate when it is needed. Overall people are nice and humble, right environment to grow.

Cons: Time pressure environment Lots of work

Cons: None that I can think of.
Advice: None
Pros: Good work-life balance in the organization.

Cons: Hard to maintain work life balance
Advice: None

Cons: Cutting edge work and technology with often difficult leaders.
Advice: None
Pros: Interesting work often challenging bosses

Cons: Does still push many DNI initiatives on employees - undermining merit and reinforcing discrimination on in the office on the basis of race and gender.
Advice: Please evaluate my performance not my race and gender - makes me feel like less of an individual.
Pros: Company treats employees with respect and fair compensation. Employees are encouraged to bring their whole self-regardless of their political views - which is really impressive and allows for a more balanced culture.

Cons: No dedicated verification and validation team. This was pushed on the the software devs Laid off people in droves in while company made profits. Doesn't matter if you worked couple years or 10 years for the company, no one is safe from layoffs.
Advice: Allow unions to form such that employees can have greater control over their careers at Microsoft.
Pros: Good pay Good work/life balance most of the time Smart people Immediate team and direct manager super nice

Cons: nothing that I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: great colleague, mentors, and environment

Cons: Constant layoffs are bad for morale
Advice: None
Pros: Culture used to exist there, opportunities to move across fields.

Cons: If you are unlucky to report to a manager who doesn't care about your career growth or follow Microsoft's evaluation tools, no one is holding them accountable. This means that you can be without career evaluation for years. The issue is that the tooling (Connect) is used to apply internally so if like me your manager is simply uninvested, they render you non-competitive. My best option was to apply outside of Microsoft to reach seniority. The other issue is diversity. While I see the value everywhere. As a woman, it wasn't fun to be the only one in the room as I was the only woman in my team. I think Microsoft is overselling diversity to attract talent but there is no real plan after that especially for diverse candidates with manger who are not invested. Lastly HR was not helpful or supportive in addressing the issue besides dismissing my concerns and sending me back to my manager. And so was the leadership team.
Advice: Make managers more accountable. Support diverse candidates per the promises made on the website and during interviews.
Pros: Benefits are great. Perks are great too.

Cons: Due to the size of company, junior employees may feel that the scope of their work is narrow.
Advice: None

Pros: Great culture and lots of opportunities for growth within the company

Cons: Some teams have legacy tech stack
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits, career growth opportunities

Cons: too slow, slow promotion, devs are slow.
Advice: None
Pros: overall good, a tech company

Cons: Zero, and I mean ZERO, structure around career growth. People spend years at MS being under-leveled with no path to promotion, and completely subjective decisions because managers are overpowered in this department and actual impact has no effect on their decisions - it's a popularity contest, so if you're not you managers favorite, you're never getting promoted. It's relatively easy to move around to try and correct that but it can also set you back YEARS because your new team doesn't really care about the blood you spilled on the last product.

Managers are just the best IC in the room and have zero actual management skills along with training that just requires them to FF a video and show no proof of competency. This is the biggest issue with Microsoft, they don't hire people that are good managers to be managers - being the best programmer or designer has NOTHING to do with being a good manager and they simply don't get that.
Advice: Don't be a manager if you have no empathy, or actual desire to elevate your reports. Don't take credit for the work of your reports, their success already makes YOU look good, taking credit for their contributions makes you look like a jerk.
Pros: Microsoft takes great care of their people, the benefits are some of the best in tech, you can take pretty much all the PTO you want regardless of what you're actually rewarded, the annual perks are really great and the bonus structure is generally pretty great without requiring you to boast or dump on your peers.

Cons: As a designer, Microsoft is still very much an engineering led company.
Advice: None
Pros: Company has a great work life balance.

Cons: Lower pay compared to big tech
Advice: None
Pros: Good work life balance and benefits

Advice: Train your managers to communicate directly and honestly.
Pros: Work with highly talented engineers. Good benefits, work life balance.

Cons: Microsoft is a very engineering lead company. PMs design and designers are not given the same value as engineers. Things are done backwards of building for a technology rather than building for user needs. Leaders are just doing whatever's best for their next promotion, not what's best for the team. Too many reorgs too often.
Advice: None
Pros: Worked with some really smart and great people, and Satya was doing his best to improve the culture (which was better than I expected when I started.) Culture was good, if you were on the right team (but bad on others) Microsoft is really about the team you're on, not the company in general.

Cons: Politics is to much, yo need to dedicate a lot of time to it if you want to develop your career

Cons: If you are in the wrong team, politics politics politics.
Advice: None
Pros: If you are in the right team, great collaboration, interesting product, ability to have impact.

Cons: Some teams are fantastic, some teams are toxic. Nepotism is a problem. Management actions do not align with company values. Work/life balance does not exist. Some CVPs schedule late night and early morning meetings, this sets a standard for their teams and no boundaries are set. Workload is unrealistic.
Advice: Follow company values, they are more than just words. Treat your admins like a member of your team, a strategic business partner. Your admin makes sure you have bathroom breaks and blocks time for you to spend time with your family. Your admin likely spends more time caring for you than they do for themselves. Please don’t dismiss your admin, be an advocate and support the role.
Pros: Competitive pay, really great benefits, potential for promotion, it’s Microsoft.

Cons: Despite eberything, most orgs still run slow.
Advice: None
Pros: A good learning ground, especially in the current environment.

Cons: I don't have anything to offer at this time.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft is one of the best companies to work for. Everyone is incredibly collaborative, and has amazing benefits.

Cons: External hires are given higher levels and compensation compared to internal promotion just to be competitive and that effects people being motivated and attrition. Senior level hires are not vetted for the new MSFT culture (especially MSFT rehires) leading to bad cultural behaviors creeping back. Over emphasis on diversity making it next to impossible for internal mid-senior level folks to move around
Advice: Partners and above need to be vetted/screened by the team they are leading to ensure that MS cultural attributes are seen from a 360 lens (especially for rehires) Make it easier for folks to move around for other positions rather than making it difficult due to diversity push. Like make the job available internal folks for some period before posting externally)
Pros: Great culture does not over hire to layoff later (layoff is very limited due to business changes) thinks about being relevant long term rather than short term bets Good compensation and WLB

Cons: Layoffs, constantly adapting without giving time to build foundation

Cons: Not enough good people. Would like more good people

Pros: Pretty good tobgood. Some good people

Advice: Continue to increase diversity in senior management
Pros: I've been fortunate enough to have a great manager and senior managers. The primary pro is the pay and benefits. The work life schedule flexibility. I can schedule my own hours and not be micromanaged. As long as I get my work done.

Cons: Over hired during Covid and now going through massive rolling layoffs. Companies like Microsoft have so much money and made an obscene amount during the pandemic. Due to poor forecasting from leadership, teams of people are let go. Doesn’t matter if you’re a rockstar performer. In the end you’re just a number. Also, for such a massive respected company they are a mess. Siloed and bureaucratic. This was once my dream company to work for but in reality it was probably one of the worst.
Advice: Stop laying people off to line the pockets of the board members. How much money is enough?!
Pros: Benefits are great. Unlimited time off. Remote friendly.

Pros: It really depends on your direct manager, I liked mine so I was lucky.

Cons: Toxic culture. Too much internal competition, people are resources and replaceable.
Advice: Look into how mid management is treating the smaller orgs.
Pros: There are a few, but focusing on cons for now

Cons: If you actually care about software engineer and creating cool stuff, don't come here. Everything moves at a painful crawl and the engineering standards are non-existent. I will never have imposter syndrome again after seeing how bad the engineering is at one of the biggest tech companies.

Cons: HR is not transparent, they just laid off people even though there was a business need.
Advice: Put people first and fire the guy who cannot even answer a question when telling someone they will lose their job. If you make profits, but then dissolve an entire department without any warning it's not a good look, especially when that department has been forging new relationships for the company.
Pros: Great place to work, with many resources and benefits, the people one works with are really great

Advice: None
Pros: Your job experience will be completely team dependent. The company is known to hire well rounded, skilled individuals who thrive as mentors.

Cons: Zero Training for a new hire admin. You have to hope that someone will show you the ropes. *Not all people treat admins well; you will need a boss that supports you when you get treated poorly. Ask HR is not helpful at all. You will never get a helpful answer.
Advice: Put a training doc together for admins. Where and how to access expense tools, where to find space maps, where to find the Org charts, how to use a Distro list, information about Purchase Ordering, where are the Cost Centers and IO's kept, what's the spending limit on an Amex card, where can you NOT use an Amex card. Where and how to use Employee Central, and how does one get permission to work on behalf of X boss? These are massive roadblocks and just a few examples.

Cons: None at the moment from me
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits, have great team members and manager, and work life balance

Cons: The interview process for externals is ridiculous. It took me a year from my first interview with zero interim communication until a finals day. I accepted another job and worked someplace else for 10 months before the second round of interviews even began. Internal hiring is equally abysmal, with little to no opportunity for internal movement due to various quota requirements. M1's are literally unable to help you at all. They have no power except forwarding your complaints or concerns to someone who doesn't care to listen--by which time you are persona non grata for not toeing the company line. The work schedule can be grueling, especially if you support multiple timezones. You have to defend your time off and refuse to justify it. During every round of layoffs, you have no idea where you rank. As someone who has had multiple published works, shipping products, involved in community leadership, nominated multiple times for Gold and Platinum club (internal awards), speaking engagements on behalf of MS, highest possible evaluations in Connects (internal review process), and internal mentoring, not to mention years in sales exceeding quotas by 100% or more, I would have thought that I would be valued or given the opportunity to move to a new role. Your contributions aren't valued more than you most recent 1:1 with your manager. Don't spend your life laboring for an organization that does not recognize or reward for sacrifice or above-and-beyond work.
Advice: Transparency. Since leaving, I have had a steady stream of former coworkers contacting me on that are perpetually living in fear of not knowing the criteria for layoffs/reductions, what they can do to protect themselves, or if it's truly random. It's a deathly toxic environment, leading to loss of productivity. Everyone is watching Blind for the latest worrisome news instead of contributing to the bottom line. You need grief counselors for day-to-day employees.
Pros: - Access to some of the latest tools in the marketplace - Great peer networking - Easy to find technical help when you're stuck

Cons: hard to switch career paths and not clear guidance for career growth
Advice: None

It was insulting.
Advice: None

Cons: It is sometimes difficult to see what your path forward in the organization is because it's so vast, but that vastness also encourages me to really think about the type of work I want to do, the teams that I want to be involved in and pursue those.
Advice: None
Pros: The "deal" is incredible from salary to benefits to stocks and bonuses. The opportunity to work with really intelligent business professionals had me dealing with a bit of imposter syndrome at first but it encourages you to shift gears and step up your game and understand that you're just as capable.

Pros: Compensation Benefits Work life balance DE&amp;I engagement

Cons: MS talks a lot about great Leaders, internally and to the outside world, about their core priorities to “model, coach, care”. Unfortunately, that wasn’t my experience! Without a leader who truly cares about your growth and success, is the beginning of what can make or break you here. Joining MS is a huge challenge. Without the proper onboarding and leadership support, you can sink quickly. MS is a Tech giant, so this doesn’t apply to all leaders. There are some great leaders there. Just something to pay close attention to as you start your journey.
Advice: None
Pros: Excellent Benefits &amp; Perks Great learning and bonding with Team members Products/Solutions are top notch Nice variation of Employee Resource Groups to join for support

Cons: Big tech is imploding and job loss is inevitable.
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of challenges and great teammates.

Cons: Promotion velocity is slow, and the pay is not super competitive.
Advice: Focus on retaining current talent. I see a lot of people leaving post-pandemic. The company seems to have the attitude to not care about people who are "not loyal to Microsoft". But not everyone who leaves is disloyal.
Pros: Microsoft feels like a company which is interested in your growth. Managers are trained about helping you achieve more, how to get you projects that you're interested in. And there is enough diversity of work / businesses within the company, that you don't have to leave to switch disciplines.

Cons: Total package of compensation was not competive.
Advice: None
Pros: Great vision, did the right things in cloud and AI.

Cons: I'm not a current nor or former employee
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft is a company that

Cons: I was laid off after 11 months at Microsoft along with other 30 people. I just woke up and lost my job in one day because of a business decision. I chose this career, it is what is is, it comes at a risk.
Advice: I hope they work more closely with engineers and would give advice and warnings if possible. I did not have any sign from my manager. There was nothing I or my manager can change to secure my job.
Pros: Great people, amazing team. You will get help when you ask for it. Lots of opportunities to learn. Lots of benefits and perk+ was really nice.

Pros: people, work, balance, process, perks

Cons: Pay is mediocre, career growth is slow.
Advice: None
Pros: WFB is good, tech area is interesting.

Cons: *Work life balance is pretty bad. They pay me 60% more than my previous job, but they make me work nearly 80-100% more. Working 10-12 hrs a day is normal. Deadlines are too aggressive. *Not a fan of the way layoffs are being handled currentl. Veterans who hve spent 20 years in the company are getting locked out of PCs abruptly. But then again, that seems to be the norm these days with all major organizations.
Advice: Stop creating artificial pressures on your teams by making up unrealistic targets and deadlines. It burns them out.
Pros: *Smart helpful co-workers *great benefits, though less compensation compared to peers Google and Amazon. *Good projects and wide array of teams to move internally

Cons: None that could be seen

Advice: None
Pros: Good work Life Balance and benefits except salary

Cons: nothing really, it was just time
Advice: None
Pros: Very enriching and a comfortable environment

Cons: There’s a reason Microsoft invented Teams to replace flights in the first place. Flying halfway around the world for a one-hour meeting is a huge waste of time and resources – nearly 1 in 3 business travelers find it difficult to stay on top of their workload when traveling. Polling in Europe has shown around 3 in 4 business workers think recent air travel restrictions had no effect or a positive effect on productivity. Frequent business travel has been linked to burnout – nearly a quarter of business travelers say they have to work more to make up for lost time while traveling. Business flights can especially lead to added stress for single parents, who have to find childcare for their kids. This is something Microsoft should be especially worried about given its own research recently found 41% of the global workforce is considering leaving their employer this year.
Advice: I implore management at Microsoft to advocate for more intracompany meetings to take place via Teams. This will help the climate crisis while making your directs much happier campers.
Pros: As someone who worked in Global HR at Microsoft, I have seen the amount of travel that Microsoft employees do; so much of it is unnecessary. Microsoft invented Teams in part so that people don't need to travel by air for business so often. Microsoft already knows flights are terrible for the climate – that’s why it’s been offsetting its flights and investing in sustainable jet fuels. But offsets are deeply flawed and sustainable aviation fuels are so expensive that the airline industry has consistently failed to meet its own targets for sustainable fuel use over the decades. If Microsoft wants to be a real climate leader, it must scrap all but the most necessary flights from its travel policy.

Cons: Slow paced Lot of senior people in one team
Advice: None
Pros: Great work life balance here Great company

Cons: Undergoing some destructive leadership changes and reorganizing. Some of the passion has been lost.
Advice: Changing too many things at one time without proper change management is causing more chaos than should be expected from such a market leading company. Satya's vision is sound as is his company culture, but new leadership scrapping what worked and trying to do things from scratch without consideration for institutional knowledge and what works in a company like Microsoft, is causing the troops to lose faith and commitment.
Pros: Great vision and value to the world as a whole. Breadth of products and capabilities

Cons: No mobility or upward trajectory Repetitive and no plans to reduce burn out
Advice: None
Pros: Awesome Company, Benefits, Pay, Perks, Training, People

Cons: Things can move really slow and lots of maintenance work
Advice: None
Pros: Company offers great benefits to employees

Cons: You're trading work life balance for salary. Keep that in mind as you negotiate in. Once in getting hired locally anywhere other than another hyperscaler is difficult. They just assume you are unaffordable. I've been told that repeatedly.
Advice: N/A its a good gig.
Pros: I'll say it in simple words: Positive environment Fast paced A lot to do A lot of career opportunity inside of the company Demanding challenging Team spirit Microsoft Give

Pros: Benefits like Perks, health insurance and DTO

Cons: Salary is low, we need more pay
Advice: None
Pros: Best culture and vibe, cool projects

Cons: Too many layers of management that lack vision and direction. No one is held accountable for their areas which cause very broad and ambiguous roles. Can get exhausting trying to chase people down to get things done. Scope is very small and limited, I see no room for growth in my role. Management and leadership is very poor and I sense a lot of age-ism and favoritism.
Advice: Identify and drive clarity on vision and direction for your team. Create and build relationships with partner orgs and hold each other accountable. Make sure that middle managers are executing on the vision and managing their team properly.
Pros: Great benefits, work-life balance, can really grow and expand your network here

Cons: N/a nice snacks in the office… not it you’re gluten free
Advice: None
Pros: Very happy here love it

Cons: limited growth, corporate nepotism is real
Advice: not likely
Pros: WLB is good because there is little accountability to actually work

Cons: Massive problems with discrimination and no accountability from HR. Racism, sexism, harrasment you name it. Also, low pay compared to competition. A lot of coddling of golden boys. Many men don't do any work and keep being rewarded. Senior management makes a lot of questionable decisions and their word is final. Promotion and reward cycle is very slow and unfair.
Advice: None

Cons: Employee morale is at an all time role. Heavily, heavily monitored hourly/daily movement tracked. Excessive, heavy handed oversight of day to day progress.
Advice: I don't know that there is an opportunity to contribute. Suggestions are not well received and/are often condoned. Implied gratitude (To the employee's) from above mgmt. is usually the response.
Pros: Wonderful benefits made available, work/life balance

Cons: very big company and hard to stand out
Advice: None
Pros: great tech and work life balance

Cons: no merit increase yet more and more work. MSFT support also somehow is getting worse every day which results in ruined relationships with us

Cons: Working at MS was very stressful. I developed stress-induced medical issues and had to quit. My org was explicitly told they weren't allowed to hire any more white or asian men, only women and/or black/hispanic.
Advice: If you truly value diversity, you wouldn't be pushing out men, whites &amp; asians, and conservatives. You're trading one narrow view for another.
Pros: Salary was good, my team was talented.

Cons: Agro / me-first / self-promotion required to keep your job or advancement

Cons: Company is making record profits but treating employees worse every year
Advice: None
Pros: Cloud work is leading edge Talented coworkers

Cons: Culture wars rage - latest layoffs targeted employees who made their leaders uncomfortable. No more vacation, vacation is now at the discretion of managers - if they don't want you to take off, you can't
Advice: shed VP's who have been in the same role more than 10 years - just doing that would have given MSFT more cash back than all the other layoffs.
Pros: Technically adept Internal product usage is great Free gitHub

Cons: Very hectic and huge workload
Advice: None
Pros: Best in the business no doubt

Cons: Some people aren’t so productive.
Advice: None
Pros: Some smart engineers. Good wlb. Flexible in terms of remote work.

Cons: The work itself can be quite mundane and boring. Not a lot of fast paced or greenfield projects. You'll find yourself providing support to an existing product so developing new features will be low on your team's priority list. The teams are structured top down so as a junior employee, you'll find yourself being given work that the senior engineers don't want to do. The pay is also quite poor compared to other FAANG companies.
Advice: Prioritize the growth of junior employees if you want to get rid of the 'retirement home' reputation. Get rid of unnecessary product managers and engineering managers since they typically provide no value.
Pros: The best work life balance you'll probably find among FAANG companies. Everyone is easy going and the work environment is quite relaxed. Some of the nicest coworkers I've had the pleasure to work with. Great benefits such as Employee Purchase Stock Plan, great 401k matching, 1.2k per year fitness stipend, free public transportation card, amazing health insurance, etc.

Cons: Work can be sometimes to much.
Advice: None
Pros: The work was easy to balance.

Cons: Upper level management is in constant turmoil and didn't understand what ux was for. Did a lot of powerpoint cleanup and business evaluation. Internal billing system is a nightmare and I spent a lot of time on admin. Internal promotions were rare and raises were hard to argue for.
Advice: None
Pros: Direct management was really great, the work wasn't intense and the work/life balance was actually pretty decent. Benefits were extensive. Work was largely self-driven. Got to work on some cutting edge projects

Cons: -Hard to negotiate meaningful comp increases, even when you are clearly providing value that justifies it -Corporate life isn't for everyone -While I respect their initiatives to drive equality and inclusiveness, I often felt like I was at a professional disadvantage as a white male
Advice: None
Pros: -Working with brilliant people -Microsoft really does seem to care about the well-being of their employees. -With a few exceptions during stressful times, the work/life balance was great

Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits and structure is good

Cons: Lots of travel can be a grind
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of opportunity for exposure and partner engagement.

Cons: 0 Work-life balance. Managers are always after KPIs and often fail to acknowledge the burden front-line engineers face with. Middle management especially M1s in technical support is the weakest area for Microsoft. They get comfortable in their roles and lack empathy. They don't advance their skills and try to get themselves familiar with what their team is supporting so it's hard to communicate with them and make them understand what we are trying to accomplish as a team.
Advice: None
Pros: Everyone is so talented and hard-working. Microsoft encourages a growth mindset and commits to making its employees grow along with the company.

Cons: Work life balance is a challenge
Advice: None
Pros: Great company and smart people

Cons: - Environment too lax - Too rainy
Advice: None
Pros: - Smart people to work with

Cons: Nothing that I know of
Advice: None
Pros: Good culture, support and work culture

Cons: It is a typical corporate environment
Advice: None
Pros: The benefits are better than most

Cons: - Little to no process to truly hold managers who engage in bully behavior accountable.
- Lack of effective coordination among teams in same business units.
- Perf review process (“Connect”) has become either a checkmark (do it for sake of doing it) towards a carrot or too easily used as a stick by managers who have created hostile working environments. These type of managers also often control the ability for targeted employees to change roles (by crafting a narrative of why other teams shouldn’t hire that team member).
Advice: An increasing number of managers at Microsoft have created a hostile working environment by bully behavior (shared on social media and my knowing of several such managers) . Escalating to HR isn’t an option unless there’s also a formal class discrimination at play; otherwise, there’s no accountability for hostile tactics (often including narcissistic behavior - lying, gaslighting, etc.).  This should and must be addressed as it’s become a systemic issue that will eventually limit the ability to attract world-class talent.
Pros: - Benefits (best in corporate world)
- Flexible (work arrangements from home and hours)
- Interesting work (if in right role on right team)

Cons: They could lay you off at any time
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and great work life balance

Cons: Non-transparent layoff procedures. Not awesome.
Advice: Layoffs of the little people are hardly ever the solution (beyond the optics show it puts on for share holders). You efficiency comes directly from your middle management. Get those folks in shape and you see double productivity.
Pros: My team was the best. My manager was to die for. I can only hope my next role has such a great group surrounding it.

Cons: too many layers, hard to get things done quickly
Advice: None
Pros: good compensation, co workers, customers

Cons: Rapid change keeps you on toes
Advice: None
Pros: Awesome place to work, great culture

Cons: Too fast paced and changing priority
Advice: None
Pros: Great company, growth and reward

Cons: Products span across many engineering teams. Agile (self-organized) framework means that you need to re-establish processes for every new investment. Slow to take fresh ideas due to conflicts with LT plans. Product usability is incredibly poor with low traction on solving.
Advice: None
Pros: Core priority is diversity and inclusion. Values accessibility. Products span global markets including federal government. Flexible work schedule. Hybrid working locations (including 100% remote). Plentiful perks and bonusing opportunities.

Cons: Middle Management needs more work to become better culture stewards and leaders. Leadership needs to be more than managing teams of people and doing individual contributor work.
Advice: Middle manager roles need a revamp. The focus of these roles needs to become one of more stewardship with a focus on engaging a team of individuals to meet/exceed designated goals with both honest and open communication, interest in each team member, an open mind, while using innovation to increase impact at all levels.
Pros: Focus on growth mindset and learning. Direction from Senior Leadership Team. Continued focus on employee feedback process.

Cons: typical of all large companies
Advice: None
Pros: stability pay team work (depends on product move within the company

Cons: no raises, seems to move at slow pace

Cons: No réal career dev Incompetence of some managers
Advice: None
Pros: Worklife balance Good income Training

Cons: No specific cons noted in my experience
Advice: Maintain the balance of qualitative and quantitative skill assessment and in-depth real-world examples of specific challenges/problem to be solved.
Pros: I met with a panel of technical architects and had a mix of behavioral and technical questions. Each panelist allowed for questions, which opened up the door to hear multiple perspectives from a diverse group of practitioners in the same or similar role. There was a focus on qualitative vs quantitative experience and the discussions were based on questions like 'Tell me a time when you helped solve a major technical challenge for a client." and "Explain how you influenced the team dynamic when leading a cross-functional team." Good and challenging technical questions about architecting modern solutions on a cloud-first stack. Deep technical questions on Msft development languages and .Net framework.

Cons: Lack of leadership and overall direction for how the company needs to change in order to meet its objectives. Company does not live its values.
Advice: The stated company culture focuses on a growth mindset, but in reality what I experienced was a closed mindset especially from more veteran team members that had been in Microsoft for a while. I would highly encourage leadership to get more active in eliciting different points of view especially from your team members and then wholeheartedly endorsing changes which align with the companies stated objectives for Change and growth.
Pros: Pay and benefits are fantastic.

Cons: MSFT is a very large company .
Advice: Keep up great work
Pros: People, products, customer, culture, career

Cons: The review process is truly dreadful
Advice: None

Cons: Wlb, looming layoffs, no raise this year while senior leadership team is raking millions. Since AI is the new thing, they want to implement AI everywhere

Cons: nothing except bureaucracy and difficulty at getting a raise
Advice: None
Pros: goo working conditions and good pay

Cons: the team culture can vary from team to team since the company is so big
Advice: None
Pros: great benefits, really aims to take care of their employees

Cons: Instead of having dedicated SREs/devops teams, MSFT engineers tend to have to do oncall rotations themselves. Which is painful, because we have teams and outages on the other side of the world. Ie right when you're trying to sleep. I've been woken up countless times for petty issues.

Lower pay than FAANG/MANGA.

Slow career progression. It's more about years of experience than actual contributions. It's much easier to get a promotion by switching companies, and I imagine the pay increase at that new company would be much better than what MSFT gives you.

High-stress. I quit halfway through 2021 and I am still recovering from burnout from a gaslighting, rude manager.

Most of the people I worked with were disrespectful, petty, and standoffish. This is common across MSFT, even though I have seen a lot of feedback here saying MSFT is a wonderful place to work. The meme picture of Microsoft's org chart, where different teams are aiming pistols at each other, is painfully accurate. It is true that change has happened under Satya Nadella's leadership, but MSFT still lives under a rock compared to other companies today. I don't ever see this changing.
Advice: None
Pros: IMO, this company has great development tools. For example, Azure DevOps, which bundles most if not all of the typical dev flow, CI/CD, and artifact repos in one tool.

Offices are bright and have good ergonomic setups, including the desk, chair, and PC equipment.

Cons: Upper management is heavy ex- intel all over the stack that itself maybe not a bad thing however seems nepotism is at play 
People non intel getting sidelined at upper management as observed from bottom
Long time Microsoft employees are leaving in mass for one or other reason
New Hires are not the cream of the crop so only time will tell
Need to play some level of politics even at IC level to grow, might be the case in other similar size companies so take with grain of salt .
TC still lower than other top industries
Advice: Instead of just org growth and heavily filling up top with ex intel colleagues please focus of efficiency and let engineer be and make decisions and ownership of their work .  Too many meetings for far too less work . Meetings are being conducted only to give sense of people involvement than actual necessity . And many times meetings conducted without people who actually will do the work .

Heavily invested in technical infrastructure 
TC got boosted

Cons: It's a gigantic organization, and the messaging coming down from management is not always clear.

Cons: I happen to have a terrible manager. In addition to being awful at management, leadership, planning, organization, communication, and defining roles and responsibilities, they constantly undermine, insult, and yell at team members.
Advice: Cultivate and maintain constant channels of anonymous feedback with people two and three levels below you. Three are some mechanisms for anonymous feedback at Microsoft, but only reporting to HR is available on-demand. The other mechanisms are restricted to two time-constrained periods a year. These existing mechanisms also make it difficult to provide feedback on your skip-level manager, even if you work as closely with them as you do your direct manager.

At least three quarters of my skip-level manager's organization is very unhappy with their poor management and with my manager's vicious behavior. As far as I know, none of us have reported this to my skip-level manager's manager. This suggests that employees are skeptical of the mechanisms for providing feedback and fearful of retaliation.

- Not feeling of appreciation - they let you know you are just a number for them and they can replace you tomorrow
Many come here hearing all of these great stories about culture and support and come to find out it's different here. 
- No one cares about you - you are on your own and responsible for your own happiness for most it just doesn't fee right and can be very very depressing 
- People who have been here for a while are degraded typically and you won't find a common grounds with them which becomes difficult to work

Cons: - Depending on the team, as with most large companies, there can be quite a few politics involved in promotions and project distribution + lifecycles - Diversity and Inclusion initiatives can feel fairly shallow and more for press than true culture change - Before lay-offs, it was known to be pretty hard to get fired at Microsoft, because of this there are some dinosaurs sticking around that slow down social and technical progress

Pros: Looks good on your resume.

Cons: Work life balance is horrid if you are on dri. I have never seen in 12 years of programming a manager treat an employee so bad that they went on FMLA for depression. Don't get on the bad side of your manager. Every manager seems to be fake nice. They will stick you in an open office environment with a bunch of PM's.

Advice: None
Pros: Good label - You get microsoft tag on your resume.

Crowded. Noisy environments. Growing pains that lasted too long.

- Don't leave your affordable city to live in expensive Seattle, your pay "increase" will result in negative flow.
- Plan on spending 25% of your wake time looking for new roles. Annual re-orgs can mean you are out on a whim without any warning. 
- There are many other companies that pay a lot better than Microsoft
Advice: - Take some responsibility for your employees careers. The curve performance review approach is harmful when you have to force good people into the lower ratings because you have to comply with the model. 
- Walk the talk of "human centric" and "Empathy"
Pros: - Wide range of opportunities
- Large boutique of interesting technologies in the "One Platform" which means more opportunities and breadth of what's possible versus other companies that excel in one or two lines of technologies.
- Size and global presence.

Cons: Expectations are high. If you are highly skilled, they ask too much. Much more than the job calls for. Then when you are not able to get it all done, it is a drag on your ability to succeed. I have also had some not so good managers.
Advice: When you cut expenses/budgets while also increasing requirements for individuals it is not only not fair, it is wrong.

Pros: Fast-paced Great benefits Travel Good salary potential

Cons: Highly political Only bullies advance in their careers No work life balance Cut throat No inclusiveness Discrimination Terrible pay Taking time off feels like punishment when you go back to work Narcissists everywhere

Pros: looks good on your resume if you survive the toxicity and bullying of Microsoft culture you can thrive anywhere

Cons: I genuinely have zero cons.
Advice: None
Pros: Can't speak highly enough about my experience here. My team was amazing, leadership went above and beyond to make sure teams felt heard and seen. The culture is the best I've ever experienced.

Cons: No real cons from my experience
Advice: Make discussions around career development and growth a constant in your relationship with direct reports. If someone voices they have no interest, but not many are proactively working on developing their career.

Cons: Hierarchy, politics, nepotism and horrible often toxic management (lots of ICs promoted into management with no experience) with a very limited number of exceptions. Too many distractions around culture, not enough focus on product or innovation.
Advice: Hire competent, experienced HR people from outside the company, not outsourced or 20+ years at MS. Performance management system and managing out culture is terrible as are recruiting screeners and the onboarding system (or complete lack thereof) Pay market rates. Break up the OG cliques and bring in more industry hires. Long time MS staff (10+ years) are generally out of date with skills and tools. Raise the hiring bar.

Advice: None
Pros: Meaningful work. Good work-life balance.

Cons: There simply aren't many. We re-org a lot, but I both understand the need and I also am quite tolerant of the pivots. If that's hard for you, it may be the one thing that will be undesirable.
Advice: When re-orgs happen, explain the underlying motivations in more detail. Otherwise, keep nurturing such a positive, inclusive, supportive culture that makes us feel empowered.
Pros: Microsoft's focus on Diversity and Inclusion is stellar. Satya Nadella has instilled a "One Microsoft" Culture that's truly working. We're all expected to leverage the works of others and to contribute to the efforts of others. I love the spirit of collaboration .

We are truly inventing the future and solving some of the toughest software challenges on the planet. 

Most of my career, I had few good things to say about Microsoft or its products and that has definitely changed in the past 7 years since Satya has taken the helm. I'm now a true believe and genuinely am pro-Microsoft in every respect. 

It's also easy to move from group to group as your career goals change and as you respond to re-orgs. There is a sense of "as long as you stay at Microsoft" our main goal is your career success in such changes in roles. 

Microsoft is also one of the best technology companies I've seen regarding nurturing your career goals. There's a real sense of nurturing our talent.

No company is perfect, but Microsoft is darn close.

Cons: Can't seem to hold on to good talent. Base pay is lower than what I was paid in the past but bonus and stock is better.
Advice: Local management could be more transparent. No one knows when someone leaves or get promoted.
Pros: ASIC design is still relatively new to Microsoft. There is a lot of opportunity to share your industry experience. As processes mature I'm sure those opportunities be fewer. There seems to be lots of opportunity for mobility too. Benefits are nice and in-line with that of most tech companies. Not being at the headquarters, there are still very nice facilities and events.

Cons: Cultivating an environment where you feel comfortable to fail and learn from your failures over strictly making sure to meet your deadlines
Advice: None

Cons: Seem often to be following/copying rather than leading, layoffs could've been avoided or reduced
Advice: Consider what laying off 11K employees does to your reputation.
Pros: Smart people, great infrastructure and resources, good benefits

Cons: It's easy to feel like just a number, and like you don't have total control over your career.
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Great atmosphere, great people, everything good

Cons: Work-life balance can be rough if you're a software engineer in certain orgs. Most engineers I met were forced into participating in on-call support rotations. When you're on-call, be prepared to skip most travel or any event where you can't reach a laptop to be online to respond within 10 minutes. 

We were told by management that, in order to meet our requirements, we should avoid going to movies, sporting events, and to avoid areas where cell service wasn't consistent, and anywhere that we couldn't get internet service quickly. Be ready to skip workout classes, school events, long walks, or even scenarios where you may potentially get stuck in traffic. 

These on-call shifts may last for a few hours/day up to an entire week at a time depending on your team's rotation policy. There is no real compensation for work done during on-call shifts or for being on call. Your manager may give you some flexibility in your working hours to compensate.

Some upper managers are really into doublespeak and cognitive dissonance. When multiple teams were laid off to move headcount to sites in other countries (without reasoning given), the VP of the org bragged of record growth and profits while simultaneously telling everyone that they need to tighten up and work harder because they were now inexplicably short-staffed.
Advice: Be realistic about work-life balance and look at staffing levels and on-call policies.

Pros: Great Company to work for and grow in your role and seek expanding opportunities. Wonderful Benefits and Culture.

Cons: - very hard to get new technologies to market: no skill muscle, no appetite other than acquisitions that are still born, and no protection
- very 'woke' workplace culture - too woke and massively passive aggressive because no one can really talk about anything
- the business is designed to build value to current franchises: windows, office, xbox, and azure. Almost no ability to innovate outside of these areas. Either get into one of them, or get out.
- almost all career opportunities are shut out by 'lifers' that are waiting their turn in line
- hr runs the show and everyone is afraid of them
Advice: there are always 'two speeds' of a business and should have two different systems in place for this.

1) the stable core with incremental innovation is working well. 

2) new innovative technologies.  Your HR, channels, systems are designed to 'snuff out' anything new.

This soft handling can impair some products and create a really undesirable sub culture within that group.
Advice: None

Cons: Training is uncoordinated and haphazard
Advice: Have new management shadow other managers before giving them a team to take over.

Cons: strict and static schedule at there.
Advice: None
Pros: Good Teams and development environment

Cons: Too much bureaucracy, not so great engineering systems
Advice: Senior management needs to be more transparent with employees. It looks like they don't value their talent because we have to go through the whole set of interviews for an internal move, it looks like they prefer to hire new people than to keep their employees.
Pros: Good salary, great work-life balance, great perks.

Cons: I've not observed anything yet
Advice: Nothing yet
Pros: Great Tech , Work Life Balance.

Cons: Zero job security. The layoff is managed randomly throughout the quarter without clear criteria across the company.
Advice: Should SLTs at the company also get laid off themselves? #1: you managed the business poorly, which caused over hiring across the company. Pandemic stock price uptick and pandemic demand surge will end as the pandemic will end. Whoever deicide to add significant headcount during pandemic should be accountable for this mess.
Pros: Not much I can see now.

Cons: High expectations to deliver. May be competitive
Advice: None

Advice: Focus on promoting those who are trying to have an impact on the customer experience, not just to manage people.
Pros: Pay and benefits are all great. Work from home is also always an option.

Cons: Almost half a century of high-tech history and past reputation to contend with, even with recent (and major) shifts in culture and approach to markets.

Advice: None
Pros: Some of the best moments of my life were at company events

Cons: Company size too big + lower pay compared with other big techs
Advice: None
Pros: Big name + good location + good benefit

Cons: The cons are mostly centered around the fast growth experienced in the last couple of years with very little time to ramp new employees and gain the experience needed to operate in a complex environment.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft is a very collaborative and people centric organization. Great effort is being made to foster creativity, allow diversity and operate with very high business ethics. The company overall is very well managed.

Cons: Salary &amp; stock for devoted/preforming/long time employees increases very slowly. Salary and annual stock comparatively to alike companies is on the lower side even as stock price largely increases. Unfortunately, in order to level-up/increase salary many leave and comeback to the company. Lastly, "and I am female" to be blunt, if you are heterosexual and caucasian odds of promotion and/or hire are against you in this period with the company.
Advice: D&amp;I is at an all-time high within the company, if you're within their "D" scope your chances for hire and/or promotion are very high right now.  The D&amp;I rating below is due to the company's current imbalance of their initiative specific to the D, which is causing issues that previously did not existed as performance-based merit has lost footing.  The "I" within company culture is extremely positive and promotes free ideation whether there is failure or success. This Inclusiveness is driving very positive creative thinking.  My advice to senior management is to eliminate measuring and basing manager merit/bonuses on their "D' portfolio and what you're selectively offering and not offering for your team/employees.
Pros: Life balance/mental health/family and employee development are very well measured and maintained as top company values. Culture within the company for it's size is great. Over-all a good company to work for.

Cons: Do massive layoffs every two to three years.
Advice: None

Cons: depending on the organization, RTO maybe enforced
Advice: None
Pros: great culture and leadership across the company

Cons: Growth can be slow/gradual, which is not uncommon for large companies.
Advice: The sudden layoffs when the market seems to be okay, seem like a warning sign that management isn't staying true to its claim to care for employees.
Pros: Good opportunities for growth Amazing manager Support and encouragement to do your best Amazing benefits Great people

Cons: Restricted on the future development - IT centralized roles.
Advice: None
Pros: Great culture, people, and benefits.

Cons: - Perpetually understaffed - Legacy management styles have not been fully weeded out Really varies from team to team.
Advice: 
Pros: - Great people - Many great products - Amazing benefits

Cons: Recruiter not transparent in hiring process. I was not informed that my office would be 20+ miles from downtown Chicago. Members of the DSS organization do not receive the same benefits as other Microsoft employees. This distinction is also not made apparent in hiring process.
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits including 401K matching. The people on my team are great colleagues!

Cons: There are many snakes that are so sensitive to their agenda you can't be yourself, and definitely can't joke around, in fear of offending someone.
Advice: If someone is mildly offended, tell them to go work it out with the other person and not run off to HR, unless it's serious, as most of the time it's a misunderstanding.
Pros: Most of the people are amazing and the benefits are incredible.

Cons: I dont have cons in my mind
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft as always, one of the best tech company in the world. I love it so much!

Cons: There is A LOT of backstabbing and drama in this workplace. If you are in a lower rank, like below level 60, you will never be able to be promoted to a higher ranking job. They have to use their promotional salary to promote a low-level person but will never take away compensation from their higher level rockstars. Admins also no longer receive stock.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft has an abundance of diversity, great managers and teams, and competitive salaries.

Cons: The work is kind of boring and slow
Advice: None
Pros: Friendly coworkers and community. Good work life balance. Full benefits.

Cons: The salary and bonus levels have always been “middle of the road” compared to their peers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. It’s not uncommon to hear of friends getting what feels like jaw-dropping signing bonuses and base salaries and to then feel one’s loyalty is un- or under-appreciated.

Those who have been there a long time may also discover the salaries of new-hires are often “biting at their heels.” It’s seldom rewarding to realize that kid who just joined straight out of college is making ~70% of the same base pay as someone who has given 15-20 years to the company.

In short, work here for the love of innovating technology with legends in the field, amazing people, building awesome products and solutions, and great benefits — not because you want to win a salary measuring contest.
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft is an amazingly supportive place to work. They are constantly learning, constantly bettering themselves, and constantly delivering immense value for their customers. 

Culturally and technically, they’ve come a long way under Satya’s leadership and have truly become one of the best places to work for technologists if top salary / compensation is not a top concern.

Pros: It was wonderful! Culture and pay.

Cons: low pay, sometimes very stressful, stupid people everywhere
Advice: None
Pros: work life balance, good manager

Cons: can be bureaucratic work life balance talked about but not always a priority learning to say no and keep focus on highest priorities is key
Advice: There were always way too many "must dos" at any given point and never enough devs to do them. Planning exercises never had enough buffer for critical bugs and customer escalations (or space for engineering to simplify/modernize/fix so there were less bugs to disrupt planned work). A lot of time was spent talking about quality and reducing regressions, but it needed meaningful action/resourcing to become more than just talk.
Pros: many different groups and domains to work in great resume builder nearly everyone is passionate and motivated

Cons: The specific role as a DSR(digital sales) is best fit for someone who thoroughly enjoys sales. If you don't, you're gonna have a hard time. Also it's really hard to move up if you navigated from retail regardless of if you have a degree or if you may be qualified for the role you're applying to.
Advice: None
Pros: Company culture, ERG's, initiatives support, benefits are all A1

Advice: None
Pros: Opportunities for impact on product

Cons: I have yet to find any cons.
Advice: Keep doing what you are doing.
Pros: I've been a consultant for several decades now and never knew a company like this existed. Microsoft seriously takes care of their employees, they don't just pay lip service to it. They also take care of their customers. As a consultant at Microsoft, it is made clear to me that the customer is the priority and that their privacy is sacrosanct. And that if you advise a customer to use a competitor's product, you will not get in trouble so long as it is in the customer's best interest. 
After consulting to many of the Fortune 100 companies, and seeing how many of them "say" that the customer is a top priority and then see that it is only so long as they can make a buck off the customer, well it is so nice to find a company that means it.
The management is great. The company really does place the employee's work life balance first and your family comes first.
Employees are urged to collaborate and find ways to make your coworkers successful which creates a very healthy, team oriented environment.
Benefits and healthcare are beyond belief.

Cons: Managers often determine if or how much you can achieve in that team
Advice: None
Pros: Lots of teams to choose from based on your personal interest and career design

Cons: Like with any successful large compnay, they run lean and mean, so there is a steep learning curve and you have to be extremely flexible in adapting to changes
Advice: None
Pros: Great Culture, phenomenal benefits, and tons of growth potential

Cons: Still have some sacred cows from the previous era that are very difficult to work with; sometimes if you do not have a computer science or engineering degree, may feel like a second-class citizen when talking with engineering teams
Advice: None
Pros: Create learning opportunities, management committed to personal growth, good working environment and culture.

Cons: Lots of overhead sometimes when collaborating with other teams
Advice: None
Pros: Get to work on projects with large impact

Cons: Hard KPIs are very narrow for the CSM Modern Work position. They don't count anything but usage of the workload. Any other accomplishments are not counted other than the hard KPIs.
Advice: Digital transformation isn't a hard KPI workload count. Start counting hard and soft KPIs towards digital culture transformation, CxO alliance building for digital transformation, positioning as trusted advisor, etc. This would have an effect that the customer journey towards digital transformation turns Microsoft in to a trusted advisor. Not only counting sale and usage, but as a partner moving forward to be leaned on. In the Venn diagram of customer and Microsoft, the KPIs only count the overlap. What's in the interest of Microsoft and then the customer. In that order... I left because I couldn't bring holistic digital transformation to customers. The only thing that counted was the KPIs for that workload. My talent was to create a mind-set shift at the CxO level to initiate culture and technology transformation. This takes time to trickle down to a KPI usage count. Changing peoples habits takes time and isn't a quarter, half year or fiscal year endeavor. I can appreciate that this isn't how Microsoft wants to operate due to shareholder interests and accountability. Just the nature of the beast I guess. On the other side, there are other businesses where a trusted advisor position, and strategic leadership advising are needed. Bit of a brain drain for MS. I throughly enjoyed and appreciate the culture and leadership for my decade at Microsoft. Thank you!
Pros: Wonderful place to work and learn. Look for a great manager! I always looked for great managers to work under and had an amazing time there for a decade. If you're looking for a real place to hone your skills, this is one of the best. The culture is wonderful, it's demanding but very supporting. I bring many fond memories with me.

Cons: No cons. Good co experience
Advice: Listen to your workforce often
Pros: Constant learning and growth opportunities

Cons: below average salary and poor management
Advice: None
Pros: good technologies and flexibility and good employee treatment

Cons: Like many others, reported record profits, even through the pandemic, but it took 2 years for pay adjustment when moving roles and when it finally happened, it was low in comparison to similar roles in other companies. Often felt like greater Microsoft did not value my coworkers and I in this specific role.
Advice: For months, my coworkers and I addressed concerns about our current compensation. It was insulting when we were finally offered such a low adjustment. You lose a lot of great, hard-working employees when they are valued so little
Pros: Great work environment, solid work/life balance, lots of career opportunities, great benefits

Cons: internal processes challenging, hard to understand revenue and target attainment, lots of red tape and bureaucracy.
Advice: None

Pros: Working with world class engineers on cutting edge technologies with networks spanning the globe

Cons: There is still favoritism across the board when it comes to promoting people and that should be more data and fact driven.
Advice: Be truly invested in people's careers and take the time to listen to expertise and background from people that have been in certain company domains for a long time
Pros: Microsoft has made incredible strides around culture and while it's still not perfect progress is palpable in many areas of the company even through the large company size. Regarding benefits...wow, this company cares about people's lives and the impact the company has on society in a way that no other company does

Advice: Performance reviews at MS have always been highly subjective; according to reports from friends who are current employees, they still are. Instead, reward and promote employees based on objective, measurable accomplishments compared against measurable annual commitments.
Pros: Smart people, interesting technology, fun projects

Cons: Less pay compared to FAANG

Pros: Great benefits, good pay, bonuses are great

Cons: Culture is becoming toxic toward older adults, and there doesn't seem to be the will to address certain types of culture toxicity. There is an idea of what diversity is, and honestly, the idea can become very austere toward certain demographics. This is sometimes expressed even publicly inside of microsoft.

Cons: No complaints that I can think of
Advice: None
Pros: Great team, good remote work and WLB

Cons: Quota is built off of and driven by algorithms that are clearly not mature. Company does not care enough to adjust. Also moving around within the company sounds theoretically great, but unless your classed in the "D&amp;I" group, you'll struggle waiting for a role to open.
Advice: Dont rely 100% on machine learning when building sales quota. Your actively driving top performers away and loosing the strong talent that can actually hold C-suite conversations. Also compensation is now lacking compared to many of our eco-system partners.
Pros: Great immediate leadership, great opportunity if your a member of the D&amp;I group, you'll be given top preference to almost anything you'd like to pursue.

Cons: No cons that I can think of
Advice: No advice for management at this time.
Pros: Great environment with like minded co-workers. Made for a great working space.

Cons: Lots of bureaucracy and layers of management, slowing the process of getting things done quickly and efficiently.

Cons: I wouln'd really say there are any major cons
Advice: None
Pros: amazing benefits, truly feels like family working for microsoft

Cons: Resource Utilization, Implementation Timeline, PTOs
Advice: None
Pros: Work Culture, Management, Learning, Creativity Exploration, Perks

Cons: Large corporation and you can get lost. Need to perform at your top or it can be reflected in your performance review. Too many groups and red tape can be a limitation. Not much face time with leadership given the size of the organization.
Advice: Keeping the employee in mind has been key for me to value this company so much. It is not only about grinding but also growing and it is appreciated by the employees. Bringing remote employees to HQ for face time is always valuable. Good job.
Pros: I joined about a year ago and I've had a great experience. Cares for employee development. Not counting nickels all the time but investing in growth. Open to employees location preference (since the pandemic). Top facilities. Free beverages. Great food available at a reasonable price on site. Communication from management.

Advice: People... treat people
Pros: Some Pretty Nice Benefits Cool Office A Nice Hoodie

Cons: too many levels are involved in the hierarchy.

Advice: Think about the future of the project, instead of making decisions on day to day basis.
Pros: Excellent Company with great workplace environment. Plenty of opportunities to grow

Advice: None
Pros: One of the biggest pros of working for Microsoft is the extensive benefits package they offer.

Cons: Too much politics takes place within the company
Advice: None
Pros: Nice company to work for.

Cons: Work a lot , requires you to work more than other companies.
Advice: None
Pros: Learn A lot by working for many projects

Cons: Selling Azure is not fulfilling. Unless customers have a very clear potential project and specific needs, there are very little technical resources to show customers the art of the possible. There are very high requirements (in terms of upfront budget) to get customers into any enablement programs. You learn from managers that it's better to move quickly and focus on bigger customers than to take the time to really understand the customer's business and pain points.
Advice: Every sales role should have a dedicated technical specialist. Vendor technical teams (Cloud solution architects, support) put very little effort in their interactions with customers and slow down momentum/frequently create frustration for sellers and customers.
Pros: With no technical background, I now have way more technical knowledge and many certifications to show for it.

Cons: Hehe hoohoo haha i no funny
Advice: None
Pros: Nice compoany very cooll haha

Cons: Sometimes slow paced, poor documentation, vague expectations, no morale budget
Advice: None
Pros: Great technical managers, low pressure work environment, growth mindset, flexible

Cons: Management is chosen based on friendship and a push for diversity regardless of qualifications or competence.
Advice: Quit.
Pros: Decent pay, although it is pathetic compensation versus their competitors. Always harp on the nations best “benefits” even though Facebook, Google, Apple, etc. are just as good.

Cons: -Getting to solve technically and politically complex problems (this a pro that can also be a con since it can be stressful and lead to burnout but also keeps an engineer interested/engaged, and can be fulfilling) 

-High case loads (95% of which are complex and probably effect some C-suite exec or other VIP user) which can add stress and eventually lead to burnout.
Advice: Continue hiring and trying to better manage engineer case loads to prevent burnout and attrition/turnover. 

That said, my direct management as well as senior management has been phenomenal here and I plan to stay for many more years.
Pros: -Total compensation package

-Benefits

-Leadership that cares

-Team culture based on collaboration and being "learn-it-all's"

-Ability to work remote (and free drinks when you do go to the office)

-Getting to solve technically and politically complex problems

Cons: Not easy to communicate across teams
Advice: None
Pros: Good benefits, flexible work schedule (team dependent)

Cons: Did not find much cons except that refreshers are known to be smaller than other Faang companies
Advice: None
Pros: Amazing company for work life balance Team culture is great

Cons: - Impacted by layoffs often - Can be high stress
Advice: None
Pros: - Great growth mindset culture - Opportunities to advance - Culture is very important - Fair to great pay - Excellent benefits

Cons: Too big of an org. Takes a while to get promoted.
Advice: None
Pros: Great place to learn. Highly recommend

Cons: - Lots of ego
- bureaucracy, red tape
- reorgs basically 2x per year. Don't bother getting to know your skip manager. Also try not to let your team put too much effort into skip priorities, and definitely don't get suckered onto the tasks yourself - no one will care at review time.
- very Indian-male centric (somewhat racist, sexist, and very classist attitudes are pervasive - oddly mostly in the younger generations)
-stack ranks even though they pretend not to, pick your projects with care and fight low-visibility ones
Advice: Some care should definitely be taken to make sure inclusivity and growth mindset aren't just being used as buzzwords. Inclusivity in hiring needs to work on racism/sexism. Maybe some kindbof blind review process.  Also, performance should probably be scaled on hours worked - I'm not competing with guys who work 50-60 hours and are going to burnout in 2-3 years max. If that's the culture you want, cool. If not, fix it.
Pros: - Plenty of talent
- good comp, great benefits
- good performing stock
- generally good people

Cons: Navigating such a large company is a challenge.
Advice: None
Pros: Commitment to growth mindset at every level of the company.

Cons: 1. Really the main con is that compared to the rest of big tech: Amazon, Google, Meta, etc. the pay is embarrassingly low. It's so low that this con is precipitating other cons like:
2. being unable to retain talent as people are easily enticed by other companies due to the huge difference in pay
3. being unable to bring in experienced talent from other big companies due to the said difference in pay, hence the talent pool gets more and more diluted with mediocre talent
Advice: Do something about the compensation before it ruins the company and its reputation. Microsoft is literally perfect otherwise.
Pros: 1. The WLB here is so insane, it's crazy. But as a result, I think we pay for it in other ways - see con 1
2. Genuinely caring and empathetic work culture and leadership except when it comes to one specific aspect - see con 1
3. Compared to anything outside big tech, the compensation package is amazing
4. Brand recognition, prestige, company perks, visa sponsorship, etc.

Cons: The layoffs were not communicated clearly
Advice: None
Pros: Great Culture, work life balance

Cons: There's a lot of work to do, but always putting the employee as a priority.
Advice: None
Pros: You have everything you need to perform at your best.

Advice: None

Pros: Benefit is good. No pip

Cons: large bureaucracy slow to get things accomplished
Advice: more training for employees
Pros: Work life balance Benefits compensation

Cons: Communicating across many orgs can result in misses
Advice: Keep investing in the areas that will move the needle. It's great to see innovation at scale!
Pros: Incredibly smart people, moving faster than outsiders think we move and solving really hard problems at scale

Cons: Some orgs are political when moving up in career rather than the work you do. Career developmemt is sometimes dependant on your manager and how much they go to bat for you for promotion. Make sure you get on a good team with a good manager. Slow to develop and establish processes, programs.
Advice: Ensure you put in place actual great people managers and that they follow the leadership principles... and not fake it to get promoted and not actually care about their team.
Pros: Great company mission, principles, and giving back to community. Great employee benefits Depending on manager amd org great work-life balance

Cons: * Politics are a menace - it was unbearable from a PM point of view. * Very slow processes
Advice: Cut the politics out...
Pros: Microsoft is a huge corporate, within my Azure organization: * Professional environment, great engineering teams * Great benefits * Management is inspiring and enabling (but not always professional) * A place that encourages * Satya is nothing but truly amazing

Also, ban "participation awards" and the self congratulatory emails for should the very basics, and the widespread sugarcoating where even a massive, predicted and avoidable failure is described as an achievement.

Advice: None
Pros: You can find good and bad teams at any company, but the fact that there is a top down value placed on work life balance and employee welfare really does have an effect on team culture.

Cons: Microsoft health insurance is VERY GOOD, but in many occasions, it's complicated to get your benefits. Most of providers won't accept it at first, even tho you can submit the claims to get reimbursed later for 99% of them. But that's time consuming and mostly a waste of time for the providers to have back-and-forth communications with you to confirm whether they can take you in or not. Therefore, it ultimately affects employees' productivity by distracting us to spend time on worthless work.

Advice: Check your managers, some are super condescending and their position gets to their head. They micromanaged the time for some employees yet letting their favorites take extra long breaks.
Pros: It was nice working for Microsoft. I like how Microsoft is all about innovation and empowering its employees and everyone in the world basically.

Pros: Microsoft is a prestigious company.

Cons: * Sales and services teams have fragmented cultures that reflect the personalities of the local Sales General Managers more than the overall values of the company * Corporate vs. The Field is still combative, but improving
Advice: Sales leaders need to learn to better interact with the varied personalities of the technical experts there to support them.
Pros: * Amazing overall culture * Access to amazing resources to learn, grow, and just get the job done * Great pay and benefits

Cons: Microsoft occasionally forgets that they are a company and attempts to lecture on morality. Stay in your lane, megacorporation.
Advice: Microsoft is growing rapidly and won't slow down any time soon. Keep track of your people and treat them well - that delivers a better ROI than anything else.
Pros: If you are knowledgeable in the Microsoft ecosystem, working at Microsoft itself is the place to be. I'm compensated very well, have flexible working hours, and have been given the unique tools I need to succeed. I think I'm appreciated and compensated fairly for the amount of value I provide, which isn't very common these days.

Your manager generally only cares about their own next move
People in the company seem think they are superior to employees at other company which is funny and take such pride in the Microsoft logo itself. Microsoft became their identities and it's sometime unbearable
Diversity and Inclusion: This is very INTERESTING here. because they do hire people with diverse background. I know someone in HR and I've been told by her as well as seen it myself that someone that is way more under qualified will get hired because they fulfill certain diversity quota. I personally know a friend who fulfill these "criteria", she has gone on an one month vacation without actually taking days off, manager noticed this and she still proceed to take one more week. HR cannot fire her because they need the PR and she still works there today while probably working 1 to 2 hours a week because she know she cannot be fired.

Advice: None
Pros: If you want to hustle and overdeliver (at least this is the fact in sales) then you can. And the company will recognise and promote you. I have seen rapid promotions with multiple top talents. Very rewarding.

Advice: None
Pros: Schedule is flexible to a point

Cons: Management encourages and rewards a timid approach to new features and is self congratulatory for tiny shifts in metrics. We don't stay the course long enough to see the vision for a project end-to-end and ultimately ship watered down fragments to test the concept, which never gets revisited. There's a pervasive culture of leading with 'no' and risk aversion
Advice: Committed to the full scope of projects. They tend to have much bigger payoff for customers.
Pros: We're bringing in more diversity through the intern program. 

The company is very inclusive. A few examples: Every major event has both subtitles and a live ASL translator. Pronoun usage is encouraged to be inclusive to trans folk. There is a specific hiring program for autistic individuals.

Advice: create a more streamlined contracting and licensing approach.
Pros: The benefits and pay are great, when you can actually over achieve your number

Cons: Many managers at the principal and above level do not exhibit those company values. In those same bands, it's common to see constant land grabs and people forcefully inserting themselves into workstreams to "add value."
Advice: None
Pros: Could be a con, but I love the inclusive and liberal values the company pursues. As a culture, with their training, semi-annual reviews, etc. there is a wide range of ways that try to make sure you understand and exhibit the values they espouse. Amazing benefits as well! It's great to feel like you're working for a company that is driving toward a greater good.

Cons: Salary compensation takes a big dip between years 3-6 which is when you see most folks at Microsoft leaving. I left close to year 4 to get my fair market price. Most people come back to Microsoft as a Senior PM or higher for work life balance and to chill. The majority of new hires have more than 7-10 years of experience. I noticed that I saw more Senior and Principal PMs than PM 2s towards the end of my career. Let that sink in. 

Microsoft is a Service provider. They care more about supporting more and more platforms and languages aka growing horizontally ("We need to support a Python on App Service, and Rust on App Service... and every other language and version!") than making what they have into a spectacular product. .NET releases and support takes up big chunks of dev time. Resources tend to get spread thin with so many things to support and less progress is made from a customer experience and feature set standpoint. 

The upper leadership moves very slowly and doesn't like taking risks. If you're a fast mover, you'll likely feel "slowed down" or "asked for further justification as to why it fits on the current roadmap" very often by upper leadership. If you're frustrated by this,
Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft was so valuable in teaching me skills I could use to be an effective program manager at scale. Getting to interface with an external product with thousands of customers has been awesome and I've gotten to learn how to collaborate and create roadmaps with the technical writers, software engineers, and fellow PMs of my product. I also really loved getting to dive deep into customer telemetry and come up with data-driven decisions. Microsoft has a great infrastructure to do so.

I was fortunate enough to be a PM right out of college in Azure Developer Division which focuses on Developer tooling. I think Microsoft set me up with the enterprise-level industry experience that has made me a competitive candidate out in the market.

The people there are very intelligent and work hard within the bounds of a VERY healthy work life balance. People take plenty of vacation and days of throughout the year. I've loved the folks I've worked with for the most part and managers are awesome!

- Large scale means slow moving, many hurdles and processes to get changes and developments into production (rightfully so, but can reduce enjoyment)
- Success of Azure has changed culture to be a bit more "results" oriented (You won't get acknowledged for addressing fundamentals)

Advice: How good your life will be depends entirely on your manager.
If you are unlucky your tenure will be short.

Microsoft does reorgs yearly it seems.
The management does not seem to match people with teams very well after a reorg.
If you end up in a team that is not a match the you are stuck and will have to look for another job.

Finding another position inside Microsoft will require that you interview again, exactly as if you applied from outside Microsoft.

There are many companies that pay much better and offer more interesting work.

I cannot recommend Microsoft.
Pros: Reasonable work life balance if you are in the right team

Cons: Vaccine mandate; Chaotic product planning; Bad Work/Life balance; Internal tools can be terrible; Politics win over technical excellence
Advice: This is advice for GPM (Group Program Manager) / skip-level managers on my most recent team in particular:

Don't sit in an ivory tower, separate from the day-to-day realities of engineers. Structure your communication channels in Teams such that the team actually feels like a team. For unknown reasons, our communication was spread out over multiple Teams groups: my team was forced to keep its channels in a Teams group for the larger org; I have no idea where the other engineering teams communicated with each other. I wasn't even sure what our org structure looked like - who worked on our product across the globe. We should have had an All-Hands meeting once per quarter - not once per year. Or maybe an update email here and there.

Perform user research BEFORE you ask engineers to implement a feature. On my team, most of the features we implemented got cut just before or just after they were finished - because user research had only just finished their testing (without using the stuff we had just built - so building it was unnecessary). Lots of engineering time was wasted, and it was demoralizing.

In addition, don't keep piling pressure on engineers along the lines of "We should have shipped already!" when PM / design / user research haven't even decided what we should be building!!! It's laughable to have a fixed launch date when you don't even know what your new product wants to be.

And if PM / design go through the process of cutting features in order to speed up the time to market, maybe involve engineers in that process. Otherwise you might end up creating MORE work instead of reducing it!! Re-designing an entire website &amp; adding new features in response to feature cuts is NOT how you reduce work for engineers!!

The good news: My immediate manager was competent. Most GPMs and skip-levels at Microsoft are more competent than the leadership of my most recent team. It was a mess.
Pros: Nice People; WFH; Job security; Yammer (internal social media); Lots of DLs/groups; Mature engineering practices

Advice: Please find leaders who truly embrace Microsoft value and not just talk about it during Poll time.

Cons: Lower compensation compared to other top tier companies.
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance, engineering excellence.

Cons: When there's a re-org happening, cross your fingers and wish that your nice boss doesn't get kicked out. Nothing worse than a dishonest and selfish manager that only seeks his own benefit.

Cons: Pay for work experience is low.. can't retain experienced folks
Advice: None
Pros: Ethical company Everything is ok .. no extremes Good intelligent people to work along Enough Flexible work environment

Cons: Horrible pay, very low balled
Advice: None
Pros: Great people and team mates

Cons: The main complaint I hear from people leaving Microsoft is that they want to make more money or get promoted. 

As I mentioned in the pros, turn over at MS is pretty low by design. But that does mean that compared to other places, the opportunity for promotion and big raises is smaller as well. Generally people either leave by year 2 or stay for 7 to 8 years at least. There's a lot of people who have been there for a very, very long time. 

Also, good work life balance and culture is the stated goal at Microsoft and most teams seem to follow it, but not every team is the same. 

There are a lot of different teams at MS and reorgs seem to be fairly common -- though it seems about the same as at any large company, not particularly bad here.

My team only just started doing sprints. For the previous year plus I've worked here, I've struggled without the framework of agile that I'd become used to at previous work places. It's getting better on my team, and I know that's super team dependent as well.
Advice: This is a great place to work, but only because I'm on a team with a good manager. Most managers seem to be good managers here.
Pros: I started at Microsoft a few months into the pandemic and from day 1 I've experienced management as compassionate and committed to taking care of people as people. 

Crunch has been rare on my team. 

I work on a service large enough that I'm only the on call engineer about once every 3 months. 

Perks+ benefits -- a yearly reimbursement amount of $1500 for health and wellness things. Personally I've used it to reimburse meal kits, a peloton subscription, pet insurance, and a massage envy membership. The list is really expansive. 

The average tenure at MS on my team is around 7 years. People stay a really long time because the philosophy is that they'd rather have you take a break than lose all the expertise you've  gained. Being such a large company, the code bases are large and the history is long on pretty much all the projects. The longer they keep you, the more valuable you become. More on that in the cons.

There's plenty of room to move internally when you're ready to do something different, and internal hiring is very common.

Specifically on coming out as transgender at Microsoft:
My wife and I pay zero dollars for our health insurance and have a copay of $20 for any doctor in the Kaiser system. The trans healthcare is especially affordable -- just $100 for any of the gender reassignment procedures. The wait lists are about 6 months for a transgender surgical consult, which isn't terribly short but it's certainly worse other places.  

There's an internal transgender community that has worldwide members. They've been an incredible support and place to belong. Changing my name and pronouns has been completely painless. A lot of my team is virtual and I've never been misgendered or dead named. I didn't even announce it beyond telling my manager and saying in my team chat "Hey I'm going by X now and updating my pronouns to y" and everyone just said great, congrats, and started using it.

Cons: hard to get promoted and intensive competition
Advice: None
Pros: Good food and WFH policy!

Cons: Many old timers in top level management who talk about D&amp;I but do not follow it. Retaliated and bullied by manager for raising a D&amp;I issue despite strong evidence. HR didn’t act to rectify either. D&amp;I is just in the books but not in practice at all: Some internal processes are extremely slow. Promotions are highly subjective and seem based on tenure instead of performance. Got top performer of the year last year and after raising a D&amp;I issue within 3 months , moved to bottom most performer despite all kudos and appreciation from 360 peer feedback. Ratings are at the mercy of the manager!
Advice: Standup for what is right and do not support old timers just because of their tenure in the company . Makes the work place very toxic. Make performance ratings mix of a manger feedback and 360 peer feedback. Take away undue bullying power from 1st line management and do weighted average score from 360 feedback for performance.
Pros: Great company benefits. You can see some great people managers and leaders but also not so capable and very egoistic/arrogant who are still with the company due to their tenure. Leads to a toxic web of management circle sometimes due to their relationship with each other over years. Makes any good thing hard to surface after layers of politics.

Cons: stock bonus is a joke.
Advice: In such a big company like Microsoft, there are good managers and bad managers. you have to find the one that works well with you.

Advice: None
Pros: Extremely flexible. You can live your life as fully as you could ever expect to as a full-time member of the work force.

Relatively low effort. The actual tasks are not difficult but you have to keep yourself on track with the communications and schedules

Cons: pay is not good, promotion is slow
Advice: None
Pros: love the empowerment culture it is great

Cons: It is a giant company. You may get to influence your immediate work group, but the company as a whole may make decisions you don't really agree with.
Advice: None
Pros: They really try and take care of you. Was recently terminated due to layoff of a 200+ person group. They gave a great severance package that will last us a long time (1 to 1.5 years).

Cons: Is the Corporate BusDev team a deal team or a strategy team? The LT seems to be indexing toward the latter, not the former latetly. Newer hires are increasingly ex-consultants who are great at powerpoint but don't know how to manage or negotiate a deal or partnership, yet BusDev management expects them to advise CVPs and CEOs. Small size of the group means limited career opportunities especially once you hit Director level.
Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: The benefits and work/life balance

Cons: career growth is slow, unless you have a good sponsor

Cons: Decent pay, but Black female employees still make a very small percentage from non-Black females, and even more difference in pay and quality of treatment when dealing with male peers.
Advice: Be the company you promote publicly. Be the inclusive, caring, empathetic place that all individuals are recognized and rewarded for Model, Coach, Care...
Pros: The company does a good job externally in saying the right things and making it appear as though they really care about inclusivity, diversity, supporting marginalized groups. Also has great benefits and decent pay.

Cons: Microsoft touts a diverse and inclusive community, but I found that it was not accurate. The executives may come from all different areas of the world, but they are all from similar educational backgrounds, which means it lacks diversity in "thought" and to push against that is very difficult, if you have been at Microsoft less than several years.  They recruit a lot of people to join the company, since they are losing people to the competition and better salaries, but people that have been at the company for more than 15 years, make it very difficult for new people with "ideas", so the politics are hard to navigate. There are people that are trying to bring innovation to the company, but most of them are frustrated and have given up trying to make any significant changes to the culture or innovation, until they can find a new gig. 

Since new people are not very much embraced by the people that have been there for a long time, progress is very very slow. Primarily, why Microsoft does well in the market, is because they have a good brand, due to the leadership of Satya, but that's the reason, not due to innovation.

Many long-time "Softies" lack expertise in their work subjects, so they utilize agencies for most of the strategy and execution. If you really want to participate in the innovation of product or strategy, then I would suggest working for one of their many consultant agencies.

People are on Microsoft Teams all day, every day. There's no respect for people's time and people are constantly late for meetings, since they are stuck on the previous meeting. Executives assume that all day meetings = work, which it doesn't. Work still has to be conducted, so people don't write or work , until the end of the day, when they can finally get off a Teams meeting.
Advice: If you really want to have diversity and inclusion at Microsoft, then modernize as the other tech companies have during the pandemic, and allow for different types of people of thought. Please look beyond hiring in Redmond for talent or forcing outside talent to relocate to Washington. Also, there are so many executives that have been at Microsoft for 25 years that hold back the innovation and don't allow for other's opinions, hire executives that you will respect their voices. It's good to listen  and stop suppressing new ideas.

Lastly, managers need to limit the amount of meetings they have in a day,  as well as , having all of their workers on the meeting, which many times are unnecessary. Staffs are afraid of not joining a meeting, since managers will penalize them. Managers need to trust their staffs and conduct less meetings to create efficiency.  Workers are burning out, since they are stuck on 7 - 10 Teams meetings per day. Having so many Teams meetings doesn't encourage a healthy work/life balance.
Pros: The health benefits and perks programs are great. Total compensation is comparative, but base salary is less than the other big Tech companies. For middle management salaries, it's a great place to be, but for executives, they are not as competitive as an AWS or Google.

Satya is great and truly is inspirational for trying to change the culture of the company.

- culture is very team and manager dependent
- re-orgs are common, meaning you can't count on your team culture staying the same
- pushes everyone to participate in diversity and inclusion initiatives but doesn't reward those who do
Advice: - recognize and reward D&amp;I work
- consider better stock refreshers
- the culture is good, but not good enough to justify the low pay
Pros: - culture of teamwork 
- prioritize growth over immediate success
- not a blame based culture

Cons: Compensation is on the lower end compared to other FAANG companies
Advice: None
Pros: - Pretty good work-life balance especially in you're in an org which has mature products like Office
- No Micro-managers. Nobody stressing you about when you start work. Managers care more-so about your ability to get your work done, so highly flexible in terms of work hours.
- If you work on weekends, or after-hours that's seen as a negative because the idea is that you didn't manage your time wisely during the work week
- Unlike some other tech companies who are prioritizing employees needing to come into the office several times a week, Microsoft strongly adopts the hybrid model of work. You can choose to work fully in the office, half, or fully remote. Up to you and the discretion of your manager/org

Cons: To a very large extend, management at all levels, with only exception C-level) do not practice the model with their employees.

Cons: Need to think about it
Advice: None
Pros: Broad product lines W/L balance

Cons: Long hours sometimes. Lots of OT.
Advice: None
Pros: Team work is excellent. Staff are helpful.

Cons: Microsoft is a large company, and there are definitely still pockets of management that do not subscribe to the new culture, preferring to micromanage and exert a top down pressure to conform

Also, being a large company, your progress in your career is somewhat slower
Advice: None
Pros: Overall the environment at Microsoft is conducive to work life balance, and facilitates authentic connection and collaboration with coworkers

Managers mostly actually care, and your feedback is respected

Cons: Microsoft has many reorgs where you will leave your team and be placed in another team.
You will have no ability to choose your new team and not even know until the day of the reorg which is your new team.
And switching teams is really hard, most times will require an entire interview loop.

Given the number of reorgs and the many random team reassignments it is very likely that if you stay long enough you will end in a bad team for you.

So, do you feel yourself lucky ?
Advice: When doing a reorg the affected people should have input into which new teams they end.
Pros: Good work life balance, assuming your manager agrees :)

Cons: a lot of after work and calls
Advice: None
Pros: good company to work ,good salary

Cons: Nothing specific that I know so far
Advice: None
Pros: Work life balance, exciting projects

Cons: - Your experience here is completely dependent on the team that you get placed on. They preach "growth mindset" at the VP level, and then by the team it trickles down to the individual contributors it is a toxic environment, "old school Microsoft culture". 
- Backstabbing and overworking is rewarded
- Often times 24 availability is required, but not listed as part of the job requirements
- Internal movement in impossible unless you are Senior level. You are ghosted even internally
Advice: Practice what you preach and stop rewarding VPs who overwork and pressure those they are responsible for.
Pros: + Good pay
+ Literally nothing else

Cons: Latest re-org was very upsetting on so many levels, does not feel like a lot of common sense was involved.
Advice: I do feel they are trying to “right the ship”. It’s just a little more painful than it probably had to be.

Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: Great colleagues to work with, OK salary and benefits

Cons: Pay isn't competitive at all levels
Advice: None
Pros: Flexible time off, good culture

Cons: Low pay and it seems it will not get any better..
Advice: Increase the pay for senior band technical scientists by 20-35% to keep your top talent or FAANG would be happy/honored to keep poaching your top technical talents .. Not many great engineer/scientists would stay with Microsoft long term due to the aggressive offers top companies make to poach MSFT technical talents. CEO has done very small to address the lack of competitive total pay for senior (level 64 -66) scientists/engineers at MSFT.
Pros: good work life balance.
smart people.
stable IT company

Cons: - As in other consulting jobs, the need to fulfill with utilization metrics can become overwhelming.
- Working on demanding projects usually will require to work long hours, most of the times more than an 8-hour per day schedule.
- You will frequently need to invest your personal time for self study in order to stay relevant on your job.
Advice: None
Pros: - A great leader on Technology Industry.
- Opportunities to work on interesting and demanding projects.
- Opportunities to work with very bright, talented people and learn from them.

Cons: gets repetitive and boring after long time
Advice: None
Pros: enjoyed it for some time

Cons: Completely dissatisfaction might not good
Advice: None
Pros: Good As per work culturre

Cons: Many previous benefits like work life balance are starting to disappear. This exacerbates the tension over low compensation. Further there is a growing concern over new hires coming in with little to no experience at higher pay than high performing employees due to the discrepancy in retention and acquisition team budgets.
Advice: I would recommend adjusting the retention to acquisition team budgets as managers often in good faith will tell high performing employees to leave and come back in order to obtain market level compensation. This likely is costing Microsoft a tremendous amount and appears that Microsoft has to pay a premium for returning employees when they could have paid marginally more initially to increase employee satisfaction and productivity.
Pros: Microsoft prides itself on its culture.

Cons: Leadership can be hit or miss, and my leaders were very poor. Didn't feel like I got a fair chance at a promotion after outstanding contributions.
Advice: Make the Microsoft Store actually feel like part of the company, and do a lot more to ensure that the workplace environment is healthy both physically and emotionally.
Pros: Great benefits, including tuition reimbursement, discounts, and even some free services.

Advice: None
Pros: Word from home although team structure could be better in an office setting..

Cons: No work or life balance.
Advice: Reduce some of the demands for mandatory training, workshops, and learning that are sent on a weekly basis.
Pros: World-class organization, brilliant co-workers, culture fosters collaboration through a three-tier annual performance lens; your accomplishments, contributions to others, and how others contributed to your success.

Cons: Become a virtual robot with no life
Advice: None
Pros: A virtual environment that prevents you from being human

Cons: lower compensation compared to other tech company
Advice: None
Pros: decent place for growth at early stage

Cons: Less Learning Rewards not always related to performance
Advice: None
Pros: Work Life Balance Moderate Pay Average Leadership

Cons: HR policies can be tricky to navigate during role changes or moves. Salary can be significantly impacted.

Cons: Needs improve in some aspect’s
Advice: None
Pros: Vero organized company and technology

Cons: There are not really any that I could think of.
Advice: none
Pros: The company cares about you in the long run.

Cons: Microsoft's mission is to empower every person and company to achieve more but it often doesn't practice that in reality.

Employee growth is touted as a vitally important part of their corporate culture with various constructs and processes that seem to also encourage this. However, no matter the policies, procedures or training, my experience has been nothing but the opposite.

In my time, i've witnessed ableism towards colleagues that had disabilities and even myself once I developed a disability that I partially contribute to my experiences.

I've also heard stories of Racism and discrimination too.

Managers, teams etc were always talking in secret, sabotaging each others projects. Referring to each other negatively. Playing political games to get things done and generally making my life miserable.

Eventually, I started struggling in my position beyond the above issues. I developed anxiety, stress and depression. The heightened level of anxiety in everything at work lead to me dreading starting work.

The pandemic actually helped, at least I didn't have to be physically in the same location as the people who were causing the issues.

During this time, I developed stress caused epilepsy. Too much stress I get a seizure... yay

My manager never helped with these issues despite me asking. 
My skip level booked some meetings with me but always left early and said they'd re-schedule. They never did.
HR of course is a no-go, they're designed to protect the company and don't really care about you.

I felt I had nowhere to turn to, with my mental health declining and my sense of self worth flying out the window I had to leave.

I'm exceptionally disappointed

Call me Neurodiverse or whatever you want
Advice: Practice what you preach, weed out the people at your organization that play political games and treat their employees badly.
Pros: - Benefits - are amazing, they cater for everything non-work that you can think of
- Stability - No matter what you know you're working for Microsoft

Cons: There are so many side programs, labels, allyships, and everything else that it has become a drag on results and performance. Internal movement is hard as the internal hiring process is awful and slow.
Advice: Need to decide what the company engages on as a real issue - when every issue is a top priority issue, nothing really is, and it all becomes noise.
Pros: Strong benefits, opportunity to make a real difference in one of the world's largest cloud providers.

Cons: Upward mobility is tight. You need to make sure you come in where you want to be because it's hard to move up and jump levels once you're in the door.
Advice: None
Pros: It's the 2nd Most Valuable Company in the world...

Cons: Pay is low. Politics at higher level.
Advice: None

Advice: I have any advice for
Pros: Everything was a good point in my view

Cons: upward mobility, corporate hierarchy, commute
Advice: None
Pros: good experience, good benefits, good vacation

Cons: Let's be real. No company is perfect. Work is work. But for sake of not being "everything is perfect,"

- It's a huge company. The endless abyss of information, acronyms, jargon, etc can be obnoxious. Onboarding can be comical. Where do I find xyz? What's actually important? What version of comparable documents is the "right" one? But that's easily combatted by asking someone who knows.

- Huge company means lots of "hurry up and wait." Let's be honest, that's frustrating. You're bound to encounter differing opinions and such. "Looks good, but ope, now there's feedback from another group, and now we need approval from xyz. Glad I stressed about this yesterday when it turns out it's gonna sit for another week.
Advice: None
Pros: Whether they genuinely care about their employees as humans or not, they at least do a darn good job of acting like they do. Microsoft is a rare company that understands "if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your company."

- I dare you to find a better 401k match. 50% on any contribution amount, up to the government's limit. AND it vests immediately. It's yours from day one. Literally $10,250 of free money on top of normal compensation.

- Healthcare is great. Tier 1 in the US for sure. Maybe there's a couple companies out there with better coverage. But Microsoft doesn't charge you for it. Literally zero dollars out of the employee's paycheck. There's a fee to add a spouse or domestic partner denying their own company's coverage, but that's fair. Also no added cost for dependents. That's amazing.

Parental leave. They match the WA State policy of 12 weeks (+ more for birth mothers). It's super easy to take advantage of, and it's available Day 1 of employment. It's unfortunate that this benefit feels "special" in the US, but I'm thankful for it.

- Base is competitive. But actually competitive. Not how bs companies say it as a way to compete with you for the lowest pay possible. They get it. They need and want to get quality people, and keep them at Microsoft.

- Any negative culture stigmas from a couple decades ago are gone. The culture now is relentlessly supportive and accommodating. Work life balance is preached. We're all adults here, trusting other adults to do their job, regardless of what hours they need to do it.

- Signing bonus + stock bonus + annual bonus. Work hard, get more. Beautiful.

I've historically cringed at people who spewed love for their company on Glassdoor. It always screamed "I'm and HR drone posting fake reviews to cover up all the bad ones." But here I am. Not an HR drone, a real human grateful to be in the Microsoft bubble. Believe it or not.

Wont push back to senior leaders and are very complacent. Also there are some managers that will use your work and present it as their work. The review and bonus structure is highly subjective and unfair.
Advice: Vet you managers better, left the company twice as I got stuck with bad managers who were only put in those positions for promotion and not for their leadership. Very subjective when it comes to reviews. A culture should be on results, should he objective and rewards should not be based on who is on your " country club"

Pros: &gt;Management policies emphasize employee mental health and workload management. Low toxic environment as compared to companies such as Amazon/Netflix.
&gt; Teamwork is appreciated and accounted for during promotion cycle conversations

Cons: Work-life balance, managers too empowered
Advice: The company is unmistakably amazing, it has outstanding values, great benefits, and an overall culture that makes you feel part of the family, you learn all the time and it has an amazing diversity and inclusion spirit. Work-life balance isn't so great, and you can end up working sunrise to sunset to meet objectives, and your results are only reviewed by your manager. Great managers give you the best experience of your life; not-so-great managers make life unbearable.
Pros: Benefits, growth, pay, stability, communication, flexibility

Cons: Sometimes difficult to get promoted, due to various team pockets (of resources/value) and due to reorgs.
Advice: Smarter emphasis on promotions, looking through frequent reorgs and other organizational limitations.
Pros: Great compensation, benefits, life balance, drinks, locations (WA east side), and tuition reimbursement. Strong emphasis on autonomy, inclusion, collaboration, life balance, and philanthropy.

Cons: If you're below a certain job level (e.g., L65), Microsoft is really cheap on your total compensation compared to other big technology companies like Meta, Alphabet, or Amazon. People have been leaving in droves during the great resignation to go to competitors that have been paying more, and Microsoft is now realizing it needs to do something to stop the bleeding of early and mid-career to competitors and startups. 

Despite knowing employees are unhappy with compensation in this high inflation &amp; high gas cost environment, the company leadership isn't doing anything transformational that makes Microsoft the leader when it comes to compensation. The company is doing across the board salary cuts between 10% and 15% for employees in certain states like Texas, Florida, and Georgia (no exceptions), and this is in no way beneficial to the employees in these states as they try to grow their presence and recruit people there.

Microsoft is also a "rest and vest" culture where there have been people who have stayed at the company for 20+ years and don't have to do much work. If you're looking for a place to increase your career trajectory velocity, definitely look somewhere else. Career progression is super slow at the company. If you've got an advanced degree, Microsoft won't compensate you extra for that either. Think more than twice before opting to take a job at Microsoft - especially if you're a new grad.
Advice: Stop being cheap and actually be competitive with your total compensation and benefits. Other big tech peers (and even startups) are steamrolling you in this category while senior leadership continues to tell people "think about the work-life balance that you get". It is frustrating and makes people feel not valued at all. I know you're thinking about keeping the SG&amp;A line item on the balance sheet minimal and trying to maximize net operating income by keeping salaries cheap, but it is a terrible long term strategy for attracting and retaining good people. Also, if you're going to cut salaries of people in different states without telling them (after they have moved there during the pandemic), at least come forward with explaining why you think their new lower salary is good and attractive for them. I know you wouldn't do that, but some explanation is better than no explanation.
Pros: I really like the benefits that are offered by Microsoft - they actually do a good job here. That is the only reason I gave 2 stars to the ratings for "Compensation and Benefits" - the benefits lift it up. Otherwise, it would be a one-star rating for that category.

Cons: Lower than other companies pay

Pros: Feel proud to work for a company that is so invested in D&amp;I and sustainability. And they added travel expenses to our health plan for states that don't give women freedom over their bodies. 90% of people I work with are bright, responsive, truly care about the customer. And all but one of my managers have been excellent.

Cons: - extremely low wages. $65k and under is starting for DC technicians

- 12 hour days. no flexibility on scheduling.

Cons: Overly hostile and political environment, esp in India region.
Advice: "Diversity" is being overly abused in Microsoft India. It is wrongly interpreted as "all-women organization" in many cases. Efforts are made to eliminate male candidates during interviews on "diversity" reasons. Even some male employees are made to leave the organization to be replaced by female employees again on "diversity" reasons. Hence "Diversity" is very feministically interpreted and implemented.

I hope top leaders of Microsoft see this post and do something significant about this. Please note, diversity does not mean "keep all ladies around". It is totally different.

Advice: None
Pros: Microsoft has a very good company culture and a great place to work.

Cons: It's very hard to explain without having lived it, but it's all politics. It's who you know over what you know. People are quick to judge you based on your looks and attitude. I'm not sure how/why it's bred this culture but they're not as "inclusive" as they seem. They breed an incredibly competitive culture where it's the norm to be incredibly selfish and highly judgemental of everyone and their work (they call it "being critical" and "defining impact").

Advice: Job is really hard coming into it from a programming background. Product knowledge is not abundant. It seems I'm not getting as much support as I would like. 😕 I honestly have no idea what else to put.

Cons: Your overall experience at Microsoft is very team dependent, with some organizations' actions contradicting the values set by the company's mission statement. This manifests in poor cross-team communication, misalignment of interests between teams, and tribalism. This leads to a poor collaborative culture where every team acts only in the best interests of their own team, and not for the company as a whole. How can you empower every person and every organization in the world if you can't even empower your own employees?

Compensation is not as competitive as other FAANG companies. While Microsoft comp is still very good compared to most non-FAANG companies, this signals that Microsoft is not willing to take the initiative to be competitive with their main competitors. What ends up happening is that the best talent ends up leaving for greener pastures and all the mediocre ones stay, causing a "brain drain" where engineering standards steadily decrease. Microsoft is not interested in retaining its best talents contrary to their claims.

It is much easier to interview external companies than it is to switch to different organization. If you want to transfer to a different organization within Microsoft (say, from Windows to Xbox), you have to apply to a job posting created by the organization of interest and go through an interview loop as if you're an external applicant. Assuming they even read your application, you being a Microsoft employee gives you no advantage as the loop does not take into account your positive Connects, manager testimonials, etc. I've made more progress in a few months' worth of external interviewing than I did trying to transfer internally for years. Yes, Microsoft is entrenched in various markets, but you most likely won't be able to enter most of them unless if you boomerang or have insider connections (which is outside of your control). Again, Microsoft is not interested in retaining talent despite Microsoft selling you on the idea that they want to keep and cultivate talent.

Work life balance is a hit or miss depending on several variables such as team dynamics, your seniority level, and the quality of your team's engineering processes. In my team, engineers are put in oncall rotations with little to no training in the product area, poor organization of information, and not being taught to take initiative in solving problems. This leaves the most senior, competent, and knowledgeable engineers being put on 24/7 virtual oncall where they can get pinged/paged/called/etc during off hours by engineers that are officially oncall but couldn't/wouldn't find relevant information themselves. I've even been texted several times to come online and help with an issue, WHILE I WAS ON VACATION!

Furthermore, if you're perceived as a competent engineer, expect to be stretched thin with increased responsibilities but little to no resources to deliver on said responsibilities. This led to competent engineers burning out while the mediocre ones are able to coast by. Even when brought up in one-on-ones, the issue was dismissed with a nonchalant "we tried but we can't fix it" response. It's almost as if Microsoft rewards mediocrity more than competency. There is an ongoing myth about Microsoft being the pinnacle of work life balance, but I find that it's mostly true if you're junior or are unmotivated.

Microsoft claims to be customer obsessed and seeks to offer a delightful customer experience, but my experiences with seeing poor development practices and seeing products fail the most basic use cases (implying a lack of quality testing) lead me to believe this is just another buzzword. Microsoft is more concerned about crossing off checkmarks and delivering fast rather than being honest about their products and taking corrective action. This leads to technical debt, loss of morale, and burnout.

On a slightly unrelated note; even during my tenure at Microsoft, I've favored competing products over Microsoft's counterpart. I'll use Google Docs over Word any day, Dropbox over OneDrive, and I ended up selling my Xbox One but kept my PS4. I'm not familiar with the teams behind those products, but based on my experiences here, I wouldn't be surprised if their lack of quality translated to my dissatisfaction with those products.

tl;dr your mileage may vary at Microsoft as each team is different, so be prepared to jump ship if your working conditions don't line up with their promises and your own expectations. I recommend Microsoft as either a resume booster or as a place to retire.
Advice: If you truly believe in the company's values such as customer obsession, cultivating talent, and growth mindset, walk the talk. Don't just talk the talk. Otherwise, employees who actually practice those values will leave for your competitors.
Pros: Good benefits like health care, 401k matching, donation matching, access to counseling service, etc.

Microsoft is entrenched in a wide range of markets from office productivity, gaming, search, mixed reality, etc.

Can find coworkers with a wide range of interests and hobbies outside of work, such as sports and gaming. Lots of internal mailing lists for different hobbies to facilitate meetups and community building.

Creative outlets in the form of yearly hackathons and The Garage, an independent group inside Microsoft that coordinates smaller hackathons and guest speakers relevant for certain topics such as game development and virtual reality.

Good place to retire or to jump start your resume.

Improve training opportunities for new technology.

Lots of smart and productive people.
Beautiful main campus in the Seattle area.

Advice: None
Pros: My current managers are bomb! The listen to me and they are always seeking to understand. Microsoft is all about growth, so they spend a lot of time helping me grow as an individual and as an employee

Cons: Can be underutilized and requires networking to grow in career, not just on achievements.
Advice: None
Pros: good work life balance if you allow it.

Cons: Microsoft offers below average compensation. Their stated goal is to offer compensation that is the 66th percentile of their competitors. In a letter grate that is a D. The promotion opportunities at Microsoft are severely limited. The best way to get paid more is to leave and come back.
Advice: The reason you are losing employees to Google and Facebook is not complicated. The reason is because you refuse to pay us as much. Even after Satya's announcement of increased compensation, it still won't match what I can get by going to Google or Facebook. That is why I am voting with my feet.
Pros: The people are mostly nice.

Cons: - Base salary could be a bit more competitive
