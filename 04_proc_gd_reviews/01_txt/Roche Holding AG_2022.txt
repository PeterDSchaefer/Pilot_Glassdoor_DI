Cons: Salaries are somewhat low - merits are not in line with inflation. Transform D has ruined the culture throughout the org - people don't feel secure and safe. It no longer feels like people first. 
Layers of leadership have been removed and the remaining leaders have too many direct reports across too many geographies. This has resulted in a focus on fire fighting and less on people development/growth. Leaders are grossly diluted and will burn out eventually.
HR and IT are awful. Everything goes through a Costa Rica call center and it takes days or weeks to get anything done. It is very cumbersome and broken. HR and IT used to be so supportive and localized. This is all gone and more and more functions are moving to a centralized model. It is slowly destroying the organization. I would wait 1-2 years for the dust to settle before joining the organization.
Advice: Leaders should not have more than 10 direct reports. Consider having a business area org structure model. The global centralized models have leaned out the org too much and it is creating hurdles and holding the org back. Go back to People First!
Pros: Excellent benefits, amazing 401k matching, Long Term Incentives for Director and above are great. Fair amount of work-life balance. Company is focused on customer/patient and a diverse workforce.

Cons: Pay raises below standard, with inflation this year and record profits Roche made, raises across nation are very low and was really discouraging to field workers who have been holding this company up while most haven't left their house in two years. 

Field workers have had to work insane hours and install a ton of instruments so the pay raises to appreciate this would have been nice, given the billions made. We are short staffed greatly already so worried this is going to cause even more Field Engineers to leave now.
Advice: Please review the pay and raises process, compare to other companies. We need to keep our skilled workers, we invest so much in training, its a shame to waste that time. Not to mention the burden it puts on others waiting years to get others trained is rough. We are drowning out here on call volume, we could really use more people.
Pros: Great benefits, great people to work with. State of the art instruments that provide so much for patients.

Cons: The pay is less than competitive with other local pharma companies.
Advice: Move your employees up the company ladder and you will see them stay longer.
Pros: Extremely positive work environment. There is a yearly bonus. Everyone there either wants to teach you something new or is simply friendly.

Cons: Poor and Unprofessional Management
Low Salary and minimal raises (no COL raises) not in alignment with market standards
Low Visibility and Recognition
Biased division of work/pay
Promotions based on nepotism and not recognition
Large corporate culture
Advice: Management is a result of right place/right time and not necessarily based on management skills or who is best for the position. Visibility is lacking and so is recognition.  Managers have too many direct reports to invest in developing their people, and check ins are not a priority. Promotions and raises are not based on individual accomplishments, but more so on nepotism and minimal standardized raises for "meeting expectations".
Pros: Great Products
Invests in R&amp;D

Pros: easy flowing, individual work, with emphasis to grow your career.

Cons: Toxic management within the shared service center. 
Annual reviews and merit/bonuses go to those who work the least amount in the department but can talk a good talk.
Managers don’t show appreciation to those who do their jobs or those who go above and beyond. Those who do go above and beyond get compensated less than those who talk about everything they do. (When those people probably work 20 hours a week then add overtime to their time cards)
Advice: Really take a look at who is doing the work on the team. It isn’t always the ones who talk a good game. Actually look at the metrics you pull, the meetings with stakeholders the individual handle, get genuine peer reviews with those who work with the person. Stop playing favorites because someone “looks good and presents themselves well”. If the person who does the best work isn’t the one who presents themself well, teach them. Constantly giving those who don’t deserve opportunities promotions and bonuses doesn’t get the job done.

Amazing people

Cons: The company has been undergoing a major transformation over the last year, as such nearly half of our experienced people have been let go, left the organization or have moved to new roles. Employees have been jumping ship left, right and center over the last year, creating massive knowledge gaps throughout the organization that have generated a lot of chaos, reactive ways of working and the feeling that the house is on fire. Although the company has gained a tremendous amount of new business, management refuses to grow the headcount accordingly to support these new customers.

Pros: Pay, benefits, training, colleagues, management

Cons: Poor management and lots of favoritism
Advice: None
Pros: Salary and work environment is great

Cons: - You won't get the pace of a start up. - Several too-ambitious R&amp;D projects fail, which leaves especially engineers gutted. - The Rotkreuz location is a long commute from any major city. - Frequent re-organizations carry inefficiencies and attrition. Those occur every couple of years on a smaller or larger scale. - High mobility does not necessarily imply fast career progression. Progression highly depends on current situation and luck. Also, women have a faster track, making some opportunities harder for men.
Advice: None
Pros: Best company I ever worked for. - Strong culture of empowerment. - Extremely high average quality of people: constructive, competent, ambitious. - Ambitious projects that push teams out of their comfort zones. - Quality is appreciated; if you try to propose an improvement in quality or efficiency, it's screened objectively, as opposed to most companies affected by change-resistance. - Treats people well. Strives to stay a great employer. Average stay in the company is 20 years (!!). - Values continuous education. - Well-resourced; they buy the best tools for the task. - Plenty of opportunities for mobility within the company. - Plenty room for work-life balance. You can opt to dedicate little energy to your work, that'll obviously affect your chances of career advancement. - Phoenomenally competent, effective and mostly inspiring management.

Cons: -Horrible co-workers with lots of politics and causing a toxic work environment
-Sups are oblivious to the politics in their team and act as if nothing happened.
-Refuse to listen to the biotechs at all times and think that all faults are in the biotechs (blame culture)
-"yes" man culture
-good biotechs who can deliver work are not appreciated and seen and most of the times, given more workload than the rest of the biotechs, causing mental health distress and burnout
-mental health talks are all 'talks' and no 'walks'
-Horrible machinery that breaks down often and expecting the biotechs to pick up the work and rush
Advice: You can give as many talks abt how you care abt mental health but if the problems on hand is not solved, there is no way your biotechs will be happy. It's not always yoga and eating well

The blame culture is strongly embedded in manufacturing side to the point i have seen biotechs getting minor panic attacks on the shopfloor because of documentation error. Every small little things that gone wrong, need to go through an unplanned event which is a waste of manpower and time.

Lastly, there will not be a perfect batch if your machinery keeps breaking down and causing distress to the biotechs. The plant is old and not well kept, probably start upgrading a few systems and reduce the red tapes.
Pros: -Good Salary
-JD for biotechnologist has been streamlined to ensure that main operations and not additional non value added work is given to biotechnologist
-Good opportunities to move around if you wanted

Cons: -Hierachical structure, seniority is not always recognized, it depends on your manager/department mgmt. This can change position to position
- Development and project participation will depend on your manager's decision/approval
- High number of meetings and emails can consume your time and can be very draining on a daily basis
- Heavy workload due to regular workload plus lots of constant changes. Examples: you will often need to learn new procedures, new technology to use, new process, new department names, new organizational structure, new management, new training, new requirements and so forth. Work-life balance may be challenging
- As others mentioned: your role is likely to change within a few years, long term stability could be questionable
Advice: None
Pros: Despite cons mentioned below, I recommend to work in this company. 
Pros:
-Great work experience
- One of the best paid in industry
- Very senior management keeps everybody informed through videos
-Development opportunities are available, horizontal movement is possible
-You will get the latest industry and technology available, ahead of most companies (this is one of the biggest assets)
- Colleagues are always open to help and easy to reach
- Many events to participate
- Flexible work schedule with ability to work remotely
- Time off work due to family reasons or others will be allowed

Cons: A typical bug pharma with complex historical processes/systems and confused ways of working. It appears the employees were’nt ready for the new transformation with agile ways of working but were thrown at deep ends to lead by themselves and create a self-managed team?!?
Advice: The focus should be on actual work rather than the extra-curricular projects which do not directly link to foundation work. Like any other company, Roche too focusses on visibility of a person which is equal to more bonus, irrespective of whether the so-called visible person truly lives the values.
Pros: Roche allows all employees to bring their authentic self to work. The concept of agile ways of working ia amazing!

Cons: -Lot of transfers and changes putting pressure on the teams
- Sometimes chaotic process and project management due to knowledge gaps and time pressure 
-No reaction to feedback. 
-Salary left way behind inflation which is unfair observing the changes and raising responsibilty/accountability expectations.
Advice: Listen to and ask for employee feedback. Slow down a bit with the transfers ans changes so everyone can breathe a bit. Carefully pick project and process responsibles so they understand what they are doing and what is expected.
Pros: 'Global company in healthcare industry
- 4 home office/week 
-Training opportunities
- Team Spirit Applause Reward system 
-Growing service center with career opportunities 
-Better cafeteria benefit for 2022 
-E2E scope in most AP areas so you can learn everything.

Cons: - Roche UK (not other locations) don't remain competitive with overall comp/benefits vs. other UK based pharma. companies 
- Fail to recognise / compensate when staff take on new roles with greater responsibility. Always have to fight to get somewhere near market rates
- UK is considered a 'low cost' site for Roche and there's pressure to keep costs down which in turn leads to inability to recruit / retain the best talent
Advice: None
Pros: - Work / life balance is good. Remote working is an option
- Self empowered teams
- 'Gig' culture is becoming the norm, offering good development opportunities
- Awesome UK office
- Strong product pipeline

Cons: Culture can result in really slow decision making. Lot's of transformations ongoing, with a focus on Agile, which isn't always appropriate for org design especially when leadership doesn't have the appropriate Agile mindset.
Advice: Not everything needs to be Agile. Do better at promoting Leaders who share the stated Roche values. Too many poor leaders in middle/upper management.
Pros: Friendly and warm colleagues. Still better treated than some peer companies in Basel.

Cons: smaller teams are usually squeezed dry due to the many scrums and projects. The workload is not manageable due to the changing landscape, meaning a single person will have to handle the current role and responsibilities while trying to juggle into the new role, while roles that cannot be eliminated in short period and thrown to many single contributors or administrative roles.
Advice: during the changes, many smaller departments are left behind struggling.
supporting roles are often "forgotten" in changes. Many supporting roles or individual contributors are working long hours, easily 10-12 hrs per day.
Pros: Great vision, people-oriented. Want to create the best for patients and a generally collaborative mindset.
Established and strong R&amp;D

Cons: -Roche is not challenging themselves in terms of innovation. I have heard times again people thinking that there is no other company better, but that is simply not the case. Coming from a different environment, I can say for a fact that some other companies could teach Roche a thing or two if they were humbler. The start up day was also an excellent example of Roche being extremely arrogant and patronizing towards people who could have taught them. 
Innovation teams are very senior and poorly diverse and you can feel it in the quality of proposals. Attitude towards risk taking is very adverse.
- The commitment to Diversity and Inclusion in general in Europe is not sufficient, I have been in situations in which team leads had some very racist and sexists attitudes and comments towards women and people of color. I found that HR and leadership did respond to these comments but very slowly and the atmosphere festered for a long while making it painful for others. The diversity on the board and other major leadership teams is also appalling. 
- The management of the pandemic was poor and management refused to acknowledge it. In public office hours people were told again and again to get on with it and that it was going to get better. Sometimes it's better to recognize that you simply do not know what will happen instead of pretending that you can predict the future of a worldwide pandemic.
Advice: Open yourselves to advice from people who want to make the company better. Don't be defensive about what you do not yet do well. It won't help, and it just drives people away who could otherwise have help. If you take a serious commitment towards D&amp;I and especially LGBTQ+ equality make sure that this is felt in the whole company and not just  in specific pockets of the company. Give people time and money for the work they do on these topics instead of asking them to volunteer.
Pros: The company has been there forever, and it is very stable.
They are very committed towards sustainability, and they walk the talk.

Cons: Such a big company at times requires us to be patient through change and Roche historically goes through a lot of change. You need to be resilient and understand the bigger picture to succeed here.
Advice: None
Pros: I’ve had the privilege of the last 20 years to grow my career at Roche. I’ve been lucky enough to have amazing leaders who believed in me and saw potential. I work hard and am curious but I also needed to be brave and I got this confidence from my leaders.

Cons: Current transitions are confusing and it can be difficult to figure out who to go to for help.
Advice: Newly hired people require more guidance and mentorship
Pros: Friendly environment with a lot of support and available resources

Cons: HR presence not strong, not enough safe avenues for employees to speak up. Middle management biased, promotion based on favouritism. Employees who speak up are penalised.
Advice: Pay more attention to ground staff and leadership competency of middle management
Pros: Good benefits overall good company culture. Great for learning and growth opportunities.

Cons: Process keeps on changing. Need to perform a lot of task and hold multiple roles but the pay is considered low.
Advice: None
Pros: Mature organisation and they have good HR. Flexi points for the staff.

Cons: Communication among the stakeholders is sometimes lacking.
Advice: Keep it up!
Pros: Great people to work with. They are flexible and open for feedback.

Cons: high workload to much information and changes new systems constantly not so good work life balance management is too young high expectations
Advice: None
Pros: good benefits and salary great teams and collaboration many events, something always happens multinational company career opportunities

Cons: Toxic working environment. After losing major tender, for being arrogant and expensive. Despite years of reshaping and rebuilding, they haven't learned anything and continues to be arrogant.
Advice: Spending all the time and effort to transform and be more agile means nothing if your managers don't lead the way. Everyday I turn on my PC and the Roche wallpaper says "be a better version of ourselves" or "be customer centric". What happened to the pillars? Where's the spare parts to fix broken machines.
What about staff? No parts is one thing, but no engineers to fix instruments is another.

Roche Diagnostics Australia should be better than this.
Pros: The prestige of working for Roche in Australia.

Cons: - they hire overqualified people (which is why I left. I entered because I thought it would be a good entry level position into Roche, but there was no mention on how to progress further and in other career paths)
Advice: None
Pros: + the office in San Cugat is great + the food in the canteen is great (like really great)

Cons: Bad management. Unfortunately 1 manager up 3 was an amazing human being
Advice: It is a multicultural environment please note not all people can have same mentality and behaviour. The Hungarian one is not the must have but diversity is the key
Pros: Caffetteria, bonus, courses, salary and work life balance. Home office and private medical insurance

Cons: Hiding behind a process slows down things very much. The agile way of working, while good in some parts of the company, is either not widely adopted or is understood and "practiced" in a very different way than originally designed.
The organization culture deteriorated as well after the HR transformed itself towards "ticket-based" ways of working, resulting in focusing neither on People nor Culture development.
Advice: Retention and new ways of attracting talents should be the top priority right now. It seems, though, by the long transformation the IT is under, Roche may start "bleeding people" soon, especially the offered compensation is more and more disconnected from the market
Pros: A lot of possibilities for development, both on IT and the business side. Good environment and fantastic people

Cons: Limited development opportunity, limited challenges, system based. If you want to climb the corporate ladder, you will need to wait patiently. Business trip opportunity drastically declined after covid
Advice: Give opportunity to younger people. More perks and benefit! Also able to identify talent, is the best thing for a growing organization
Pros: Inclusive, flexible, real multinational company with great culture, great benefit, less demanding job, networking across region and excellent working environment

Cons: No Cons at all at Roche.
Advice: As Roche has acquired Viewics, some of its senior employees are not capable at global level.
Pros: Great company in Pune to work for.

Cons: The environment was completely toxic, overly on «&nbsp;Roche nice&nbsp;» allowing for harassaient, bullying and demeaning behavior. Extremely risk averse company with closed minded individual who fear change, likes to limit to status quo and no real support by managers
Advice: Take some course on implicit bias, harassment and toxic work environment. General coaching classes would also be highly recommended
Pros: Fair compensation. Innovative portfolio &amp; large global company

Cons: I always loved working for Roche, recently there is lots of restructuring ongoing which for me does not always makes sense, you can tell that Roche ties to save money wherever they can. I would also appreciate if long term employees would be promoted better but it seems like you have to change the company or position to move forward with your career
Advice: None
Pros: Great benefits and life work balance, quite flexible and great people (mostly)

Cons: It’s not a con for me but having to travel and be on the road could be demanding.
Advice: None
Pros: A dynamic and engaging job that allows me to work with external customers to help maintain and improve their experience with Roche.

Cons: Sometime it is too calm ;)
Advice: None
Pros: It’s a really calm workplace with supportive collegues

Cons: Management that are not results focused and have come from places where they played career ladders - more focused on titles and salary increases than business results.
Advice: Hire people based on results and not on paper or letters after their last name. They are toxic and will impact your bottom line in medium and long term.
Pros: Watch out for innovation “leaders” in the Irish offices

Advice: None

Advice: None
Pros: - Great Work environment - Flexibility - Great colleagues

Cons: 24/7 standby oncall duty alone. Superior care for customers only, request you to attend onsite within 1 hour during midnight. OT allowance very low. End-user does not handle the equipment well and not cooperative during remote trouble shooting
Advice: Please communicate with the customers regarding their end-users behavior. We as an engineer bullied by those non-educated end users. Please revise the current standby oncall duty as well as the OT allowance.
Pros: Overall good working culture among the team

Cons: Not as clinical as other roles within the organization.
Advice: None
Pros: Great role to understand system needs

Advice: Only advice to management is to train the leadership team to stop being biased.
Pros: Compensation is good. Company has great vision

Cons: Heavy workload, but still manageable. The company has been transitioning to Agile ways of working so me, being a newbie, has a steep learning curve to overcome. They fully expect you to be self-sustaining and self-managed, and it can be difficult without proper guidance especially in the beginning.
Advice: None
Pros: location-agnostic roles - check! You can go as far as you can with Roche, as they expect you to be the visionary and architect of your career development.

Pros: In advance, as an employee, who had the chance to work for different multinational companies in Budapest, I have to say Roche is a mile ahead of the competition.

You work in different roles at the same time but you only receive one salary
In my case, I had a boss who was bullying, disrespectful and did not put the responsibility on the fair people, but on the most overloaded because they were the most efficient.
Many people believe that because they are older they have a higher priority than others and do not respect the company's project prioritization processes.
There are very problematic people who are promoted to boss and are forgiven for their faults (workplace harassment, lack of respect)
